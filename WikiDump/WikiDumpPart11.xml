This keyword is used in:
*[[Ada Programming/Control#for loop|For loops]]
*[[Ada Programming/Representation clauses|Representation clauses]]:
**attribute definition clause
**enumeration representation clause
**record representation clause
**at clause (obsolescent)
* Quantified expressions
** Universal quantification
** Existential quantification

Nowadays ''representation clauses'' are formally called ''aspect clauses'' in the last versions of the Reference Manual due to some technicalities, although ''representation clauses'' is the name far more extended among Ada programmers. As a historical note, they were known as ''representation specifications'' (''rep specs'') in pre-Ada 83 proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|     author = [[Wikipedia:John Barnes (computer scientist)|John Barnes]]
|      title = High-Integrity Software &amp;mdash; The SPARK Approach to Safety and Security
|       date = 2003-03-25
|  publisher = Addison-Wesley
|       isbn = 0-321-13616-0
|        url = http://www.praxis-his.com/sparkada/sparkbook.asp
| accessdate = 2008-06-06
|      quote = Representation clauses are now strictly known as aspect clauses &amp;mdash; the name was changed in the 2000 Corrigendum for Ada 95 for subtle reasons that need not concern us; Ada historians might recall that they were known as representation specifications (rep specs) prior to the ANSI standardization in 1983. These various terminologies are all in use and the reader will encounter them in the literature. (pp.212&amp;ndash;213)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== For loops ==

 [''loop name'' {{Ada/delimiter|:}}] {{Ada/kw|for}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|in}} [ {{Ada/kw|reverse}} ] [''type'' {{Ada/kw|range}}] ''range'' {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    ...
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Where ''range'' can be:
* explicit range like &quot;&lt;code&gt;''low'' {{Ada/delimiter|..}} ''high''&lt;/code&gt;&quot;,
* range of scalar or array type: &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}}&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}''n''{{Ada/delimiter|)}}&lt;/code&gt; for multidimensional array types)
* range of an array: &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;array&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}} (or &lt;i&gt;array&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}''n''{{Ada/delimiter|)}}&lt;/code&gt; for multidimensional arrays)

== Representation clauses ==

=== Attribute definition clause ===

 {{Ada/kw|for}} &lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}&lt;i&gt;attribute&lt;/i&gt; {{Ada/kw|use}} &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Where ''attribute'' can be any [[:Category:Ada Programming/Specifiable attributes|specifiable attribute]].

=== Enumeration representation clause ===

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''enumeration type'' {{Ada/kw|use}} (''enum1'' {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} ''value1''{{Ada/delimiter|,}} ''enum2'' {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} ''value2''{{Ada/delimiter|,}} ...);

=== Record representation clause ===

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''record type'' {{Ada/kw|use}}
   {{Ada/kw|record}}
      ''component1'' {{Ada/kw|at}} ''offset'' {{Ada/kw|range}} ''first bit 1'' {{Ada/delimiter|..}} ''last bit 1''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      ''component2'' {{Ada/kw|at}} ''offset'' {{Ada/kw|range}} ''first bit 2'' {{Ada/delimiter|..}} ''last bit 2''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      ...
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

=== At clause (obsolescent) ===

At clauses are obsolescent since [[Ada Programming/Ada 95|Ada&amp;nbsp;95]]:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''id'' {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|at}} ''address''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

where ''address'' is of the type &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|System}}.Address&lt;/code&gt;.

An at clause is equivalent to &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|for}} &lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Address}} {{Ada/kw|use}} ''address''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Since Ada&amp;nbsp;95 this is the preferred method.

== Quantified expressions ==
{{Ada/2012}}&lt;br/&gt;

=== Universal quantification ===
[[w:Universal quantification|Universal quantification]] expression:

 ({{Ada/kw|for}} {{Ada/kw|all}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|in}} ''range'' {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} ''predicate'')

=== Existential quantification ===
[[w:Existential quantification|Existential quantification]] expression:

 ({{Ada/kw|for}} {{Ada/kw|some}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|in}} ''range'' {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} ''predicate'')

      <comment>/* Visualization enhances the learning process */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A theory is a set of statements that allow us to explain, predict, or control events (Smith and Ragan, 1993). A theory provides an explanation for observations made over time. A theory explains and predicts behavior. A theory can be modified. Theories are rarely discarded if tested, but sometimes a theory may be widely accepted for a long time and later disproved. There are two kinds of theories on which instructional design is based:

#Descriptive Theories
#Predictive Theories

Descriptive theories describe how learning occurs. Prescriptive theories describe what to do to achieve certain outcomes. Most instructional theories are prescriptive. They suggest that if instruction follows a certain form and process, then learning will occur. This will be a section on the theoretical bases for the field of Instructional Design. By many accounts, there are four, sometimes referred to as the pillars of the field [http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/s/j/sjm256/portfolio/kbase/FoundationsISD.html (McGriff, n.d.)]:


==Audio-Visual Foundations==

===Visualization enhances the learning process===

Hoban, Hoban and Zisman (1937) explained impact of visuals on the learning process based on the mental processing including differentiation and integration to reach ultimate goal of education generalization. An object cannot be understood totally without making connection to the differentiated situations concretely in real life. In this process, visual aids play a key role for presentation of differentiated situations. However, differentiation is the secondary process of integration because the differentiated object must be put into a category or class again in real life situation. The integration of several differentiated concrete experiences related to an object produces abstraction and generalization. In this process, visual aids support not only alone differentiation but also integration of lower to higher level for the generalization purpose. The other role of the visual aids is supporting the progress of concrete to abstract. In fact, concrete and abstract forms of an object are relative terms. One is start; another is end points. During the integration to generalization process, the transition from concrete to abstract must be smoothly otherwise the process sounds meaningless. For the concrete differentiation, real sample of the object that provides sense of weight, volume and textures are appropriate. To take this process one step further for abstract forms, the visuals are very critical. Hence, visuals can be still concrete to the person without some senses and 
Hoban, Hoban and Zisman called them as semiconcrete. They can support that smooth transition to the abstraction. In some cases, direct concrete experience is not possible so the visual aids take the direct experiences role, such as in geography or history subjects. 

The similar type of support came from Dale’s Cone of Experience (1946) related to visualization and learning. Like Hoban, Hoban and Zisman (1937), Dale talked about the decreasing concrete experiences of motion pictures and its place between direct purposeful experiences and verbal symbols. The visual materials both motion and still pictures put the transition point. He also stressed the efficiency of the visualization; that one can reduce unnecessary part of the experience and concentrate the related parts. In 1949, another forerunner of audio-visual education movement Jim Finn joined Hoban and Dale (as cited in Januszewski, 2001) and supported the idea of rich concrete experiences providing with audio-visual materials rather than just presentation of eye and ear experiences.    

In other words, visualization is important for making learning process meaningful via diverse representations of the content to support both retention – within relations and transfer – relations between the other contents. Moreover, learning processes become more effective and efficient if unnecessary and unimportant parts are dismissed via utilization of visuals.      
Like the vision of Oettinger (1969), the visual materials are still very important manipulative to teach abstract concepts currently. However, the role of visual materials are not limited to the progress of concreteness to abstraction but also tied to individualized instruction regarding learning style or type of an intelligence of a person. For example, Gardner’s (1983) multiple intelligence theory includes visual/spatial intelligence.

==Communications Theory==

Communications theory is related to information processing and longterm storage and retrieval of knowledge. In the information processing model, the source of a message works its way through a channel which is influenced by noise. Sending a message involves encoding and transmitting it. Receiving a message involves receiving a message and then decoding its meaning. The form and structure of the message is of concern to instructional designers. The purpose of communications theory is to increase knowledge and understanding of some knowledge or skill; and, to persuade and/or motivate retention of the same. Communications theory can aid in the design of instructional materials by facilitating the transmission of messages and information from one person to another.

=== Communication is a two-way process that permeates all aspects of instruction === 

The fundamental starting point of communication in field of AV was the basic discussion of Harold Lassweell in 1948; that “who says what in which channel to whom with what effect?” (p. 250, as cited in Januszewski, 2001). Based on that model, other scholars of AV field got their attentions to the communication. The following to this theory, the two field were connected to each other with the Journal of AV Communication Review in 1953. 

According to Dale (1953), communication is the process of taking the other in order to reach the common experiences mutually. To understand each other clearly, communicator must establish two-way communication where the feedback is the critical part. As experience sharing process between the teacher and learner, instruction must be realized in the context of two-way communication. Although Gerbner (1956) was one of the advocator of social framework of communications, he mostly emphasized situation, perceived context, and all aspects of the content, which are the important variables of instructional environments. The social framework of communication is more detailed explained than behavioral one in which AV communication was accepted as a one-way communication and linear act where the messages were transferred form one person to another (Januszewski, 2001). In this framework, the AV field was more associated with machine and equipment perspective. 

Like Dale (1953), Hoban (1977) criticized open communication systems and proposed monitoring and correction or evaluation for the process where the user could be part of information flows. With this way, he believed, the effectiveness of information transfer could be increased. The evaluation process was based on observations. For the instruction environment, teacher must understand the reaction of students to audio-visual materials and make necessary corrections if there are some problems. He stated that without evaluations it has been impossible to improve effectiveness of the materials. 

At this time, two-way communication is the still very important principle of instruction. For example, in a form of distance learning web based instruction provides tools for communication to enhance outcomes. Moreover, most of the message design principle are the stemmed from effective communication. The most common type of message design is screen design for educational software or web based course in the field of IT. In constructivist perspective, I believe, the source of the communication process is the students and the receivers are the teachers who send feedback to facilitate students again.

==Systems Theory==

One definition of a system is that it is a set of interrelated objects working together toward a common goal (Hall &amp; Fagen, 1975). In other words, the system has a purpose or goal; its parts are organized and hierarchical. General systems theory assumes that the natural world is ordered and rational; and, planning and creation of order are valuable activities. Systems theory provides a framework for us to order the world around us in our own minds. It helps us understand relationships between people and other people, people and things, and things and other things.

The environment places constraints on a system. Through feedback mechanisms, dynamic systems change when interacting with the environment. These changes can lead to progress or self-destruction. 

Instruction is a system because it is purposeful, organized, governed by processes and is comprised of a set of interrelated part working together toward a common goal. It is used to create meaning out of existing structures, create new structures and ways to organize information, and solve problems.

=== Systems thinking and relation to historical roots of IT ===

The systems thinking in education was explained as an iterative, high speed, mental process of the frequent analysis and synthesis, called anasynthesis (Silvern, 1968). Analysis process is explained as breaking down of a whole into the parts with demonstrating all relationships of the parts to each others and to the whole itself. For a system, the relationships must be meaningful from each peace to the whole. Silvern identified process of analysis into four steps: (a) identify, (b) relate, (c) separate, and (d) limit. Synthesis is the process of combining non-related elements into meaningful relationships that produces the new product as a whole system. The main distinctive characteristic of synthesis is production of new or innovative things. As well as analysis, Silvern expressed synthesis contains five basic steps: (a) identify, (b) relate, (c) combine, and (d) limit.

Over and above of Silvern’s system explanation, Churchman (1965) proposed two principles to keep the system works. One is housekeeping principle that supports the idea of when you see a mess, clean it up. This principle fosters immediate straighten of an existing system. However, if the system becomes more complex, housekeeping principle cannot be simple to apply. In addition to housekeeping principles, Churchman talked about two fundamental design properties of any part of a system: its benefit to the whole and its price. When the change made in any part of the system, the expected benefits of it must be assessed for the whole cost to the system. Hoban (1977) explained the efficiency of the AV field by using the communication systems. He also proposed that AV communication system that indicates interaction among basic components of communication system. He advocated that in order to understand huge social system that are really difficult to analyze, we need manageable sub-systems, such as AV communication system.          

The common characteristics of educational engineering process are classified into four ways by Charters (Januszewski, 2001): (a) systematic process, (b) applications of science, (c) efficiency for the utilization of resources, and (d) aims to produce for wealth. With the systematic process, the emphasized concepts were thoroughness or step-by-step procedure and impartiality of the truth. The systematic development of instructional methods and product was the part of educational engineering. Educational engineering’s basic areas were psychology, sociology, and mathematics, like industrial engineering and its basic sciences psychics, chemistry. Educational engineering were derived from these basic sciences. Based on the discussion of Silvern (1968), Churchman (1965), and Hoban (1977), it can be proposed that system thinking is related to systematic step-by-step procedures, efficiency, and production of wealth characteristics of educational engineering. Two different ideas focus on a production system including meaningful relations by using the most efficient ways for the valuable outcomes to the outer system in a standardized way.  

The risen interest on exact measurement and prediction-based methods and outcomes by emphasized by science of education view could be easily adapted to a procedural concept of educational engineering. For the science of education perspective, we can easily observe that system thinking ensures the consistent outcomes via using comparative exact measures of benefits and costs to control system for continuous production. 

Especially, Hoban’s (1977) AV communication system was a kind of reusable module for all types of growing technologies. Hence, Hoban developed that model for the systems difficult to analyze and complex social systems. In other words, it is the effective representation why we need to use technology in complex educational environments. This is the rationale for the efficient and effective use of technology. 

As far as the programmed instruction is concerned, keeping consistency of a system production and its expected benefits and cost is closely associated because the programmed instruction includes immediate correction of the system components - housekeeping, such as reinforcement. However, Hoban emphasized that the housekeeping principle of the programmed instruction could be thought as the efficient way for instruction unless its benefits and cost to whole system were considered. He added that one of the common methods for immediate correction was supplementing the problem part with emerging technologies. In my opinion, this point is one the most critical evidence for the disappearance of the programmed instruction tools in education systems. It also must be considered for the current applied technologies nowadays.

==Learning Theory==

Behaviorism, Cognitivism and Constructivism - The Basics

Behaviorism: Based on observable changes in behavior. Behaviorism focuses on a new behavioral pattern being repeated until it becomes automatic.

Cognitivism: Based on the thought process behind the behavior. Changes in behavior are observed, and used as indicators as to what is happening inside the learner's mind.

Constructivism: Based on the premise that we all construct our own perspective of the world, through individual experiences and schema. Constructivism focuses on preparing the learner to problem solve in ambiguous situations (Schuman, 1996).

For a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each of the basic learning theories 

[[Instructional Technology/Learning Theory - Strengths/Weaknesses|Learning Theory - Strengths/Weaknesses]]


=== Contructivist Learning Theory [http://www.cdli.ca/~elmurphy/emurphy/cle2b.html] ===

What we call contructivism is based on the assumption that learning occurs as a result of what learners understand about their world. It is about the individual construction of knowledge. Constructivism is not a learning theory, per se, but rather philosophical approach to teaching and student learning. Constructivist education involves the creation of student-centred learning environments. Teachers adopt strategies and techniques that assist students in constructing knowledge by making links between old and new knowledge and experiences, in recognition that students bring old knowledge and experience to new learning experiences.   

Mental constructs (schema, mental models, etc.) are constructed by past experience, and modified through assimilation and accommodation of new knowledge and experience per the Piagetian framework of thinking about human learning processes. Constructivism, then, is a way of thinking about how we know what we know and understand things; and, a referent for models of instruction and learning (Tobin &amp; Tippin, 1993). In this sense, it is more of a philosphical approach to education which has implications for instructional design and practice.

==Instructional Theory==

Reigeluth (1983) defines Instructional Theory as &quot;identifying methods that will best provide the conditions under which learning goals will most likely be attained.&quot; In other words, the focus on instructional theory is on how to structure instruction and instructional material so it can be learned. Many researchers have contributed to the base of instructional theory, but Robert Gagne is considered the first to have direct connections to instructional technology. His most notable work includes his conditions of learning, nine events of instruction, learning hierarchies and taxonomy of learning objectives, (see [http://chd.gse.gmu.edu/immersion/knowledgebase/theorists/cognitivism/gagne.htm Gagne's Contributions]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructional design is the systematic process of designing, developing, evaluating and managing the entire instructional process to ensure effective and efficient learning. It is based on what we know about instructional and learning theories, systems design, information systems and management (Morrison, Kemp &amp; Ross, 2001). The basic elements of instructional design include:

*Analyze learner and organization needs
*Determine instructional goals and objective
*Construct a method for evaluating learner achievement
*Design and select instructional strategies
*Implement the training
*Evaluate the training


==Origins of Instructional Design==

Instructional design practices and procedures can be traced back to World War II. During the war, a number of psychologists and educators were called on to conduct research and provide training for the military. After the war, many of these individuals continued to work in the field (Reiser &amp; Dempsy, 2002).----


==Instructional Design Models==

Instructional design models help describe the process of how to conduct the various steps of instructional design. They also help us visualize the process and communication with other instructional designers and clients involved in a project. Almost all models of instructional design contain the core elements of analysis, design, develop, implement, and evaluate. This is referred to as the ADDIE model and helps ensure congruence between all phases of instruction. It is often depicted in a step-wise fashion, although it does not necessarily work that way in all cases. Several models for instructional design are described below:

===[[Instructional Technology/Instructional Design/ADDIE|ADDIE]]===

The   ADDIE instructional design model is possibly the best-known instructional design model by Christopher Pappas

The   ADDIE model refers to Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate. Furthermore, provides a step-by-step process that helps instructional designers plan and create training programs with a framework in order to make sure that their instructional products are effective and that their processes are as efficient as they can possibly be.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Analyze&lt;/span&gt;
In the analysis phase, the instructional problem is clarified, the instructional goals and objectives are established, and the learning environment and learner's existing knowledge and skills are identified. Below are some of the questions that are addressed during the analysis phase:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who is the audience and what are their characteristics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did we identify the new behavioral outcome?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What types of learning constraints exist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the delivery options?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the online pedagogical considerations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the timeline for project completion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/span&gt;
The design phase deals with learning objectives, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning, and media selection. The design phase should be systematic and specific. Systematic means a logical, orderly method of identifying, developing, and evaluating a set of planned strategies targeted for attaining the project's goals. Specific means each element of the instructional design plan needs to be executed with attention to details. These are the steps used for the design phase:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Documentation of the project's instructional, visual, and technical design strategy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply instructional strategies according to the intended behavioral outcomes by domain (cognitive, affective, psychomotor).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create storyboards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design the user interface and user experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prototype creation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply visual design (graphic design)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/span&gt;
The development phase is where the developers create and assemble the content assets that were created in the design phase. Programmers work to develop and/or integrate technologies. Testers perform debugging procedures. The project is reviewed and revised according to any feedback given.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;List activities that will help the students learn the task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select the delivery method such as tapes, handouts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review existing material so that we do not reinvent the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop the instructional courseware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synthesize the courseware into a viable training program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Validate the instruction to ensure it accomplishes all goals and objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Implement&lt;/span&gt;
During the implementation phase, a procedure for training the facilitators and the learners is developed. The facilitators' training should cover the course curriculum, learning outcomes, method of delivery, and testing procedures. Preparation of the learners includes training them on new tools (software or hardware), and student registration. This is also the phase where the project manager ensures that the books, hands on equipment, tools, CD-ROMs, and software are in place, and that the learning application or Web site is functional.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;
The evaluation phase consists of two parts: formative and summative. Formative evaluation is present in each stage of the ADDIE process. Summative evaluation consists of tests designed for domain-specific, criterion-related referenced items and providing opportunities for feedback from the users.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review and evaluate each phase (analyze, design, develop, implement) to ensure it is accomplishing what it is supposed to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform external evaluations (e.g. observe that the learner on the job can actually perform the tasks that were trained).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Revise training system to make it better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

===[[Instructional Technology/Instructional Design/Dick &amp; Carey|Dick &amp; Carey]]===

The Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model by Christopher Pappas.

The Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model is based on a reductionist model of breaking instruction down into smaller components. Instruction is specifically targeted on the skills and knowledge to be taught and supplies the appropriate conditions for the learning of these outcomes. Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model is divided into ten sections.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Goals&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the goal of the instruction?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What will the learners  be able to perform after they complete the training program?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Analysis&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the skills that they will be involved to achieve in the desirable goal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Entry Behaviors and Learner Characteristics&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the skills that the learners will bring to the learning task?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Performance Objectives&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we translate the needs and goals into specific and detailed objectives?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Criterion-Referenced Test Items&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the necessary prerequisites for learning new skills?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we check the results of the apprentice learning during the process of the training and at the same time, provide these results to him/her?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Strategy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the instructional activities that we will follow in order to achieve the terminal objectives (exhibition of information, practice, feedback, testing)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Materials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What type of instructional materials we will use (printed, media, both)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Formative Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What data should we revise to improve the instructional materials?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we make instructions as effective as possible for a larger number of learners?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Revise Instruction&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we revise the instruction after the formative evaluation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What were the difficulties for the learners and who will revise them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Summative Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was the system effective as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did the instruction work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did we achieve the desired results?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;References

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What are Learning Objects?==

Design a package of information that can be reused, reconfigured, adaptable to many environments, found whenever needed, and works right out of the box - then you have just designed a reusable learning object.

This is where the majority of the confusion begins. There are many definitions around the idea of what a package of information consists of, which makes up the reusable learning object. Due, in part, to the nature of the object itself, the data required to make it searchable by others (metadata), and varying standards of the creator, reusable learning objects may vary greatly.  

In an attempt to clear up this confusion, definitions were offered to define exactly what a reusable learning object is. As with most things, multiple definitions have been created, each varying slightly. The [http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/mlx/ Maricopa Learning Exchange] defines learning objects as &quot;discreet pieces of content that are electronic, interactive and include a form of assessment that relates to an educational goal.&quot; Cisco Systems, Inc. defines a reusable learning object as a combination of reusable information objects. &quot;An RIO is granular, reusable chunk of information that is media independent.&quot; Cisco Systems, Inc. then goes on to say &quot;individual RIOs are then combined to form a larger structure called a Reusable Learning Object (RLO)&quot; (Cisco Systems Inc., 2000). A third definition is &quot;any entity, digital, or non-digital, which can be used, reused, or referenced during technology-supported learning (Barritt &amp; Alderman, 2004).

Where agreement seems to be shared is in the purpose of a learnign object. Learning objects are instructional units designed to help learners to reach a single instructional objective. This singularity of purpose means that learning objects are self-contained, so a learner does not need supporting information to use a learning object.  

Learning objects are also reusable. This means that a user can access a learning object repeatedly, and that different users can access any learning object as a part of different curriculums, regardless of delivery the method.  Delivery options can include e-learning, intructor-led, a mix of the two, or witten documentation.

Learning objects are searchable. Each learning object is embedded with metadata that describe the subject covered in the learning object. This metadata enables users to easily locate specific learning objects by performing a simple search for a specific subject. 

Learning objects are also known by the following names:

* Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs)
* Educational Objects
* Content Objects
* Training Components
* Nuggets
* Chunks

== Characteristics of Learning Objects ==
{{Wikipedia|Learning management system}}

Barritt and Alderman (2004) identify seven main characteristics each reusable learnign object should have. These are;
**Objective-based - Each should accomplish a single learning objective.
**Context free - Each learning object can stand alone.
**Interactive - Keep the interest of the learner.
**Self-descriptive - Contain enough metadata for successful searching.
**Self-contained - Ability to stand alone or in unison with other objects.
**Single-sourced - Can be used in multiple formats and environments by multiple authors.
**Format free - Formatting the look and feel should be done during delivery.

Wiley (2000) describes three characteristics that define learning objects;
* &quot;Modular digital resources, uniquely identified and metatagged,that can be used to support learning.&quot;
* &quot;Digital resource that can be reused to support learning...&quot;
* &quot;The main idea of 'learning objects' is to break educational content down into small chunks that can be reused in various learning environments, in the spirit of object-oriented programming.&quot;

Attributes of learning objects are further represented with the mnemonic aid, &quot;RAID&quot;.

'''R - '''Reusable&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should have future compatabilities for a longer usable lifetime.

'''A - '''Accessible&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should be easy to locate, access, archive, and reuse.

'''I - '''Interoperable&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should smoothly migrate as platforms evolve.

'''D - '''Durable&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should have a long lifetime of materials.

Learning objects with these attributes have a greater potential for providing the following benefits:
* Benefit education in general
* Expand to use by a larger audience
* Commercial value, i.e. learning objects can be marketed singly or in sets. 

== Using Learning Objects ==
Once you've found the right learning objects, it is vital to understand how to use them effectively to achieve your learning goals and objectives. Finding learning objects to use is one aspect of instructional development, making sure that the learning object is used effectively and appropriately within the course context is another.

An online book that consists of a collection of writings around the instructional use of learning objects can help to connect learning objects to instruction and learning.

[http://reusability.org/read/ '''The Instructional Use of Learning Objects''']is a combination of material from respected authors in the area of instructional objects and theories.

This website also permits visitors to participate in discussions of the book's chapters with the authors and others. Readers may also submit any corrections or errors found in a chapter, or discuss other issues related to learning objects, instruction, and learning.

If these pages have not fully defined what are Learning objects? and you require a different kind of learning strategy,[http://showcase.alivetek.com/learningobjects/gameshow6_TRAIN2.swf click here]to play a game, as presented by Sandy Mills at the 2003 Distance Learning Administration Conference in beautiful Jekyll Island, Georgia, and learn all about learning objects.

== Creating Learning Objects ==

The Cisco System Corporation proposed a four phase system for RLO’s creation.  Each of these phases interacts with each other.  This system has built into it a blend of traditional ISD steps as well as newer computer instructional elements.  The phases were:

*Design- The design phase is where the foundation of the learning event is created.  There are four stages included in this phase:  Needs Assessment, Task Analysis, Learning Objectives, and RLO Types.  When designing learning objects, it is pertinent to consider how many objectives should be included.  If too many are included, the object may become large, which will limit its ability to be reused by other individuals.  

*Develop- The development phase is where text, graphics, video and supporting content are built.  This phase would be complete when alpha, beta testing and review stages are complete.

*Deliver- At the beginning of this phase, the RLO's are complete and produced.  The RLO would be stored in a database and are ready of use.  Packaging of the RLO for delivery to the user must be decided.  Three common types of delivery are:  Dynamic Web Packages, CD-ROM’s, and Instructor-Led Training Materials.

*Evaluate- The evaluation phase is built off of Kirkpatrick’s four levels of evaluation.  According to Cisco using these four levels will allow the author or organization to be able to make judgements about the effectiveness of the RLO.[http://ideal.cecs.missouri.edu/~yliu/learning%20objects/rlo_strategy_v3-1.pdf#search='Reusable%20Learning%20Object%20Strategy']

== Finding Learning Objects ==

Now that you have realized the potential and advantages of Learning Objects, where do you find them?
Learning object discovery may be conducted through a content catalog managed by a learning object repository.

===Metadata===

For learning objects to be used they must be found. It is not easy to find anything in a large distributed online environment like the World Wide Web or a large intranet. The solution is to store not only learning objects but also descriptions of the learning objects. Thinking of the learning objects as data, the descriptions are data about the data, or metadata. Learning object metadata potentially includes information about the title, author, version number, creation date, technical requirements and educational context and intent. Learning Object Metadata is compatible with the metadata used by the digital and online library community. A large amount of metadata can be input for each reusable learnign object, making this task somewhat labor intensive. A balance between inputing enough data to find the object and time spent inputing data is  usually determined by the size and importance of the reusable learning object.

==Shareable Content Objects==
When data characteristics are attached, or associated with a particular Learning Object, it can now become a Shareable Content Object. Also known as a SCO, it is the smallest logical unit of instruction that can be delivered or monitored by a Learning Management System.This attached data is contained in a special file referred to as the manifest file. This file is in a special XML language, that is placed in the top-level directory of a Learning Object and labeled &quot;[[Instructional Technology/Learning Management Systems/Learning Objects|imsmanifest.xml]].&quot; This data or metadata inside the manifest would describes course content and asset meta-data and data that can be maintained on the LMS for and about each student.

Each object should have enough material to be able to function as a stand alone module, without links to supporting material; the sequence in which the SCO appears is controlled through the learner management system. A SCO can conform to any of the more traditional instructional material roles, for example it could be a lesson, a module, a unit of a course, or a learning objective for a lesson. A well constructed SCO might contain all the &quot;assets&quot; needed to present a single lesson or learning objective.

It is shareable because it is usable in more than one course; its content consists of assets, that is the graphics, text or other multimedia that make up a Learning Objective, and it is treated as a single object.

Combine all the attributes of a SCO and what is now created is an object that is compliant with set standards to make it suitable for the acronym described earlier as RAID. The Shareable Content Object is now said to be SCORM compliant.

'''SCORM''' - Shareable Content Object Reference Model are the necessary specifications set-up by the [http://www.adlnet.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=scormabt Advanced Distributed Learning]initiative for improving the education and training of the workforce and the military.

The stated goals for the ADL include:
* providing access to high-quality, tailored education and training materials
* making these materials widely available whenever and wherever they are required
* accelerating large-scale development of learning software
creating a vigorous market for these products

'''The ADL has created its strategy for achieving their SCORM goals by proposing;'''
* to facilitate development of common standards for educational technology
* to pursue emerging network-based technologies 
* to promote widespread collaboration based upon common needs
* to work with industry to influence commercial product development

Because the Learning Object supports the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Instructional_Transaction_Theory_%28ITT%29 instructional transaction theory]of bringing many learning interactions together to acquire a piece of knowledge, many uses can be found throughout education for them such as in; [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Distance_Education distance education], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reusable_Learning_Objects_in_Special_Education special education], and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Project_Based_Learning project based learning]environments.

==Imsmanifest.xml==

Data information containted within a Learning Object has three characteristics that are tracked. Course Description, Course Sequencing, and Course Resources are all placed in a single file called imsmanifest.xml. The imsmanifest.xml file is organized into four sections, the preamble section, the metadata section, the organization section, and the resources section.

* '''Preamble section:'''- This section is virtually the same in every imsmanifest.xml file. This section contains the information used by the LMS.
* '''Metadata section:'''- This section is where the course is described.
* '''Organization section:'''- This section describes the sequencing of the SCOs in the course.
* '''Resources section:''' This section lists all the files that are used with the corresponding SCOs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beginning in the 1950s, the computer industry began using computers to train its own employees. Although able to provide self-paced, individualized instruction with feedback and evaluation, these computer programs were written in technical machine languages of the time, requiring the expertise of experienced computer professionals to design and create them.

With the relatively recent development of more approachable scripting languages such as Perl, ActionScript and JavaScript, it is now possible for instructional designers unskilled in computer programming, per se, to create branched feedback loops, testing modules and employ other methods of information exchange between computers and learners on the Web. In addition, high level authoring systems ease the process of creating interactive Web-based feedback loops, making it possible for them to create interactive Web sites and online instructional software, e.g. Macromedia Dreamweaver, Flash, Authorware, Director and Shockwave. As contemporary learning markets increasingly demand them, publishers are creating online testing and course content modules that compliment required texts as a means to online instruction effecting student learning. Course management and learning management systems are making it increasingly easier to develop large amounts of instruction and instructional material to an international audience.


==Distance Education Defined==
Teaching and learning in which learning normally occurs in a different place from teaching.
Often used interchangeably with distance learning. Typically the learners and instructors are separated by time and place. Interaction must take place through some form of media, such as print (correspondence courses) or electronic (computers). Most distance education courses use a combination of media and technologies.

Distance Education is systematic, planned instruction that is delivered in a manner in which the learner and the instructor are separated by distance and/or time.  The instruction should be hosted by an accredited organization or it can be delivered internally within a company or corporation.  The deliver methods should conform to current technological methods; such as teleconferencing, web-based over the Internet, CD or DVD-ORM disks that are hyperlinked to the Internet.  

This definition is based on a literature search via the Internet, that encompassed several institutions of higher education, including,  [[http://www.holmes.cc.ms.us/elearning/definition.htm Holmes Community College]] in Mississippi, [[http://www.uwex.edu/disted/definition.htm University of Wisconsin-Extension]], [[http://cde.psu.edu/de/what_is_de.html Penn State University]].  The search also included other organizational entities, such as  [[http://www.itcnetwork.org/definition.htm Instructional Technology Council (ITC)]],  and the [[http://www.ncacihe.org/resource/guidelines/gdistance.html Higher Learning Commission]].

The rationale for this definition is that the general consensus among all of the researched definitions, which were organizations within the United States, is that distance education is mainly a geographic separation between the instructor and the learners.  These definitions are a little more inclusive than the European definitions that make a strict requirement on separation by time (and geography).  All of the definitions in the research allowed both asynchronous and synchronous models of distance education.  All of the models allowed two-way video as an acceptable form of distance education.

Distance Education is not a new concept.  It began in the 19th century with [[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Correspondence courses|correspondence courses]].  As time went on technology was a driver of many new forms of distance education. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The major forms of distance education include:&lt;br&gt;
**[[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Correspondence courses|correspondence courses]]
**[[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Broadcast Courses|Broadcast Courses]]
**[[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Compressed Video|Compressed Video]]
**[[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)|Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)]]

== History of Distance Education == 

Distance education offers a second chance at education for people who regret never having finished it. It also offers the flexibility to accommodate individual needs and meet a variety of learning styles and preferences. The earliest form of a distance classroom, an educational experience that separates the instructor and student from each other by distance and time, was paper-based correspondence. Issac Pittman introduced correspondence education in 1840 by sending his students instructions in shorthand through the mail (Curzon, 1977).

This form of distance education was just the beginning of what we are experiencing today. It was an educational experience that, at least part of the time, had the instructor and student at a distance from each other by transformation of the traditional classroom through a different mode. The technology of the time was paper and pen. The technology of today is the computer. “When the computer is used to move beyond traditional classroom walls, opportunities for learning expand. Education is becoming an experience of learning and sharing for students and teachers as a community of learners online [over the Internet]” (Brewer, DeJonge &amp; Stout, 2001, p. 34).
 
With many degrees, programs of study and opportunities for formal and informal education available online, the world of distance education has been transformed by the Internet. While the Web has made it possible for students and teachers to easily access information from their personal computer, it is increasingly used to deliver instructional material and instruction inside and out of the traditional classroom.

Distant learning is becoming a more popular way of learning, than the traditional classroom.  Many people prefere online classes and being able to complete homework on there own time.  It saves them time on the commute there and back everyday.  
Traditional student might find it difficult due to there ability to operate a computer or not having the resources for Internet.  Most people do not own a computer or can afford internet service in there home.  
Most students can adapt to change like online learning, for non traditional students this change might seem overwhelming to learn a new skill.  
Most student may choose to stay in classrooms and have contact with the teacher. Being able to ask questions and find answers in class from teachers or peers is benificial.  With online learning the response time from teacher to student may take longer.   
(Morley, Deborah, Parker, Charles S.&quot;Understanding Computers, Today and Tomorrow&quot;. 2011 p.332)

== K-12 Distance Education ==

Eighty percent of public school districts said that offering courses that are not currently available at their schools is the most important reason for having distance education in their schools. A new report just published by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the first ever to report data on K-12 Distance Education. It shows that about one third of all public school district had students enrolled in distance education courses in the 2002-2003 school year.  In this study, distance education is defined as courses taken for credit and offered to elementary and secondary school students in a school district where the teachers and students are in different locations.

The study found that a greater proportion of districts with students enrolled in distance education courses are located in rural areas (46 percent) than in urban areas (23 percent). 76% of students were in hhgh schools, 15% were in ungraded programs, 7% were in junior high schools, and 2% were in elementary schools.  14% of the total enrollments in distance education in K-12 were in Advanced Placement or college level courses. Distance Education in the K-12 environment has implications for the structure and organization of public education in this country. It moves us closer to the concept of Schools without Walls!
 
The report is titled &quot;Distance Education Courses for Public Elementary and Secondary School Students: 2002-03&quot;
and is available online at: [http://www.nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2005010]

== Principles of Good Online Practice ==

The lack of interactivity was a problem with many early Web designs. Early forms of Web instruction was limited to more or less electronic page turning. Hyperlinks generally didn’t change and they connected static pages that weren’t altered until a site administrator or developer updated the information on specific pages. The underlying problem was that hyperlinked paths through information do not necessarily produce better processing of information in memory or well-constructed personal structures of knowledge. In other words, learning doesn't occur just because the learner clicks on a hyperlink.

Arthur Chickering and Zelda Gamson (March, 1987) identified seven principles that can help improve undergraduate education. Although originally intended to improve teaching and learning of college age students in the traditional classroom, as well as the governance of higher education, this work is considered monumental to the improvement of online instruction. According to Chickering and Gamson, “each practice can stand on its own … together, they employ six powerful forces in education: activity, cooperation, diversity, expectations, interaction and responsibility” (p. 4). In summary, Chickering and Gamson’s principles of good practices in undergraduate education:

#Encourages contacts between students and faculty
#Develops reciprocity and cooperation among students
#Uses active learning techniques
#Gives prompt feedback
#Emphasizes time on task
#Communicates high expectations
#Respects diverse talents and ways of learning

Although Chickering and Gamson’s work came out in the mid-1980s (well before the introduction of online education), its relevance is renewed in light of increased interest in online teaching which has traditionally included presenting new information and then checked to see that learning has occurred. While teaching is principally an interactive process, the Web is historically a “push” technology, used to disseminate information of commercial and even educational value. Chickering and Gameson’s principles are useful in that they point out practices which inform approaches used in online education.

== Distance Education in the Developing World ==

For a long time, developing countries have sent people abroad for university training. These individuals were expected to return to staff universities and government ministries, and serve as conduits of knowledge and skills from the First World to the Third World.  Today, government funding has become more scarce, and university education more expensive. With the endless pressure to, “join the global information economy or perish,” is distance education the best way to train more people, better, and at lower costs? The interplay of technological, pedagogical, cultural, economical, and political factors — at both local and international levels — need to be explored. 

One of the things to keep in mind is that as distance education becomes more widespread and accepted globally, the types and configurations of delivery methods grow proportionately. It is within this diversity that many of the possibilities, stumbling blocks, and solutions for developing countries will be found. 

Developing countries have a rich diversity of university distance education. These institutions are found within single countries, across regions, and between continents. For reasons of cost and infrastructure, television broadcasting and written correspondence remain the preferred delivery method for most. The African Virtual University based in Nairobi, however, is using the Internet and educational software with content in English, French, and Portuguese to train students in a number of countries. 

There are many benefits to be had from distance education in the developing world, but there are also many stumbling blocks that have to be avoided. Apart from infrastructure restraints, there are differences in cultural attitudes toward communications that are becoming increasingly an issue as technologies enter more traditional cultures.

Established social and cultural values also play a key role in the success or failure of distance learning programs. The more “impersonal” computer-based and all asynchronous technologies often clash in traditional societies with cultures that often prefer more “face-to-face” interaction. Many parts of the developing world still retain teaching styles that emphasize rote learning and memorization and involve less independent reading and ensuing critical writing and analysis. How does interactive technology meet this challenge? Is the answer to copy blindly what is being done in the United States? Doing so without taking into consideration economical, social and cultural factors would be a mistake. There should not be just one method of delivery, but maybe a “cocktail of choices” that fits each particular region’s needs. Geography, infrastructure, financing, culture and learning styles will have an impact on what delivery methods should and can be utilized.

Definitions of terminology used in reporting cancer survival statistics. (NOTE: different authors may use varying definitions. Examples of trials using certain definitions are given for the purpose of comparison.)

==Survival statistics==
*'''Overall survival (OS)'''
**From date of diagnosis until death from '''any cause'''. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
*'''Disease-free survival (DFS)'''
**From date of diagnosis until date of first recurrence, locoregional or systemic. All other events were censored. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
**Events are death or recurrence. {{ref|EBMT}} {{ref|Sargent}}
**May also include second primary tumors (NSABP B-04).
**Only includes pts who reached a CR at the end of treatment. {{ref|GELA}}
*'''Local-recurrence-free survival'''
*'''Locoregional recurrence-free survival'''
**1) survival free of an isolated locoregional recurrence at a minimum of 6 months before a systemic event, or 2) survival free of locoregional recurrence occurring at any time before systemic recurrence. Other events were censored. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
*'''Event-free survival'''
**From date of diagnosis until 1) locoregional or systemic recurrence, 2) second malignancy, or 3) death from any cause {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
**1) disease progression or relapse, institution of new unplanned anticancer treatment, or death from any cause {{ref|GELA}}

*'''Disease-specific survival'''
**From diagnosis until death due to the cancer (with or without a prior known date of locoregional or systemic relapse). All other causes of death censored. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
*'''Metastasis-free survival'''
*'''Relapse-free survival (RFS)'''
**Includes any recurrence. Does not include death (i.e., ''deaths are censored''). May also include a contralateral breast cancer that is deemed a recurrence of the primary tumor (NSABP B-04).
*'''Progression-free survival (PFS)'''
**Same as EFS except late deaths not related to cancer or its treatment were excluded. 1) disease progression or relapse, institution of new unplanned anticancer treatment, or death related to disease {{ref|GELA}}

*'''Systemic disease-free survival'''
**From date of diagnosis until date of first systemic recurrence, including: 1) systemic recurrence outside the locoregional area at any time before or after locoregional relapse, 2) systemic recurrence with or without locoregional relapse, or 3) death from cancer with no information on systemic recurrence. (All other causes of death were censored.) {{ref|BritishColumbia}}

*'''Freedom from progression (FFP)'''
**Until first treatment failure. Includes failure to achieve CR (as opposed to RFS). Does not include deaths. {{ref|MilanHD}} {{ref|EORTC_H3}}

==Tumor response==
*CR - complete response 
**CRu - complete response (undocumented)
*PR - partial response
*Stable disease
*Progressive disease

*'''RECIST''' criteria (2000) - Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
**Response is defined as a 30% decrease in the largest diameter instead of 50% decrease in bidimensional measurements. (0.7 * 0.7 is close to 0.50)

*'''RECIST 1.1''' criteria (2009) - Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Updated and Clarified
**HIGHLIGHTS OF REVISED RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions required to be assess tumor burden for response determination has been reduced from a max of 10 to a max of 5 total. Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated such that nodes with a short axis of 15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to &lt;10mm short axis are considered normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum, a 5mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression' of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions.

''Please see [[Wikijunior:Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] for an alternate version of this module.''
----

Do you know your weight in kilograms or pounds? On Earth, your weight is a number. If you are heavier, then this number is larger. If you go to the moon, or to a space station, is this number the same? Some people say that it is the same, and some people say that it is different. To understand why, you need to know about '''gravity, mass, and weight'''.

=== Mass ===
Like many words, the word ''weight'' can have several different meanings. One meaning of weight is called ''mass''. The word &quot;mass&quot; is used in astronomy and other parts of science.

The mass of an object is simply the amount of material the object is made of. The more material the object is made of, the more mass it has. Things that have a big mass are harder to move and harder to stop than objects with just a little bit of mass. So an empty box (with only air inside) is easier to move than a box filled with books. The box with books has more material, and so more mass, than the empty box.

Our mass is a number for how much stuff there is in our body. That is, if we grow, adding more cells to our body, or retaining more body fat or increasing how big our muscles are, our mass will increase; the number for your mass becomes larger. If we start a diet, and reduce how much fat is kept by our body, the number for our mass becomes smaller. In countries that use the metric system, also called the &quot;Le Système International d'Unités&quot; or SI, the units of mass used for the weight of people is often ''kilograms'' (kg).

Suppose that a child has a mass of 40 kg.
Now suppose the child goes to the moon or to a space station, but does not change in body composition. Then the number for how much stuff the body has does not change. The child's mass on the moon or at a space station is 40 kg. 

Our mass on any planet on the solar system (Jupiter, Venus, Earth, or anywhere else) is the same. But if we step on a scale, the reading will be different on all of these planets, because a scale measures weight, not mass, and weight depends on gravity as well as on mass.

=== Gravity ===
There is another meaning of weight, called &quot;force of gravity&quot;. The word &quot;weight&quot; can mean one of two things, &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;force of gravity&quot;. But what is &quot;gravity&quot;?

Suppose we jump into the air. We cannot fly, but instead we fall and land on the ground. There is a ''force'' which pulls us to the ground. This force is called ''gravity''. The Earth makes gravity, so every time that we jump, we will land on Earth again, because the Earth's gravity pulls us, and we are not strong enough to jump fast enough to escape that gravity.

Which objects make gravity? To make significant gravity, an object must have a very large number for mass. A child may only be 40 kg. The Earth's mass is about 6 million billion billion kg. (That's six followed by twenty-four zeros). The Earth has enough mass to make us fall, as quickly as we do, when we jump.

All things with mass make gravity and attract one another. The more mass an object has, the more it attracts other objects toward it. So while the Earth pulls on a child, the child also pulls on the Earth. The force on the child is the same as the force on the earth. Because the earth is so massive, that force moves it very little. If we could look very closely, though, we would see that when the child jumps, the Earth is pushed away by the force of the child's legs, a very small distance, mostly it's the child who moves. And then, when the child falls, the Earth also &quot;falls&quot; just a little bit toward the child.

Everything with mass makes gravity. When we are on Earth, the moon, the other planets, and the sun are far away, and the force of gravity gets smaller with distance, so we land on Earth again. (Gravity pulls us towards the center of any massive object. Because we are so close to the center of the Earth, compared to the center of other planets and the Sun, we are mostly pulled toward the center of the Earth when we are on the Earth. Gravity would pull us towards the center of the Venus, or any planet, if we were on the Venus or another planet.)

Suppose we went to the moon. Now the Earth is too far away to have much effect on how we would fall. If we jump from the moon, we will land on the moon again. The mass of the moon is about 70 thousand billion billion kg. This is much less than the mass of the Earth, 81 Moons would have as much mass as the Earth.

The force of gravity varies directly with the two masses that we consider, multiplied together. If we are jumping on the moon, our mass would be the same as on the Earth, but the mass of the Earth is 81 times that of the Moon, so the attractive force, if we were at the same distance from the center of the Earth or Moon, would be 1/81 as great for the Moon as for the Earth. Because the Moon is smaller, though, we are closer to the center, and the gravity on the Moon's surface is about one sixth that of the gravity on the surface of the Earth.

To describe how gravity changes with distance is a little more complicated. If we divide the distance by two, we will increase the force by two times two, or four. That's said this way: &quot;The force of gravity varies with the inverse square of the distance.&quot; When the distance is large, a little change in distance makes almost no change in the force of gravity, but the change in gravity from moving from a beach near the ocean to the top of a mountain can be measured. It's not enough to notice just from how it feels to jump!

=== Force ===
Gravity exerts a force and that force may be measured in units called &quot;newtons.&quot; The force on a mass exerted by gravity will vary with the mass and how strong the gravity is where the mass is located. If we double the mass we will double the force.

However, when we push on an object that is free to move, that object will start to move in the direction we push. How fast it moves depends on three things: how hard we push, the mass of the object, and how long we push.

The more massive the object, the slower will be its response to our pushing. The result is that, although the force of gravity increases with mass, the motion decreases with mass, and these two effects cancel each other out.

So how fast things fall doesn't change with the mass. However, other things may change it, especially friction or air resistance.

A cannonball is pulled more strongly by gravity than a ball-bearing, but it has more mass and takes more effort to start moving. A ball-bearing has less mass, but takes less effort to start moving. Both then take the same amount of time to roll down a ramp, and perhaps you have seen or will see a demonstration of something like this.

Why, then, does something like a feather or piece of paper take so much longer to fall to the ground than a cannonball? This is because the ''resistance'' from the air in which they are falling is much greater for the feather or paper than for the cannonball. The resistance is a force opposite in direction to the motion, so it reduces the net force on the object.

(Gravity is always attracting us to the center of the Earth. Even when we are standing on the ground. The ground ''resists'' the force of gravity, pushing back up with an equal and opposite force, so we stay put.)

What happens, then, if there is no air? In 1971, astronaut David Scott visited the Moon, where there is no air. He held a feather and hammer, each in one hand, and then dropped them at the same time. They both hit the surface of the moon, also at the same time.

=== A table showing how gravity changes what happens elsewhere ===

If we were able to travel to another world, like the astronauts of the Apollo lunar exploration crews, there are a number of things that we would notice that are different from what you would experience on the Earth.  There are also some things that would be just the same.

The following is a table regarding what kinds of experiences, if we weigh 40 kg. on Earth, would have if we visited different planets or moons in the Solar System:

&lt;center&gt;
{| width=&quot;65%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|- 
! !! Earth !! Moon !! Mercury !! Venus !! Mars !! Phobos 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Surface Gravity (compared to Earth = 1000 milli-g)
| 1000 ||  170 || 380 || 900 || 380 || 5 (average)
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Our weight (mass)
| 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!How much we could lift
| 10 kg || 59 kg || 26 kg || 11 kg || 26 kg || 2000 kg 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!How high we could jump
| 20 cm || 120 cm || 53 cm || 22 cm || 53 cm || 400 m
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Time to fall back to ground (seconds)
| 0.4 || 2.4 || 1.1 || 0.4 || 1.1 || 380
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!How far we could kick a ball
| 20 m || 120 m || 53 m || 22m || 53 m || (into Martian orbit)
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In a pressurized chamber like a huge domed city, on the Moon, we would be able to put on wings and flap our arms to fly like birds do here on the Earth.  Human powered flight is almost impossible here on the Earth because humans weigh too much here.

Phobos is one of the moons of Mars, and is so tiny that the gravity is very low.  For example, if we kicked a ball really hard it could leave Phobos completely and go into orbit as a separate object orbiting Mars.  Jumping up would take several minutes before the gravity would pull us back down, so we could jump over a mountain on that moon of Mars if we wanted to.

Of all the objects in the Solar System with a &quot;solid&quot; surface that we could walk on, the Earth has the strongest gravity.  Jupiter and Saturn may have stronger gravity, but there is nothing we can say is a &quot;solid&quot; surface to walk on.  There may be planets that are larger than the Earth with a solid surface, but they are not found in our Solar System. (However, if there were a floating platform on Jupiter or Saturn, we could walk on it, but it would be difficult, we'd weigh so much.)

If you're new to the Blender, do you find this exercise useful?  Please let me know, thank you.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 14:20, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)


I thought your explanation was clear and concise. --marytee

I found it useful, helps understanding of what's going on with mesh modeling :) --rushton

Very useful piece, made the differences between edge/face/vertex quite clear. --adam

Couldn't have been better.  It gives a very good idea of how 3D modeling works for someone who has little knowledge of it.  --matt

== Important difference in who you want to reach ==

Okay, I must say that I found this very interesting. I can accept that some people won't get the explanation because there aren't any images with it. You might put a few images as a reference, at then end or the beginning of this document. Only there, I believe it would interfere with this perfectly written text otherwise.

What I also think, is that you ask your question a little bit vague.
I am a semi-n00b to rendering, I'm a student in architecture, so I know programs like sketchup etc.  And out of personal interest I too, know programs like Cinema4D, VectorWorks &amp; some Bentley systems programs (just basic introductions to them, I have had).

It is boring as hell for those who know it, and rather difficult to understand for those who know nothing about it, they don't have time to put in their heads ;-).

But, I must say, that is written very well, and for me, it was plain old perfect :-D


thank for the tut btw


MADnificent (at gmail.com)


--I've been rendering for a good few years in 3ds max now, and I'm looking at Blender to teach as a free alternative. I think your explanation is excellent, I'll probably be using it to demonstrate principles to students some time soon.  --Will S

++I think that this exercise is useful for remembering how a model is built up it is quite helpful - even if I already knew some of it!

Thanks for the excellent Tutorial.

--Joel

== Simple and concise ==

This is a good concise explanation of Mesh Modeling

== Great Tutorial ==

Very easy to follow.

--Ummon

== Plural of vertex ==
While the Webster certainly knows ''vertices'' as plural of ''vertex'', it also (and firstly) mentions ''vertexes''.


---------------------------------------
The commonly used mathematical term for the plural of vertex is vertices.

--Ummon

== 3 dots 'roughly in the shape of a triangle' ==

What does this mean? Unless they are collinear, 3 dots define a non-degenerate triangle. Does it mean equilateral triangle?

--Ummon


It is most likely there to make sure no one puts the dots in a straight line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian Cuisine]]

The [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian]] version of the Goulash [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] is an easy to prepare, inexpensive, tasty and filling
dish well suited for cold winter days. This thick, sweet-spicy soup of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hungary|Hungarian]] origin is served in inns and restaurants across Austria. 

The key ingredient for goulash soup is a good quantity of sweet [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] powder. 
It is important not to use hot paprika, the red powder sold simply as &quot;paprika&quot; in most supermarkets, as this
would make the soup too spicy and of the wrong consistency. 
Sweet paprika can be obtained from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] or central [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] delis and specialist supermarkets. It is normally sold in 250 [[Cookbook:g|g]] sachets.  
For the authentic taste, the [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seeds]] and [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] are indispensable. [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]] and tomato puree can be
left out if unavailable. 

==Ingredients==
 
* 500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] lean [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 3 tbsp powdered ''sweet [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]'' 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] powdered ''hot paprika''
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seeds]] (''not'' cumin)
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] (fresh or dried)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] (fresh or dried)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] [[Cookbook:Puree|puree]]
* 50 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:l|l]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] or 2 stock cubes dissolved in 1 l of water. 
* [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==

#Cut the beef and potatoes into 1.5 [[Cookbook:cm|cm]] cubes. Cut the caraway seeds into rough chunks with a kitchen knife. Chop onions into thin slices. Warm the beef stock.
#Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a cooking pan to medium/high heat. [[Cookbook:Fry|Fry]] the beef cubes until medium brown and crispy, remove and drain on a kitchen towel.
#Turn to medium heat. Add another tbsp of vegetable oil and roast the caraway seeds for 1 min. Add the onions and turn to low heat. Gently roast the onions until they turn yellowish. 
#Add the beef cubes and roast for another 2 min. Slowly add the vinegar, beef stock, potatoes and tomato puree. Add the sweet paprika and stir well to disperse clumps.
#Season with marjoram, thyme, hot paprika, the bay leaf and a pinch of black pepper. [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] for 30 min.

==Variations==

#Garnish each dish with a tbsp of [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] or ''[[Cookbook:Creme Fraiche|creme fraiche]]'' and sprinkle with freshly cut [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]] before serving.
#Add 100 ml of [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]]  after frying beef/onions.
#For a more nutritious meal, fry 2 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]], 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and 1 [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] (all chopped) with the onions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Right now we should be looking at topology of this document. I don't think the structure is mature enough to start throwing a lot of content into it.

Agreed, but the 'what is a reef aquarium' is good as a first section. I think content can start to be added here. I'll prime it with a basic definition first.--[[User:ChrisJMoor|ChrisJMoor]] 00:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

I've started adding more information to this book. 

Marine Science 101 should not be very in depth, but should cover some of the basic ideas that relate to fishkeeping so that you have a bit of scientific understanding of why you shouldn't overcrowd, or what's in the water and what don't you want in it, and other things of that nature. Purely introductory level, but I believe that it is important to give aquarists this kind of background knowledge. 

BTW, as I go through this, there are many places where I have little experience, so as I edit there will be some parts that should still be fleshed out by others. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 04:27, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

I changed it to Marine Aquaria because I believe that Reef aquaria, although an important subset, excludes other smaller topics that are not extremely different. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 13:02, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

{{recipesummary|Louisiana recipes|3|1 hour|2|Image=[[Image:Jambalaya.JPG|300px]]}}

'''Jambalaya''', one of [[wikipedia:Louisiana|Louisiana's]] most famous dishes, is rooted in [[wikipedia:Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[wikipedia:French cuisine|French]] cuisine and is the [[wikipedia:New World|New World]] version of [[cookbook:paella recipes|paella]].

Jambalaya originated in the [[wikipedia:French Quarter|French Quarter]] of [[wikipedia:New Orleans|New Orleans]]. It was the accidental result of Spaniards attempting to make paella in the New World where [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]] was not readily available due to import costs. Consequently, tomatoes became the substitute for saffron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crawfish.com/crawfish-jambalaya.php &quot;Crawfish And Tasso Jambalaya.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As time went on, French influence became strong in New Orleans, and spices from the [[wikipedia:Caribbean|Caribbean]] changed this New World paella into a unique dish. In modern Louisiana, the dish has evolved into many variations but primarily there are two types of Jambalaya: Creole and Cajun. 

Creole Jambalaya, also called red Jambalaya, is found primarily in and around New Orleans and is made with tomatoes which make it red.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elook.org/recipes/american/510.html Creole Jambalaya recipe]&lt;/ref&gt; Cajun Jambalaya, which has no tomatoes, originated in Louisiana's rural, low-lying swamp country. It has a distinct smokey flavor and brown color, the result of browning the meat in a cast iron pot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/throwdown-with-bobby-flay/cajun-chicken-and-sausage-jambalaya-recipe/index.html Cajun Jambalaya recipe]&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions can contain virtually any kind of meat and/or seafood but [[wikipedia:crayfish|crayfish]] (called crawfish in Louisiana) is a popular inclusion.

This famous dish is surprisingly simple to prepare and works well as an everyday meal. The below Creole Jambalaya recipe includes [[Cookbook:Meat_and_poultry#Poultry|poultry]] and [[Cookbook:Tomato|canned tomatoes]].

==Ingredients==
* 1/3 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 14.5 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (411[[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, diced or torn apart
* 1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|broth]]
* 2 cups cooked and chopped [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 1.5 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 drained small can of sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (optional)

==Procedure==
{{wikipedia|Jambalaya}}
#Mix the salt and unground spices (bay leaf excepted) together, then grind them.
#Prepare the canned tomatoes: tear them up, remove the stem ends, remove the seeds, etc. '''Keep the juice.'''
#Select a wide pan with a lid.
#Lightly [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the celery in the butter. Soften the celery but do not brown it.
#Add everything to the pan. You can add the basil, meat and mushrooms later if you prefer.
#Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]], then cover and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for about 20 minutes. The rice will absorb the liquid.
#Discard the bay leaf.

{{spice}}

'''Bay leaves''' are the aromatic leaves of several species of the laurel family. They are used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance, and may be used fresh or dried.

'''Mediterranean bay leaf'''
: The leaf of the bay laurel or &quot;true laurel&quot;, Laurus nobilis, is a culinary herb often used to flavor soups, stews, and braises and pâtés in Mediterranean Cuisine.
'''California bay leaf'''
:The leaf of the California bay tree also known as 'California laurel', 'Oregon myrtle', and 'pepperwood', is similar to the Mediterranean bay, but has a stronger flavor.
'''Indian bay leaf (Tej pat)'''
:The leaf of the Cinnamomum tejpata tree, similar in fragrance and taste to cinnamon bark, but milder. In appearance, it is similar to the other bay leaves, but is culinary quite different.
'''Indonesian bay leaf (Daun Salam)'''
:The dried leaf of the Eugenia polyantha Wight plant of the Myrtaceae family.  There is no good substitute for this leaf in cooking.  Daun Salam is Indonesian for Peace Leaf.

      <comment>/* Arteriosclerosis */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike Allopathic Medicine Homeopathy does not advise the use of Specific medicine for diseases,however in this section medicines are arranged under disease headings for brevity and ease of understanding.

==Adenoids==
Calcium phosphate (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the prime Homeopathic medicine for the treatment of Adenoids. Another remedy used by the old German doctors was calcium iodide (CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Both of these medicines are given in lower potencies especially '''6X'''. When Adenoids occur following vaccination the indicated medicine is '''Thuja''' in high potencies. A common strategy is to give calcium phosphate or 4 tablets twice daily and ''Thuja'' twice weekly.

==Anemia==
Schuessler recommends the use of calcium phosphate for Green sickness in young girls.Vineger, Pickles, And Lemons should be proscribed if their use in subjects is very high.

In persons lacking intellect can try Baryta Carb 200 once a day but in homoeopathy totality of symptoms count so it is advisible to take proper Homoeopathic consultation.

==Arteriosclerosis==
Homeopaths believe that the common milk thistle (''Silybum marianum''), which they call '''Carduus Marianus''', can cure arteriosclerosis. The dose is 5 drops of Tincture thrice daily. Free use of Olive oil should be encouraged in such patients.
The most effective to remove blockages of the arteries has been and still is Crataegus Q, taking several drops, 3 to 5 times daily over at least 6 months.
another remadies baryta muriaticum and baryta carbonica(both in 30 and 200 potencies) are nearly specific for this condition especially in eiderly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Never Used a Computer ==

I've moved this back here. This book is about flat-out basics for absolute beginners. For a more specific tutorial on Windows XP, I've left the
book Windows XP for Beginners as a separate project. -- [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 23:34, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 

As a passing comment, it may be worthwhile to have a section on how to explore in a computer. In the limited sample of my family members and friends, those that are computer illiterate are most afraid of breaking the computer, which makes them afraid to try out new things. I'd argue that the ability to explore a computer on your own is a key skill to get anywhere in using a computer. The section could have some info like what is safe to do, what you should avoid doing, ways to try out things if you don't know what they do, etc.

--[[User:Naerbnic|Naerbnic]] 21:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Help my bewk. We could be 1337 together. ^_^;;
--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 04:02, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Naerbnic - That's a great idea. I'll try to fit it in somewhere sometime.
Cyberman - I'm kind of busy with my book, but I'll check yours out and see if I can add anything. By the way, I know nothing about A+ cerfification. :-)

--[[User:Kram|Kram]] 23:05, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I wrote a bit on web browsing, but there is a paradox here. If the poor computer-illiterate doesn't even know how to browse the web, how are they even reading this book anyway?! I think wikibooks really needs an easy way to export PDFs or something, books like this one can be printed and given out to under-developed countries etc.

--[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 18:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

First of all Sideris, you should move your bit on web browsing to the actual chapter instead of the TOC. Also, I copied the text from the website, put it in OOo Writer, and exported it as a pdf. This worked okay, but it would be better if there was a program that would take the source for the wikibook and make a pdf out of it.

--[[User:Kram|Kram]] 17:09, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes, sorry I put it in the TOC, it was a moment of confusion :-) I will move it when I find some free time. About printing: it is easy to print one-page articles from wikipedia in the way you described, but the structure that wikibooks follow would make printing one whole wikibook very tedious. You need a program for that (and again, if I find the time, I'll sit down and write it myself!)

--[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 11:54, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Paradox ==

I agree with kram that there is a paradox here - how can a person who doesn't &quot;know how to move a mouse&quot; browse through this?

==Windows XP for Beginners==

I moved this here because: almost all new computer users will have Windows XP, it is impossible to accurately teach several operating systems, and it's almost all Windows XP stuff anyway.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:12, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Also, do you really think that anyone who is new to computers would use Linux, I mean, come on, get serious- new users dont go out and buy Linux, period.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:19, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::They don't go out and buy ''any'' OS, period. They do get Linux on the $199 Walmart computers though, and they get MacOS X on Macs.

::Okay, smartguy, yes, they do buy an OS sometimes, but no, not when getting a computer.  And no one who buys that $199 computer with linux will be happy they did-they are bad for new users, ''period''.  And there's a reason you never see ''REAL'' books about all kinds of different OS's, for instance, ''maybe'' you might see Mac OS X and Windows, but you can't describe how to use the trillion plus linux os's in one book (well, since they all are just Windows 98-GUI clones, maybe you can).--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't see why you think so. Maybe ''you'' would not like a Linux computer. Somebody expecting to run a particular Windows-only game will of course be unhappy. The modern Linux box can do all the basic grandma tasks though. If you're thinking about the command line (like a fancy DOS box, ugh), you haven't seen a modern end-user-oriented Linux distribution.

:::It may be news to you, but many people only use the web browser. Consider that this provides email access, online tax prep, all the forums one could want, flash-based games for the grandkids, wikipedia, and so on. Linux boxes even continue functioning long after they are purchased, while Windows boxes are often replaced because of spyware-related slowdowns and crashes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:19, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'm okay with the name change, but there is some Linux information in the book already. Should it be removed? --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 21:01, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:If this book aims to about Windows XP, then anything not about windows xp should not be here. So I deleted a section on creating symbolic links in linux. Delete any more if you find 'em. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:48, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

At least until someone creates a [[Linux for Beginners]].  I'm sorry I changed it without saying anything, but to me it just seemed common sense.  If I offended someone, I'm sorry.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)


I don't think the change by [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] was a good idea.  I would like to change it back to ''Never Used a Computer''.
Here is why:

* Windows XP will be obsolete in a few years. It would be nice to make this book a bit more generic and future proof.

* This books includes info about hardware, as it should. Absolute beginners need to be informed about hardware just as much as software. They also find it hard to distinguish between hardware and software, so both should be included in the same book.

* There is a lot more to computers than just the operating system. The info on the internet is totally independent of the operating system.

*  Naryathegreat says it is impossible to accurately teach several operating systems. As the original name implied, the book is meant for absolute square-one beginners. They don't need to be taught ''accurately'' about any operating system. They only need to  know the very basics, which are similar enough for XP, Linux and MacOS.  It is not hard to include supplementary info where there are differences. Why do we need to exclude non-Windows users categorically if they can be catered for with little effort?

* Naryathegreat says almost all new computer users will have Windows XP. What he has failed to ask is whether people reading ''this'' book will have Windows XP. People in developing nations will find this book more useful than people in the West who can afford tutorials. We should also aim this book at the vast population in developing nations purchasing the &quot;100 dollar PC&quot; over the next few years, most likely a Linux PC.

* Naryathegreat says it's almost all Windows XP stuff anyway. Not it's not. There is a large section on hardware and the internet in general, and some users are already trying to delete the section because of the name. 

I have nothing against a book called ''Windows XP for Beginners and Intermediates'' but this does not seem to be the intention of this book.
-- [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 18:33, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==

Hi there, you have a nice book that grows well. I'd like to suggest two things: 
# On the main page, you don't have to put links to subpages into &lt;nowiki&gt;[[sections]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It just invites people to click on the &quot;edit&quot; button to the right and put their information to the wrong place, and you have to write this &quot;If you want to add stuff, click on the chapter please!&quot; line, which, frankly, I have not seen on other Wikibooks. Why? Because they don't use headings for links. Have a look at these simple examples: [[Hamster Care]], [[How To Build A Computer]], [[CPAM with TWW]], ...
# There are several ways to organize books (see the current discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]), but I would recommend you to change to a more standardized delimiter, using either &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. The latter (subpages via &quot;/&quot;) will give you the additional benefit of an autmatic link back to the main page of your book. Your subpages would then be organized as
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Introduction]]
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Buying A Computer]]
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Flat Out Basics]]
and so on. (You can move pages easily with the &quot;move&quot; command on top of the page, once you are logged in). If you need any help or advice, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:05, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Thanks Andreas, I think I'll fix the layout right now. --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 15:53, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:On the [[How To Build A Computer]] wikibook, we have a simplified TOC, then a link to the more complete TOC. I think that would be a good idea for this book too. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:43, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Removal of Computer Buying 101 Chapter ==

Since it's about XP, and not Computer Buying 101, I believe the &quot;Buying a Computer&quot; section isn't really appropriate for this book. --icez

This book was originally for people who never used a computer. [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] then insisted on calling it Windows XP for Beginners.
I do think it is appropriate to include hardware because a) beginners find it hard to distingush between hardware and software b) beginners will
find the information very useful. [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 17:56, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

{{equipment}}

A '''mandoline''' is a device for making even slices.
It is composed of a fixed, horizontal, blade mounted slightly above a platform.  Food is slid across the platform, and a slice is removed from the bottom.
Higher-quality mandolines have adjustable cutting thicknesses, and/or interchangeable blades for [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienne]] or waffle cut.

Mandolines (or their close cousins, the &quot;V&quot;-slicer and mandolin) are the most efficient manual method to slice large quantities of firm vegetables - such as potatoes, squash, yams, or carrots - into regular pieces. Some brands come with vertical blades as well for cutting French fries or julienne strips.


==Warning==
Mandolines (or their close cousins, the &quot;V&quot;-slicer and mandolin) are the most efficient manual method to slice your hand. Higher-quality mandolines allow for adjustable injury.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi
I'm trying to find out if deep-frying will leach beneficial oil out of fish?

:Coat the fish, as in the [[Cookbook:Fried Fish|Fried Fish]] recipe, and there's no way the fish oils could leak out. Uncoated fish would probably fall apart anyway.


---
In regards to the food poisoning: If you let bacteria/organisms grow in the oil, and then you heat the oil to over 300 degrees farenheit, won't that kill/neutralize all the dangerous organisms?
-Chris W.

:My understanding is that the primary concern is with the breakdown of the oil more than with bacterial growth. However, oil reuse is the norm; you can detect rancid oil quite easily by smell, and just discard it when that time comes. To prevent rancidity, filter the oil before storage. I'm looking for hard sources on this, though, before putting it out there as more than just one of several sides of the argument.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=discuss!=
The link to the Blender 2.3 book is pointing to the store. But that book has been made available online Ref: http://www.blender.org/cms/Documentation.628.0.html. But I am wondering whether the link should be left as such considering the few bucks the blender foundation could potentially gain. I surely want to help these guys for producing the terrific software. But I can't right now. Hence this dilemma.


I just updated the link to the Windows installer, but should we even be linking directly to the files on this page? Maybe it shoud just link directly to the download page? -- Shawn Fumo

Blender runs really slowly for me even though I have a revelitivly fast computer. Is it because I dont have Python instaled or somthing else?

      <text xml:space="preserve">I had to look for a while to find the set smooth button, it would be nice to give a description of where it is such as &quot;in the 'Link and Materials' group of the button window.&quot; --Kevin

When I use the setsurf command only the lower part of the first created leg is smoothed out -- I feel as though I followed the instructions well to this point so I'm a bit puzzled.  --Travis

====Annoyances==

My mans head appears to be a seperate entity from the model itself. How do I merge it with the model so I can proceed? I succeeded once, but the guy just turned into circles and wouldn't turn into one smoothed surface like it should.


== A Strange Error... ==

When I used the setsurf, I had two small problems.  My model had a bump on its arm, which I realized was caused by some extra edges that had somehow been accidentaly created and become attached, and were warping the arm out of shape.  That was easy to fix - I jsut deleted the edges.  But I've also had another problem I haven't been able to solve yet - one of the arms didn't become rounded - it just ends in a flat circle, although the edge is smoothed.  Does anyone have any idea why this could have happened, or what I can do about it?  I know it's not that important, but now I'm curious! [[User:Oracleoftruth|Oracleoftruth]] 05:56, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)


== Possible Solution... ==

My hunch is the same thing that I did in error -- you need to make sure that when you're extruding that you actually select all four vertices.  If you keep the view in the front view and select the two visible vertices you aren't extruding the region.  You'll know if you're extruding correctly if the option box asks what you want to extrude -- it needs to have the &quot;region&quot; option in there.  Rotate your view and be sure to select all four vertices -- using shift+R.click if you have to.  That was my error at least.   - Travis June 9th, 2005

:That seemed to work, although that wasn't exactly the problem I was having!  Anyways, my person now has lovely round arms, so all is well.  Thanks. --Oracleoftruth 17:12, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

== umm my whole guy turns to circles ==

Ok so I sub surface and my whole guy turns to circles sorry for spelling 2:00am.....oh and I selected nothing and same result...also i tryed selecting the head and body...Same thing....And then the head alone....still the same thing lol...... but all the same results, so what do i do!
thanks a bunch 

David.S

P.S ausome Tut so far

: Weellll...  it sounds like it's working!  When you turn on subsurfs, he should no longer be blocky, but rounded, like in the pictures provided.  Your draw mode might need to be changed; try hitting the ZKEY to see if that makes things a little better for you.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:33, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

nope it all turns to blocks to sphere and the head gets smother
thanks David.S

: That's what it's supposed to be doing.  Post a screenshot if you're in doubt.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:30, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

I've had this problem with the faces turning into circles. I pressed exclude doubles and the problem solved

Where is exclude doubles???

== I have same circleproblem ==

Guy turns in separate circles. Does anybody know why?

Similar problem here. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to merge several shapes together to make a single object. On the extrude, I somehow ended up with small gaps between the squares, although I did end up extruding off of the whole object instead of the face (trying a different, yet similar simple shape). If there's some way to merge several objects into one for the purposes of the subsurf, here would be a great place to add it or link to it.

== Optimal Draw button ==

The paragraph discussing &quot;Optimal Draw&quot; is confusing.  It seems to mix discussion of Optimal Draw with the Apply button.

Also, in Blender 2.42a, &quot;Optimal Draw&quot; is now a bar just below &quot;Render Levels&quot; in the Subsurf part of the Modifiers tab.


== Can't find subsurf button ==

I have no subsurf button in my mesh buttons panel. I see Auto Smooth, Degr: 30, TexMesh:, Centre, Centre New, Centre Cursor, etc. Am I lookin in the right place? I'm using a 2.40 alpha release.

* I have the same problem. i think its just because we're using the newer release. if i figure out how to do this in the newer release i will add it in.

Guys I figured it out, All You have to do is type in Shift+The letter &quot;o&quot;.
and thats it then your subsurf button will appear.
Hope that helps it sure helped me! peace, printf(&quot;Joker:)&quot;);

You have to click on &quot;Add Modifier&quot; in the &quot;Modifiers&quot; panel. Then click subsurf.

== Yet Another Strange Error ==

Well, my guy looks odd : only the last built cube (right &quot;foot&quot;) is &quot;subsurfed&quot; (no pb with the head thought, previously sphered with no pb). I have no doubles, tried to select all the cubes etc... all I got is quite a loosy pirate :/

please help, I want a ninja !

-- idDxD (Jan 19 2006)

solved, had too much duplicated verticles.. but smoothing is very shy, rounds hardly the edges, and not the extremities

== Solution if some sides don't get rounded == 

Somewhat later in the tutorial (with the hat), you use Remove Doubles.  This button is called &quot;Rem Doubles&quot;, and it's in the Mesh Tools tab.  Turns out, a lot of the &quot;why isn't this side rounded&quot; problems are a result of extra vertices that you can't see!  So click that button.  I tried it with the sample file you can download (which had a couple of face-not-rounded errors) and it fixed it up!  Hope that helps.  --[[User:Nanodeath|Nanodeath]] 22:53, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
---- I had trouble when I had not extended all the vertices of the cube. I had to switch to different views to find and select those vertices. Then in the menu that pops up I had to select region i.e. to extend the whole selected region. Thanks Vinod Isaac [http://vinodisaac.com Vinod Isaac's Home Page]

== Fix page please? ==

The page seems extremely messy, like it's been drawn all over with slight comments. Could it be cleaned up by someone with exprience please? I'm finding it difficult to follow because comments like &quot;in latest versions try X Y Z&quot;, when I've just tried Y Z. Wouldn't it be best to just assume people are using the latest version?

== Set Smooth Error ==

I'm having an odd error when I press &quot;Set Smooth&quot;. Everything looks okay, but some odd triangles are appearing on my figure's head. Here's a 
[http://www.box.net/shared/0nq7ly9udm screenshot] (Download it, don't click preview).
Interestingly, when I render it, it's fine. Any ideas?

==No Boxy Cage?==
For some reason when I'm in edit mode there's no box cage around my subsurfed model. Just a bunch of new edges, which I think would make the next tutorial rather difficult. I tried playing around with a few things in the subsurf menu to see if that changed anything, but nothing seems to work. I'm using ver 2.49b if that makes any difference. To be more specific, if I switch bewteen edit and object mode before I hit &quot;apply&quot; it has the boxy cage, but as soon as I hit &quot;apply&quot; it goes away. Clicking the little circle button mentioned in the tutorial makes no difference either way. Is it a setting I may have accidentally changed?

== Optimal Draw ==
I too have the same problem as the one described in &quot;Set Smooth Error&quot;. I believe it might be related to the fact that I haven't selected the Optimal Draw button. Where can I &lt;u&gt;find this button&lt;/u&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Blender 2.57&lt;/b&gt;? (Thanks for the help).

== Is there a step missing between the last module and this one? ==

At the end of the last module, the simple man has 3 cubes extruded out as each arm. However, the image in this module seems to have five cubes extended out as each arm though there is no step that asks us to add more cubes. Its fine for this module, but in the next module, while chopping the forearm off to raise it, the body gets very disproportionate with only three cubes (after bending the torso and chopping off the last cube that was the forearm, the forearm is extruded up from the biceps. (It is possible I missed a step somewhere, but I don't think so).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A Bit Cursory ==

I felt like the explanation of the arms and legs got a bit cursory. It would be nice to have more pictures of what you did and more explanation of how you got that look. Some people (like me) are here not to just learn how to use Blender, but also to learn how to model. Thanks. --Kevin

: It's on my to-do list.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:41, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I made it to the end, but the second to last picture shows a set of toes the instructions dont provide!  Would love to know how to make those too.  Thanks for the hardwork!  I have the extruded feet though. Thanks a bunch again.

== Feature missing from Blender? ==

I can't find the selection mode buttons in Blender anywhere, and CTRL+TAB doesn't do anything.  Skips from the Lock button to the Render button on the header.  It's version 2.34, if that helps.

: That feature was introduced in version 2.35.  The current release is 2.36.  You need to update your version of the blender.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:08, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== selecting edges with older versions ==

Is there a way to select edges with older versions?
Updating from version 2.34 to 2.35 is an effort not everybody wants to take.
So what are the alternatives to get the same results with selecting edges using older versions of blender?

: Yes.  Selecting all vertices that are connected to an edge has the same effect as selecting the edge.  Just select all vertices that are connected to the edges that you want to select.  Out of curiosity, and also so that I can know if this information needs to be included with the tutorial because many other users are using 2.34; why not upgrade to 2.36?

:: becouse there doesn´t exist any precompiled binaries of 2.36 on the debian mirror servers.
:: In the meantime i´ve found out, that the downloadable packages from blender3d.org doasn´t need to be compiled - just copy them to the proper directory and start the executable. But nevertheless, Debian comes with a package management system called &quot;apt&quot; - which takes no notice about any software, installd &quot;by hand&quot;. This means it cannot consider that software for resolving pckage dependecies, which means that one day, when other software will be updated, especially libraries, blender might refuse to start or might not run stable.
:: However, i prefer using apt for the installation of software as far as possible.

:::I'm familiar with Debian, used that distro for awhile and now using [http://ubuntulinux.org Ubuntu].  I'm going to add instructions for using the latest blender on all linux distros on the first page so that we're all up to speed with the latest and greatest. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:42, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)


== Make Face Problems ==

Hi, I am using Blender 2.36 and if I want to &quot;repair&quot; the hole in the arms. After pressing the FKEY a Windows pops up &quot;Make FGON?&quot; If I press &quot;Make&quot; the Error message &quot;No Faces are selected to make FGON&quot; comes up.

What is wrong? Thank you for your help.
--AiRWOLF


I think the &quot;Make Face&quot; function only works on 3 or 4 vertices.  Try selecting only 4 at at time, to fill up gradually.  Also, make sure you have non-visible vertices non-selectable &quot;Limit Selection to Visible&quot; on your button bar, as it can pick up more than 4 if you think you just have 4.

'''Also:''' Make sure to remove doubled vertices... I had this problem and fixed it by hitting the '''WKEY''' and then selecting &quot;remove doubles&quot;.


FGON (fake N-Gon) only works when faces are selected, not vertices. As it's name implies, it fakes a N-Gon by hiding edges. --Jamin3D

== Problem following tutorial ==

Hello, so far the tutorial has gone great.  I think it is very well done. But at the point of extruding the arms to bend them upward I am stuck.  

I was able to delete the outer portion of the first arm (making a hole) and fixing it with the FKey.  I then use the vertex select mode and select the top four vertices of the outer arm and hit the EKey to extrude them.  

In your screenshots, at this point the model is shown sourounded in small cube bounding boxes, but mine is not. It looks just as it did in the previous screenshots of the tutorial, without the boxes.  

The problem is when I extrude the vertices they extude out at normals to the arm surface, getting further apart from each other. It doesn't look like it supposed to.

I am able to use Ctrl-Z to restore, but I can't get past this point.  

Please help a noobie figure out what I'm missing.

Thanks!

David.


:I can't really help you with the extrusion as mine went fine. But the boxes can easily be switched on 
:and off by the optimal button under the sub division option.
:All i did was select the top faces of the last &quot;box bit&quot; ,pressed EKey and chose region then held ctrl(PC)
:and choose the desired length of one box.
:Hope this is of any help,
:Sledz41

:: Thanks Sledz41!


::OP's right.  The containment box doesn't show up simply by pressing the &quot;Optimal Draw&quot;.  I had to hit last (2) buttons on the &quot;Subsurf&quot; bar (&quot;Enable modifier during interactive display&quot; and &quot;Enable modifier during Editmode&quot;).  That caused a new button to appear (&quot;Enable modifier to editing cage during Editmode&quot;) and when I hit THAT, I finally got my boxes back.  --RavinDave

== Blender 2.37a and this tutorial ==

I am using Blender 2.37a and have reached the point in the tutorial where the extended arm is cut off. Up to an including that point all went well. However &quot;mending&quot; the open end of the arm has stopped me. I can select the vertices at the arm's end, but hitting the space bar/edit/faces/make edge-face yields yet another choice (not mentioned in the tutorial). A small menu appears labeled &quot;FGon&quot; and wants me to choose &quot;make&quot; or &quot;clear.&quot; I choose &quot;make&quot; and get the error message: &quot;Error: No faces selected to make FGon.&quot; Does the tutorial need updating for v.2.376a? Or, what might I have done incorrectly? (Also the picture of the cutoff arm is a tube in a wireframe rectangular parallelopiped - my picture at that point is somewhat less simple but quite reasonable following the instructions - a minor point perhaps.) 

Any help or information will be appreciated.

I just had the same problem. The problem comes from a degenerated face. If you switch to face selection, you will notice a face that is on an edge. The solution i came up with was to juste delete the whole arm but its basis and redo it again. By carefully redoing the manipulation again (so without creating at some point this wrong face), it worked out well.

I have a similar problem.  I've extruded the arms upward and resealed one elbow hole, but when I try to reseal the other one, the new face is flat instead of curving smoothly underneath the arm.  I can't think of anything I did differently on either arm.

[[User:JDspeeder1|JDspeeder1]]

PS. I figured it out, the problem arm is one &quot;cube&quot; too short between the shoulder and the elbow.

== Elbow Patch ==

I'm following this tutorial and I get to the part where you make the arms bend up. When I fix the hole in his elbow, he gets something resembling a patch on his elbow. Using blender 2.34

== Definition needed ==

The tutorial says &quot;Under KDE, CTRL+TAB changes desktop so you will have to use the statusline buttons instead.&quot;  What is KDE?

Is it this: [[Using KDE]] ?

I think it's telling you what to do if you have that KDE thingie.

:KDE is a graphical desktop environment for Linux and Unix workstations. (http://www.kde.org/)  CTRL+TAB must be a shortcut specific to that operating system, hence the warning note to users of KDE.

== Scaling with axis constraint section ==

:''Moved comment from book text''

I was rolling along nice until this section. Needs to be more clear and some of the new things you use aren't explained beyond, click button x. Mike, Aug 2, 2006

::Yes, I can tell that there was an editor coming through reworking the text who stopped at this section... all of a sudden I have to learn to follow an entirely new style of prose.

== Problem with FGon ==

Hello, I'm using Blender 2.41, I want to repair the hole in the arms. I select only four vertices, after pressing the FKEY a Window pops up says:  FGon: Make, Clear. When I press &quot;Make&quot; the Error message &quot;Didn't find FGon to create&quot; comes up.
What happens? Thanks for your help.

Update: this happens if you haven't deselected the four vertices that you have just used for extruding (so you actually have eigth vertices selected, four in the elbow and four in the &quot;hand&quot;). Perhaps a warning note could be added in the tutorial.

== Successfully completed this tutorial on 2006-09-20 ==

I completed this tutorial on 2006-09-20 using Blender 2.42a.  I only found one confusing thing that should be added/clarified.  About half way down the page you are instructed to change the ''Rotation/Scaling Pivot'' to 3D Cursor.  However, you are never instructed to change the ''Rotation/Scaling Pivot'' back to Median Point.  Everything seems fine until you try to do the scaling on the head.  If your pivot is still down at the hips then scaling the head won't work right.  Upon changing the pivot cursor back to Median Point the head will scale as described in the tutorial.  An instruction about this should be added at the appropriate place.  Also, the red text before the &quot;Modeling the arms&quot; section which says &quot;Screenshots and more specific instructions needed for this section.&quot; should possibly be removed (I think its old).  After working through that section I didn't have any problem understanding the directions and the screenshots were helpful and adequate.  (BTW, I am a beginner to Blender.)

== Picture problem still there. ==

Um, perhaps somebody decided to fix the problem of the pictures encroaching on the text right this moment, and deleted the discussion pertaining to that, or maybe not. Whatever the reason, ten seconds ago there was a discussion on the pictures covering the text and now it is gone, strangely, right after I replied to it. Anyway, it's still a problem.

: Oh, wait, I just messed it up, nevermind. Here it is. --[[User:207.6.170.68|207.6.170.68]] 01:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

some text ist covered by a picture, i can't read it. but i realized that everything looks perfectly right, if i choose a bigger fontsize. if you could try the same i would be thankful. i think this is a central problem of wikimedia projects: the pictures are somewhere else, belonging to your fontsize.
any ideas to fix it? i hope i could help you...

== Small issue with scaling ==
The tutorial says &quot;Note, you cannot scale along the Z-axis, as the current selection's Z-dimension is zero.&quot; Shouldn't it also point out that you can't scale on Y either, since the two selected edges are parallel on the z-plane? 

== Coordinate System ==
Is Y the depth in blender? Top view shows the Y axis going back in space? The coordinate system should be mentioned somewhere in the tutorial.

On the version of Blender that I have, 2.49a, a new scene is presented seen from the top, with y being up on the screen, x to the left and z toward the viewer. However, when we get to this part, the z is up, x is to the right and y points away from the viewer. This should be pointed out somewhere in the instructions to avoid confusion. - Bonapon

== My own small issue with the tutorial ==

So I just picked up this tutorial today, and when I reached the part about Modeling the arms, I wasn't able to figure out what this part meant. &quot;Before you begin, also uncheck '''the roundish button''' to make the arms into cubes again. You can change them back after you are done.&quot;  
Where specifically is this Roundish button, and is it even still in v2.44?

Thanks for the help in advance

== There many problems starting at &quot;Scaling section&quot; ==

I am having a lot of trouble pulling out of this page what I need to do make my model look like the example. It's way to embedded in the discussion. It's like this part is rushed. 

I would like to see a more recipe oriented step-wise approach. Either followed or proceeded by a general discussion of each of the steps. The way it is now leaves a lot to be desired. For instance at the start of each section it should be stated something to the effect &quot;In this section will do some ''task'' using the this ''technique''&quot;. From there either describe the general technique or techniques then give step by step instructions to accomplish said task or vice versa. We are noobs we need everything explained, or least I do.  

--[[User:Gilgamesh007|Gilgamesh007]] 19:39, 27 May 2007 (UTC)


I cannot follow this section.  It's not clear which three faces are being selected from either picture or text, but more importanntly when I precisely follow the directions the scaling does not produce the pictured result.  The three boxes simply push everything else aside instead of graduating into them.

== I can't find the manipulator hand icon. Is it important? ==
Under scaling with axis constraints.

I can't find this either. It also shows a five-fingered hand in the tutorial. No such icon appears when simply following the instructions in this tutorial. There is that one-finger icon though.

== Confusing newbie note ==

What does the Newbie Note mean? On the part where the arm is to be extruded upward, it says &quot;Newbie note: this looks more natural if you extrude 1 square using Rotate Manipulator Mode, and 2 squares using Scale Manipulator Mode.&quot;

What exactly is its effect? Natural in what way? There is no explanation... only that it &quot;looks more natural&quot;. I tried this and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Does manipulator mode affect extrusion at all? 

I think that newbie note only serves to further confuse readers. 

(Edit: very sorry about my comment on the article page itself. I have move my comment here. I was going to remove my comment from the main page and suddenly couldn't find it... Editor removal was almost instantaneous!)

I removed that note. [[Special:Contributions/84.49.71.107|84.49.71.107]] ([[User talk:84.49.71.107|talk]])

== Drawing the armpits ==

 We'll now use the 3D cursor instead of the selection's center: bring up the Mesh → Snap menu (SHIFT-SKEY) and select 
 Cursor → Selection (KEY4). This will move the 3D cursor to the location of the manipulator.

Mentioning &quot;KEY4&quot; as a shortcut seems like it would globally refer to &quot;cursor-&gt;selection&quot; while actually it refers
to &quot;select 4th item in the active menu&quot; if a menu is active, and &quot;show 4th layer&quot; if viewing 3d-window.
Either it should be mentioned earlier in the tutorial that numeric keys can be used to quick select menu items, or it should be given a sidenote on this page &quot;(KEY4 selects the item when the menu is active)&quot;. Just my opinion there, but I found it confusing for the all 5 seconds it took me to try out the alternative behaviors with different menus.

== comment removed from module ==

Hi, I'm Thomas, and I got stuck in the section with elbow. So, I selected those four vertices around the gap and pressed FKEY. A face covered this gap, I guess that's good ... but the elbow is not curved like in screenshots in this tutorial. The whole arm is like a cut cylinder, not smooth curve towards the top. Maybe that's not so important, but I feel like this new face is not connected to the whole object at all ... when I try to move it, only the face and its vertices move; arm stays untouched ( I mean, when I move this face, it detaches from the arm, arm is not bending like it should ).

Here is a link to my screenshot: http://i340.photobucket.com/albums/o324/tomalla5120x/Temporary/temp.jpg

Any ideas?

I can't do the first one..how do I get the white circle to where it is on the image?

== Pelvis widening? ==

When I first viewed ''Noob to Pro/Detailing Your Simple Person 2,'' I saw a section on widening the pelvis proportionately from the center. It no longer seems to be included in this page. Am I wrong? What happened to that section?[[User:Mtjlt|Mtjlt]] ([[User talk:Mtjlt|talk]]) 12:23, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

:I removed it during the recent revamp.  I figure if we show people how to widen the torso, they can figure out for themselves how to enlarge other body parts.  --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 19:51, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

== Premade Model ==

I downloaded the premade model to make sure i did the previos tutorials right and noticed that the
premade model wasn't right! There are 8 double vertices and the pelvis is slightly deformed. Maybe
someone should make a new premade model. --[[Special:Contributions/174.1.138.178|174.1.138.178]] ([[User talk:174.1.138.178|talk]]) 05:49, 24 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''New Mexico Pork Tamales''' are a classic Southwestern United States meal, made from pork and chicken.  This version adds cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to outer masa flour of the tamale.

==Ingredients==
===Meat filling===
*1 cup shredded cooked [[Cookbook:Pork|pork ]]
*1 cup shredded cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken ]]
*1 (15 ounce - ~400g) can beanless chili con carne
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|cooking oil]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
*1 tablespoon garlic powder 
*2 teaspoons ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 

===Wrappers===
*1 (8 ounce - 230g) package of corn husks (contains about 100 husks)

===Masa mixture===
*2 pounds (900g) [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|Masa flour]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
*3 tablespoons chili powder
*3 tablespoons garlic powder
*1 tablespoon ground cumin
*2 tablespoons salt
*2 cups solid vegetable shortening
*8 cups warm [[Cookbook:Chicken_Stock#Chicken|chicken stock]] (or 8 cups water and 8 chicken bullion cubes)

==Procedure==
===Meat filling===
#Stir ingredients together and refrigerate until needed.

===Wrappers===
#Soak corn husks in warm water for at least two hours. A dinner plate may have to be used to hold corn husks under water.

===Masa mixture===
#Mix dry Masa flour with paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and salt. Mix well for even distribution of spices.
#Cut shortening into the Masa mixture with a pastry cutter. Mix until mixture resembles the texture of tiny peas.
#Slowly add chicken broth one cup at a time. Mix well with electric mixer. Mixture should resemble consistency of peanut butter.
#Continue mixing with electric mixer to incorporate air into batter. Mixture is ready to use when 1 teaspoon of batter floats on water.

===Filling and cooking tamales===
#Use one corn husk per tamale. Lay flat on table. The corn husk is roughly rectangle shaped.
#Spread 1/2 cup of Masa mixture on entire upward facing corn husk, leaving a 1 inch (2.5cm) gap along the long edge and narrow end of the corn husk. 
#Spread 1 tablespoon of meat mixture, in a narrow band in the middle, down the length of the masa spread corn husk.
#Roll/fold the husk along the wide edge, touching the edges of the masa together, with the meat mixture ending up in the middle of the masa. The part of the husk with the 1 inch gap with no masa should be rolled around the outside of the husk.
#Fold about 1 inch of end of rolled husk, upward along the body of the husk. (The narrow end with 1 inch masa gap). You should end up with something resembling a cornucopia, with one end folded over and one end open.
#Stand all of the rolled tamales on end in a steaming colander with the open end of the tamale facing upward.
#Steam the tamales over boiling water for 2 hours. Place a lid over the steaming colander. Keep the tamales above the boiling water, don't allow them to stand in it.
#At the end of the cooking period, open one tamale and make sure the masa is cooked and not doughy.
#Allow tamales to rest 30 minutes after cooking, before serving. This will help to keep the masa from sticking to the corn husk.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Makes about 50 to 75 tamales.
*Left over tamales may be frozen in zip lock bags.
*Reheat frozen tamales in a microwave. If you reheat by steaming, they may become soggy.

Electrical motors and generators are machines which either convert electrical energy inputs into forces or applied kinetic energy inputs into electrical energy. In principle, any electrical generator can also be operated as a motor and vice-versa. In practice they will often be optimized for one application or the other.

All electrical machines operate due the same principles derived from the study of electro-magnetics. Therefore, it is appropriate to first discuss these underlying electromagnetic concepts as this is crucial for understanding their operation. However, before discussing these concepts it will also be useful to revise the concepts of vector algebra and vector calculus which are used extensively in this subject.

== Vectors and Fields ==
The use of vectors and vector fields greatly simplifies the analysis of many electromagnetic (and indeed other) systems. Due to their usefulness, these concepts will be used extensively in this book. For this reason it will be useful to begin with a general treatment of the subject.

=== Vectors ===
A [[Wikipedia:Euclidean vector|vector]] is a quantity which has both magnitude,direction and sense. the magnitude of a vector represents its size as a physical quantity, the direction; represents its position with respect to a reference axis, whlie its sense; represents its orientation and it is represented by its arrow head. This is in contrast to a [[Wikipedia:Scalar (physics)|scalar]] which has only magnitude. Examples of scalar quantities include temperature, resistivity, voltage and mass. In comparison, examples of vector quantities would include velocity, force, acceleration and position.

The most familiar and intuitive use of vectors is in the two-dimensional or three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This is the familiar system of x, y and z coordinates.

=== Fields ===
The term ''field'' has a general meaning in mathematics and physics, but here we will be referring only to the special cases of [[Wikipedia:Scalar field|scalar]] and [[Wikipedia:Vector field|vector]] fields. Generally, a field is a region in space where the quantity in question, exist and its influence is being felt. A scalar field is a region of space in which each point is associated with a scalar value. A classic example of a scalar field is a temperature field in a heated block of material. 

If some heat source is applied to a cube of a conductive material, such as a metal, the temperature in the block will be highest where the heat source is applied, dropping off as we move away from the source in any direction. At every position inside the block a value could be assigned which is the temperature at this point. These temperature values make up the scalar temperature field in the block. It might be that it is possible to model accurately these values with some mathematical function, but the field itself is simply the variation in the scalar quantity in the space occupied by the block.

A vector field differs from a scalar field in that it has not only a magnitude at every position, but also ''direction''. A good example of a vector field is the velocity of the fluid flow in a winding river of changing width. Clearly at every point in the river, the velocity of the fluid will have a magnitude (the speed) which will be lower where the river is wide, and higher where the river is narrow. However, the flow will also have a direction which changes as the water is forced around the river bends. If we noted the fluid speed and direction everywhere in the river, the result would be a vector field of the fluid flow.

In addition to varying in space, fields can also vary in time. In the first example, if we started with a cold block and then applied the heat source, mapping the temperature field at set time intervals, it would be seen that the values of the temperature at every point would change as the heat conducted throughout the block over time. The result therefore is a scalar field that varies in the three dimensions of space and one of time.

== Magnetic Field Concepts ==
An electromagnetic field is a region of space in which electrical charges experience forces. The classical definition of the electromagnetic field is given by the following equation 

::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E}+q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;P&gt;
What this equation states, is that an electrical charge of size {{math|q}} experiences a force when in the presence of an electric field denoted by {{math|'''E'''}}. Furthermore if the charge is moving, with velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, it will experience a further force if in the presence of a magnetic field denoted by {{math|'''B'''}}. Therefore the force on a electric charge ''defines'' what the electric and magnetic fields are in a given region of space. Without the presence of a charged particle it could never be known what their magnitudes or directions were.

== AC generators ==
* A very simple AC generator consists of a permanent magnet that rotates inside a coil in such a way that the N-pole and S-pole alternate as seen from the coil. An analog voltmeter (or rather a millivoltmeter?) that has its zero at the middle of the scale is connected to the ends of the coil. As the magnet is rotated the voltmeter moves first one way, then the other way. The speed of rotation determines the number of [[w:-cycle|&quot;cycles per second&quot;]], called Hertz(Hz). A rotation speed of 3000 revolutions per minute(RPM) produces 50 Hz, and 3600 RPM produce 60 Hz.
* The rotating permanent magnet can be replaced by another coil that is fed by DC and acts as an [[FHSST Physics Electromagnetism:Electromagnetism|electromagnet]]. Doubling the number of coils will double the number of, what is called &quot;the poles&quot;, and then only half the rotation speed is required for a given output frequency. 
*See also [[w:Alternator|Wikipedia: Alternator]]
AC generator works on the principle of Faraday's laws electro-magnetics.

== AC motors ==
AC motors are generally divided into two categories, induction and synchronous motors. The most common AC motor is the &quot;Squirrel cage motor&quot;, a type of induction motor. These have only one or more coils within which a special kind of mechanical rotor is free to rotate. There is no electrical connection to the rotor from the outside. The general formula to determine the synchronous speed of an induction motor is

&lt;math&gt;Speed = \frac{120f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

For induction motors, this is a theoretical speed, even though it will never be obtained. The motor will always run slower than synchronous speed with a slip of S. If a motor were to be operated at full synchronous speed, the relative speed of the rotor to the stator would be 0, making it impossible to induce a voltage (Faraday's law) in the rotor windings. This in turn would make the flow of current impossible. Without current no magnetic field can be generated.

Most AC motors require a starter, or method of limiting the inrush current to a reasonable level. Types of motor starting include reactive (capacitor start and inductive start), and electronic (frequency drives and [[Power Electronics#Soft Starters | soft start drives]]). The reactive start method is usually used on fractional horsepower motors, and the electronic method is usually reserved for larger motors (cost of the drives is the main reason for this). Connecting these motors to computers, PLC's (programmable logic controllers), and interfacing with automation systems, is becoming more prevalent.

== DC Generators ==
DC generators are basically AC generators whose output voltage is switched the other way round at the proper moment, so that the direction of the voltage is always in a single direction. But the magnitude of the voltage keeps changing, just as it does in an AC generator, and it can be said that the output of a DC generator is DC plus a &quot;superimposed&quot; AC voltage, called &quot;ripple&quot;. Connecting a capacitor across the output terminals reduces that ripple.
See also [[w:Electrostatic generator|Wikipedia: &quot;Testatika&quot; Electrostatic generators]]

== DC Motors ==
Direct Current (DC) motors have a &quot;Commutator&quot; that switches the part of the coil that is closest to the poles at the time, more or less similar to the legendary &quot;donkey&quot; that tries to catch the carrots, but never succeeds. See [[GCSE Science/The motor effect|the very simplified commutator shown in blue]].

Usually a commutator has many &quot;segments&quot;, as many as there are taps on the coil. Starting a DC motor requires often an external resistor or rheostat to limit the current. The value, in Ohms, of that resistor is reduced in steps as the speed of the motor increases, until finally that resistor is removed from the circuit as the motor reaches close to its final speed.

==Single Phase Alternating Current==
===From a wire in a magnetic field to the Mains/line power source===
Basically an electric voltage is generated in a wire if either that wire is in a &lt;u&gt;changing&lt;/u&gt; magnetic field, or if the wire is moved into or out of a magnetic field. '''Single phase''' Alternating voltage (and '''Alternating Current''' if there is something connected to that wire or coil) is produced when a magnet, or magnet equivalent, is rotated inside a coil of wire. The more turns of wire there are in that coil, the higher the [[voltage]], and the faster the rotation, the higher the [[Wikipedia:frequency|frequency]]. If a graph would be drawn showing the relation of the  voltage at the terminals of the coil with time, then that graph would be of sinusoidal shape, alternating between positive (+''V''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and negative (&amp;minus;''V''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) in a complete rotation. If the coil would be rotated at a speed of 3000 revolutions per minute, then there would be 3000/60=50 cycles per second (= 50 Hz), the unit's name being Hertz (Hz), and if the coil would be rotated at 3600 revolutions per minute then the voltage would change at a [[Wikipedia:frequency|frequency]] of 60 Hz. The usual AC (mains or line) frequency is 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the country concerned.


The electrical power available in North American homes is single phase 60 Hertz 120 volts.  AC current's advantage over DC current is the efficient transmission over long distances using step-up and step-down transformers.
*Note that [[Electronics/Transformers|3-phase transformer]]s are, in fact, 3 '''single-phase''' transformers whose voltages are 120 degrees displaced from the other two, and that any terminal of a [[Electronics/Transformers|3-phase transformer]]  versus the neutral terminal (shown as '''N''' below) has a single phase voltage. A building's load could, for example, be divided into three separate single-phase loads, more or less equal to one another; these loads would be supplied from a three-phase transformer, all three voltages being versus the neutral terminal; that terminal is usually connected to ground/earth. 


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:240120SinglePhaseWaveform.gif]] --&gt;


120 volts is the root mean square (&lt;math&gt;V_{rms}&lt;/math&gt;) of the maximum voltage (&lt;math&gt;V_{max}&lt;/math&gt;) .


&lt;math&gt;V_{rms} = \frac {V_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;V_{max} = V_{rms} \cdot \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;V_{max} = 120\ volts \cdot 1.414 = 170\ volts&lt;/math&gt;

==Wikibooks World History and Maps==
Hello. I've been working on a series of world history maps, many of which are uploaded to Wikimedia commons on my [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Talessman/Maps Talessman Maps] page, and on [http://www.worldhistorymaps.info www.WorldHistoryMaps.info]. I would like to contribute to Wikibooks: World History, and was told I should contact you. Respectfully, [[User:Talessman|talessman]] ([[User talk:Talessman|talk]]) 07:37, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

I have recently taken the AP World History exam and revived a 5(In addition to 800 on the SAT test), I think I could help this project.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] flour
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] baking powder
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] sugar
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] salt
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] soy milk
*vegetable oil

==Procedure==
{| style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 242px; border: #99B3FF solid 1px&quot;
| {{Vegan recipe}}
|}
#Mix all dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.
#Mix soy milk into the dry ingredients.
#Heat a griddle until water sprinkled on it quickly evaporates. Spread a thin film of oil on the griddle.
#Pour pancake batter on griddle to form 4- to 5-inch circles. Bubbles should start forming.
#When the underside is light brown, flip the pancake.
#When the other side is light brown, serve.

==Variations==
*Banana pancakes: add one well mashed banana to the batter.
*Chocolate pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] chocolate chips to the batter.
*Walnut pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] roughly chopped walnuts to the batter.
*Cranberry pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dried cranberries to the batter.

Any of the above ingredients can be mixed together.

==Notes==
* Don't over mix! Over mixing will produce gluten; this will inhibit rising and make the pancakes rubbery.
* Optionally, you can serve your pancakes with syrup or jam.
* Substituting rice milk for soy milk may make the pancakes fall apart more easily.

==The Scramble for Africa==
Starting in the late 1800s, the nations of Europe began to take a huge interest in colonizing Africa.  The discovery of quinine, an effective vaccine against malaria allowed European explorers to crisscross the continent in the 1870s and 1880s.  In the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, the European nations divided up the continent among themselves, without taking into account the preexisting African boundaries.  By 1914, almost all of Africa, with the exception of Liberia and Ethiopia, was under the control of one of the European powers.

==The Germans==
===German East Africa===
On March 3, 1885, the German government announced that it had gone wild and got wet
 an imperial charter (secretly, on February 17) to Carl Peters' company, and intended to establish a protectorate in East Africa. Peters then recruited a variety of specialists who fanned out across the country, south to the Rufiji River and north to Witu, near Lamu on the coast.

The Germans quickly established their rule over Bagamoyo, Dar es Salaam and Kilwa. The Abushiri Revolt started in 1888 and was put down (with British help) in the following year. In 1890, London and Berlin concluded the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, a deal that gave Heligoland to Germany, and defined the limits of German East Africa (the exact borders remained ill-defined until 1910).

Through a series of alliances with Native Tribes, the Germans expanded their colonies. German colonial administrators relied heavily on native chiefs to keep order and collect taxes. Other than local police, garrisons of Schutztruppe soldiers at Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Iringa and Mahenge consisted on 1 January 1914 of 110 German officers (including 42 medical officers), 126 non-commissioned officers and 2,472 local soldiers.

General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, a vibrant and young officer, he spent the war harrying the forces of the British Empire, tying down with his band of 3,000 Europeans &amp; 11,000 native Askaris and porters, a British/Imperial army 300,000 strong, which was at times commanded by the former Second Boer War commander Jan Smuts. One of his greatest victories was at the Battle of Tanga (3–5 November, 1914), where he beat a British force more than eight times the size of his own. Lettow-Vorbeck's masterful mix of guerrilla warfare and daring raids ended up costing the British war effort massive resources and upwards of 60,000 casualties. Nonetheless, weight of numbers, especially after forces coming from Belgian Congo had attacked from the West, and dwindling supplies, forced Lettow-Vorbeck into a grudging withdrawal, shortly before the agreed cease-fire.

==The Belgians==

===The Congo===
Belgium itself had only been independent since 1830. King Leopold II tried to interest his government in establishing colonies but it lacked the resources to develop the candidate territories and turned down his plans.

During the Berlin West Africa Conference(1884-1885) the area of the Congo was granted to the Belgians. Leopold originally ruled it personally, as he own private property. He immidiently began to exploit its valuable resources. However, it was at the cost of the African Laborers. Leopolds regime was abolutely brutal. African laborers who did not preform well enough were often pushied by having their hands cut off. In 1904 the ''Casement Report'' was released. It told the grim tales of killings, mutilation, kidnapping and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement. Leopold offered to reform his regime, but few took him seriously. All nations were now agreed that the King's rule must be ended as soon as possible, but no nation was willing to take on the responsibility. The Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration on November 15, 1908, four years after the Casement Report and six years after the first printing of Heart of Darkness.

When the Belgian Government took over the Administration from King Leopold II, the situation in the Congo improved marginally. Belgians were largely ambivalent towards the colony, so it suffered from a vacillatory governance. Because of this attitude, Belgium was usually a decade behind other colonial powers in its methods of governance, and was surprised when the Congo moved towards independence in the 1950's. Political administration fell under the total and direct control of the coloniser; there were no democratic institutions. The head of the state remained the King of the Belgians (who, already at the time, no longer had any political influence). The Belgian government controlled the country, but day-to-day operations were carried out by the governor general. 

Following the Léopoldville riots in March 1959 and Kasavubu's incarceration, 1959 initially saw the legalization of all Congolese political parties, followed by general elections throughout the Congo. In 1960, the Round Table of Brussels was convened and occurred between January 20 and February 20. Congolese representatives and Belgians set the stage for nationwide elections later in the year. The Belgian Congo achieved independence on June 30, 1960 under the name &quot;Republic of Congo&quot; or &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot;.

===Ruanda-Urundi===
In the First World War, the area was conquered by forces from the Belgian Congo in 1916. The Treaty of Versailles divided German East Africa with the vast majority known as Tanganyika going to Great Britain but the westernmost portion to Belgium, this area was formally referred to as the Belgian Occupied East African Territories. In 1924, they became Ruanda-Urundi when the League of Nations issued a formal mandate that granted Belgium full control over the area.

The Belgians demanded that the territories earn profits for the motherland and any development had to come out of funds gathered in the territory. These funds mostly came from the extensive cultivation of coffee in the region's rich volcanic soils. The populace was also extensively taxed and forced to perform corvée labor. 

After the League of Nations was dissolved the region became a United Nations trust territory in 1946. This included the promise that the Belgians would prepare the areas for independence, but the Belgians felt the area would take many decades to ready for self rule.

Independence came largely as a result of actions elsewhere. In the 1950s an independence movement arose in the Belgian Congo, and the Belgians became convinced they could no longer control the territory. In 1960, Ruanda-Urundi's larger neighbor gained its independence. After two more years of hurried preparations the colony became independent on July 1, 1962, broken up along traditional lines as the independent nations of Rwanda and Burundi. It took two more years before the government of the two became wholly separate.

==The Dutch==

===Suriname===
Suriname had been a Dutch colony since 1667. The Dutch planters relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate the coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Treatment of the slaves by their owners was notoriously bad, and many slaves escaped the plantations. 

Slavery was abolished by the Netherlands in Suriname in 1863, but the slaves in Suriname were not fully released until 1873, after a mandatory 10 year transition period during which time they were required to work on the plantations for minimal pay and without state sanctioned torture. As a plantation colony, Suriname was still heavily dependent on manual labor, and to make up for the shortfall, the Dutch brought in contract laborers from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) and India (through an arrangement with the British). In addition, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, small numbers of mostly men were brought in from China and the Middle East.

In 1954, the Dutch placed Suriname under a system of limited self-government, with the Netherlands retaining control of defense and foreign affairs. In 1973, negotiations started with the Dutch government leading towards full independence, which was granted on November 25, 1975. The severance package was very substantial, and a large part of Suriname's economy for the first decade following independence was fueled by foreign aid provided by the Dutch government.

===The East Indies===
The Dutch East India Company (VOC) had been set up in the early seventeenth century to maximize Dutch trade interests in the Malay archipelago. By 1700, a colonial pattern was well established; the VOC had grown to become a state-within-a-state and the dominant power in the archipelago. Its method of indirect rule was to survive it. After the bankrupt company was liquidated on January 1, 1800, its territorial possessions became the property of the Dutch government.

In an 1811 to 1816 interregnum, during the Napoleonic Wars, the British took over administration of several Dutch East Indies posts including Java before Dutch control was restored. The 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, ceded Dutch control of Malacca, the Malay Peninsula, and possessions in India to Britain in exchange for British settlements in Indonesia, such as Bengkulu in Sumatra. Batavia remained the capital of the colony. 
[[Image:Evolution of the Dutch East Indies.png|thumb|300px|Dutch Expansion in the East Indies]]
For most of the Dutch East Indies history, and that of the VOC before it, Dutch control over these territories was tenuous; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become the boundaries of modern-day Indonesia. Although Java was under Dutch domination for most of the 350 years of the combined VOC and Dutch East Indies era, many areas remained independent for much of this time including Aceh, Lombok, and Borneo.

There were numerous wars and disturbances across the archipelago as various indigenous Indonesian groups resisted efforts to establish a Dutch hegemony, which weakened Dutch control and tied up its military forces. In the seventeenth century the VOC had used its superior arms, and Buginese (from Sulawesi) and Ambonese (from Maluku) mercenaries to expand and protect its trading interests across the archipelago. During the Dutch East Indies era, the most prolonged conflicts were the Padri War in Sumatra (1821–38), the Java War (1825–30) led by Prince Diponegoro, and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh.

Disturbances continued to break out on both Java and Sumatra during the remainder of the 19th century, and between 1846 and 1849, expeditions to conquer Bali were largely unsuccessful. The Banjarmasin War in south east Borneo resulted in the Dutch defeat of the sultan. In Aceh, guerrilla leaders fought off Dutch invasion in what was the longest and bloodiest conflict from 1873 to Acehnese surrender in 1908. As exploitation of Indonesian resources expanded off Java, most of the outer islands came under direct Dutch government control or influence. Significant Indonesian piracy remained a problem for the Dutch until the mid-19th century.

Southwestern Sulawesi was occupied in 1905–06, the island of Bali in 1906, and the Bird's Head Peninsula (West Papua), was brought under Dutch administration in 1920. The invasion and occupation of Indonesia during World War II, brought about the destruction of the colonial state in Indonesia, as the Japanese removed as much of the Dutch state as they could, replacing it with their own regime. Although the top positions were held by the Japanese, the internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, nationalist leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence. After a 4 year war, in which the Dutch re-occupied most of the colony, Indonesia was granted independence on December 27, 1949 due largely to international pressure. 

In 1949, when the rest of the Dutch East Indies became fully independent as Indonesia, the Dutch retained sovereignty over western New Guinea, and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. Some five thousand teachers were flown there. The Dutch put an emphasis upon political, business, and civic skills. Indonesia attempted to invade the region on December 18, 1961. Following some skirmishes between Indonesian and Dutch forces an agreement was reached and the territory was placed under United Nations administration in October 1962 It was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963. The territory was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.

== Updating this template ==

Just in the interest of trying to keep a good thing going, I have on my own been updating this template for the past several months (June-August 2005).  If you think something else ought to go here, feel free to change this template, especially if it is out of date.  If we need to start ''voting'' on these articles, go ahead and do that too, but when I took over it had already been several months since the original implementation, and that was for an article of the ''week'', which IMHO was too short of a period of time for Wikibooks to even look at.

I have noticed that the articles that get focus do get some increased activity in terms of people adding some more content, so this is proving to be of some value.  Keep in mind that you (especially if you have been able to even find this talk page) are just as valid in your opinions on this subject as anybody else.  Have fun and help Wikibooks as well. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:01, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

I've been updating these for a few months now. But I'd like some other opinions, as I'm really just selecting articles that are interesting to me and need work. Does anyone else have any suggestions for December or an idea for a less arbitrary process?

I'm also thinking about tagging articles of the month with a banner. Does anyone have any opinions about that? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 12:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Weight: does it mean mass or force? ==
Please also see other discussions on this topic at 
and
[[Wikipedia:Weight]]
and
[[User:Kernigh/pound]].


== Renewing perspective ==

I was going to step back for a while to see what came of people's contributions other than mine or from Metric1000, but then thought something I wrote elsewhere might help:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I'd say that as most of us aren't practising scientists we don't use the word 'mass' that much in our everyday life on Earth...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If so, I reckon young people must use the word 'mass' even less - I probably didn't use it until I started studying science as physics, chemistry and biology - so why don't we write this module from the point of view of your 'weight' - i.e. that thing you measure when you step onto the bathroom scale - changing from one planet etc to the next, whilst you don't (unless, say, you go on a diet or start bingeing)? Then say the &quot;stuff&quot; that goes to make up you (or anything else) is what you may've heard people refer to as 'mass' (especially scientists) so although your or something else's 'mass' remains the same from planet to planet or the like (so long as you don't diet or binge etc) your 'weight' changes. Why does your 'weight' change? Enter a little about gravity. Well, something along those lines and not necessarily in that order.

Potentially much simpler and I don't think it need compromise the situation we have here on Earth where most (adult) people use the words 'weight' and 'mass' interchangeably.

:How is this a weight point-of-view if you still mention mass and gravity? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
:: Sorry not to be more clear; I was writing in more of a stream-of-consciousness manner than usual. What I mean is start the module from something young people are likely to've experienced, viz. that measurement called 'weight' given to you by a bathroom scale. This is certainly a measurement that would produce a different result when tried on the Moon, Mars, etc. Then move on to contrast that with what doesn't change, viz. your mass. Then touch on gravity to indicate why there's a difference. [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 23:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Suppose you have a fishing line that will break if a force of 50 newtons is applied to it.  With that, you should be able to lift a 5 kilogram catfish out of the river on Earth.
:::Now, suppose you put your boat out on the Sea of Tranquility.  That line will still break if a force of 50 newtons is applied to it.  But now you should be able to lift a 31 kg catfish out of the &quot;Sea&quot; with that line.
:::Then, cut out a couple of steaks, throw them on the fire, and toss on a handful of green cheese as it gets warm!  &quot;Oooohh, sooo good!&quot;  Or maybe that belongs in the Cookbook namespace? [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:45, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:That doesn't work at all.  &quot;Your weight&quot; DOES NOT CHANGE as that term is used by professionals in the medical sciences, nor even as it is used in sports such as the Olympic weight classes (63 kg, etc.) for judoka, boxers, wrestlers, and the like.  Do you suppose you could calculate for us how much difference there was in weightlifting in the mass of a 20 kg &quot;weight&quot; at the Helsinki Olympics and the mass of a 20 kg &quot;weight&quot; at the Mexico City Olympics?

:I agree, we do not often use the word &quot;mass&quot; in our everyday lives.  But that doesn't mean we are unfamiliar with the concept.  We do indeed '''very often''' use the quantity which physicists or astronomers call by the name ''mass'' in their own jargon.  We simply call it by the name we had already been using for hundreds of years before anybody ever used the word ''mass'' with that meaning:  we call it ''weight''.

:Like I said before, you '''can choose not to call this quantity weight''.  But that is your only option.

:It is not a legitimate, viable alternative to continue to call it ''weight'', but to misapply a definition of that ambiguous word which is inappropriate to the context. 

:People have long known that it is harder to push a &quot;heavy&quot; boat away from the dock than it is to push a &quot;light&quot; boat away from the dock.  That is one everyday way in which people have experienced the effects of mass in a way mostly unrelated to the pull of gravity, something we as a people have been familiar with for thousands of years.

Please, Metric1000, this is a module in a book meant for young people. I hope you'd agree that 'weighing' yourself on a bathroom scale is something young people are likely to've encountered (unlike the notion of Olympic weight classes, changes in 'weight' due to altitude, etc) and your 'weight' as given by such a scale &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; change if you 'weighed' yourself using it on the Moon, Mars, etc. Perhaps you'd prefer to say something like &quot;the reading has changed&quot; as if something else hasn't, but &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; other than 'mass' would that &quot;something else&quot; be?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I agree, we do not often use the word &quot;mass&quot; in our everyday lives.  But that doesn't mean we are unfamiliar with the concept...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My point at the start of this thread is to suggest that most young people &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; unlikely to've linked the word 'mass' with the concept of 'amount of matter'. I'm sorry if you don't think that's clear.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 23:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, of course, it works the other way as well.  You don't have to call it ''mass''; you can use the familiar synonym ''weight'' instead.
:But you still can't apply the wrong meaning to it, and say or even imply that ''the students' weight'' would change.
:Your bathroom spring scale just won't quite work right on another planet.  Maybe you could paste on a new dial with the readings we want.  If your tool is broken, fix it.
:It's much like astronauts weighing themselves in a &quot;weightless&quot; environment.  None of our normal scales work at all.  So they had to find a different tool.  (What they do is set a spring in motion, and time its oscillations as they ride on it.)
:Note also another problem with those spring scales, even if what you want to measure is force.  Suppose you have one whose dial makes a full circle with 300 lb on it on Earth.  Then our 86 lb student will deflect this scale by about 103 degrees of arc.  But on the moon, that deflection will only be 17 degrees of arc.  The springs are too stiff to get much deflection at all.  On Pluto it would be much worse; only about 6 degrees of arc.  The springs are just too stiff to work very well for this purpose in those environments.  
:So if you have to change springs anyway, you might as well fix the dial at the same time, to get a good reading of mass in the location in which it will be used. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:30, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Or, just choose the new springs with a spring constant that will work with the old dial in the new environment.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Yes, of course, it works the other way as well.  You don't have to call it ''mass''; you can use the familiar synonym ''weight'' instead. But you still can't apply the wrong meaning to it, and say or even imply that ''the students' weight'' would change...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You hang something from a spring on Earth and the spring extends. I say that this extension indicates weight. Do you?&lt;/br&gt;
You hang the same thing from the same spring on the Moon and the spring extends, but not to the same length as when on Earth. Do you agree?&lt;/br&gt;
I say that this extension indicates weight. It is not the same length as the extension when on Earth, so I say the weight it indicates is not the same as that on Earth. In other words, I say the weight has changed.  

Weight changes when gravity changes. Mass doesn't change when gravity changes.

We need to come to some agreement on this. Anything else is and has been distraction.

Just don't use units like kilograms as units of weight.  That is the main thing Metric1000 and I have been saying.  The implication is that most science museums that have you step on a scale and see what you would weigh on the Moon or Jupiter (I've seen it) is completely unrealistic and attempts to suggest that your mass changes when you go to different planets.  That doesn't happen at all and is the whole point of this article and the &quot;myth buster&quot; that we are trying to cover.  The fine point that is a source of contention is that pounds-force is sometimes used to describe weight and used as a demonstration for how much your weight would change in a different gravitational field.  Pounds are used for both mass and force calculations.  This is most painfully demonstrated with the calculation of units for specific impulse of a rocket, which is measured in pound-seconds/pound, and usually just reported as seconds of specific impulse.  Unfortunately, this is actually pound(force)-seconds/pound(mass), so this isn't really proper reduction of units.  SI units for the same concept is N-s/kg, which shows more clearly how that is a false concept for seconds of impulse.  Specific impulse, BTW, is the measurement of the effeciency of a rocket engine and a way to compare how powerful one engine type is compared to another rocket design. Rocket scientists know about this unit screwup, but most scientific literature uses this corrupted unit of measurement anyway, even outside the USA.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:33, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

:Your &quot;myth buster&quot; is completely out of place in a '''Solar System''' book. It's way way off topic. This is '''not''' the place to be arguing over units for mass and weight, even if the subject wasn't '''unitless''' in the first place. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

::It is not ''off topic'' but indeed is the very topic that is the subject of this section.  This section was added to this Wikibook because it was felt that there were some &quot;special topics&quot; that covered all of the planets and would be endlessly repeated over and over again for each seperate planet.  This is indeed done with other Wikijunior books as well, so it is not a unique circumstance.  I will agree that this Wikimodule is a train wreck right now in terms of having it flow throughout the whole article.  It needs to change and that is apparent.  All I'm trying to do is to make a compromise that would be acceptable to everybody, and to point out what effect a change in gravity can have.  This is something hard to grasp, which is precisely why we seem to be having all of this argument right now.  I don't think a &quot;unitless&quot; relative comparison of each planet's acceleration at the surface is going to work out for kids.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Heh. It's on-topic for a section that is off-topic for the book. In other words, the subject matter matches the page but the page does not belong in this book. This isn't a physics book.

== ditch the units ==

This is silly. The use of unnecessary units for unitless values is bad,
even if we didn't have to deal with poundforce and such. Probably this
page should just be deleted.

Do like this:

'''People on Endor are pulled down with 1.23456 times as much force as they would be on Earth.'''

That's the number you need if you want to take your weight, in ''any''
system of units, and multiply it by something to get a feel for the
difference. It works for any loose idea of stones, pounds, newtons, grams,
slugs, etc.

If you decide to get all scientific, you can argue about units for   
''acceleration'', not force. Acceleration of gravity on Earth is 20/7
rods/microfortnight/microfortnight.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:This is exactly what I've done, if you look at the section &quot;How does gravity change what happens?&quot;, I put relative gravitational pull that is merely a comparison to that of the Earth.  BTW, I love both rods as length and microfortnights as a unit of time.  I even worked on a computer operating system (VMS) that used microfortnights as the internal clock measurement for system accounting purposes.  Only later did I catch the joke there, however.  Windows NT also used fortnights as a unit of measurement because after a fortnight of running continuously the OS would crash from an internal overflow bug in the system clock. (actually about 39.5 days of running, but that is close enough to a fortnight for this purpose.) --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:15, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Which is correct?
::*a.  The Earth's atmosphere is 75.5% nitrogen.
::*b.  The Earth's atmosphere is 78.1% nitrogen.
::The answer, of course, is both.  It depends on what is being compared to get these dimensionless ratios.  It is 78.1% by volume (and probably the same,  or very close to it, on an [[w:amount of substance]] basis).  It is 75.5% by weight (the terminology often used in science as well as in our everyday lives, though some scientists will insist on using the equivalent phrase &quot;by mass&quot;).
::The dimensionless ratio for &quot;my weight&quot; on Mars compared to &quot;my weight&quot; on Earth is 1.00.
::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] is presumably well aware that if his phrasing is used, a good number of teachers are going to be telling their students that his 1.23456 number is the ratio for their &quot;weight&quot;.   [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 13:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Great, so you agree with me? If not, well, I'm not seeing a complaint. We can perfectly well say &quot;78.1% by volume&quot;, &quot;75.5% by weight&quot;, or &quot;75.5% by mass&quot;. Probably the &quot;by X&quot; part belongs in a footnote though. We can perfectly well say that the 1.23456 number is for weight. While we could equivalently say that it is for acceleration, we'd best not make things needlessly complicated in the '''Wikijunior Solar System''' book.

== the gravitational force of me on the Earth ==

The module currently claims

''For instance, the Earth is very massive and pulls on you very strongly. When you jump up, it quickly pulls you back down to the ground. You are also pulling on the Earth — but your mass is tiny compared to the Earth, so your pull on the Earth is tiny too.''

That seems incorrect. Aren't these 2 forces exactly equal and opposite?

Rather than fixing this example to make it true, but confusing, perhaps we could pick a more appropriate example -- perhaps compare the pull of the earth on you to the pull of a bowling ball on you ? Or the pull of the earth on a bowling ball to the pull of you on a bowling ball? Or the pull of, say, the International Space Station on an astronaut clambering on its outside to the pull of the earth on that same astronaut at the same time?
(Even though that astronaut is nearly &quot;weightless&quot;, his mass is the same as when he is walking on earth, and the force due to Earth's gravity is nearly the same as when he is walking on earth).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:11, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:It is interesting that the term &quot;weightless&quot; is being depreciated for internal use by NASA and other space science researchers.  The ''new'' term that is more commonly used is '''microgravity''', to suggest that gravitational fields do exist in orbital environments, but that the acceleration effects are essentially insignificant in term of the calculations in the experiments.  The ISS does indeed have a gravitational pull on objects around it, but only equivalent of a small asteroid of the same size, roughly, being about 100 meters from one end to the other.  The ISS has high mass density components (like titanium and steel) but also has some interesting structure that would make for some interesting gravitational effects.  This is also supposedly one reason (the huge size of the ISS) why many science researchers are claming that the ISS is useless for some critical experiements:  It is so large that the gravity from the station itself starts to become a factor.  I am not kidding here either.

:BTW, in regards to your question above, when you jump up on the Earth, you pull the Earth back toward you as well as pulling you toward the Earth.  I guess it is a matter of perspective, but the whole Earth does indeed move just a little bit toward you when you come back down.  Maybe the distance is the diameter of a proton, but it is something that is technically measureable.  This is also just a matter of point of view, where both are valid points of view in trying to determine which is correct.  I'm talking scientific point of view, not political point of view here.  Relativity vs. discussions of relatives. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:07, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

== Alternate approach to this module ([[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About gravity and weight]]) ==

This module is indeed a &quot;train wreck&quot; and I am beginning to wonder if it is or will cause more trouble than it's worth. As it stands currently I feel it is out of kilter with the rest of the book, is too long, over-tabulated and introduces more words and concepts than it explains - some of which surely must be inappropriate for the intended audience (e.g. &quot;Astronomerese&quot;).

However, in the spirit of trying to be constructive, I've created [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|an alternate version of this module]] which:

# Tries to stay simple and succinct (although I realise there's room for improvement, e.g. shorter sentence lengths, fewer subclauses, etc);
# Does not refer to mass;
# Does not refer to units;
# Does not &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; that weight changes, but rather that (underline emphases added):
:: &quot;You may've read or heard people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y that your weight would be different on the Moon...&quot;;
:: &quot;[the bathroom scale] would &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y you weighed less than when you weighed yourself with it on the Earth. So people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y your weight has changed...&quot;
:: &quot;it's &lt;u&gt;as if&lt;/u&gt; ... you have no weight...&quot;

If people think this approach is a starter then I think a couple of illustrations or diagrams and perhaps a table of what a bathroom scale would say you weighed on other planets would add interest to the page.

I hope this helps.

== Changed approach to this module ==

I have edited this module. Unlike with the alternate module, I intend to use the word mass. (Notice that &quot;mass&quot; is in the title of this module.) The intention of my edits was to improve the introduction of kilograms and newtons as mass and force (of gravity).

I did remove the references to scientists thinking that &quot;weight&quot; should be force, and astronomers thinking that they should always use the metric/SI system. I also reworded the introduction in a way so that it introduces SI kilograms and newtons, but never introduces pounds; this might need to be changed. (There was never any introduction to stones.)

I also placed the sections about inertia into comments. (The sections did not use the word &quot;inertia&quot;, but referred to difficulty in starting and stopping objects.) Inertia is probably too much for this module. Remember that this is a module that ignores all forces other than gravity; it never introduces the idea, for example, of a force for a person to lift a heavy object. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:07, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== Pluto ==

Pluto is a ''really bad example'' of forces. For one thing, we don't really know all that much about Pluto. It's better for this purpose, to use something more familiar, perhaps the Moon. Or maybe Mars or Venus. The Moon is probably best, because we see it so often, it's ''close.'' And people have actually walked on it

I've edited much of the article before the section that brings up Pluto. I've made the language use &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; instead of &quot;you.&quot; It's more effective, speaking with kids and giving examples of things that humans experience, to not speak to them as if they or we were aliens. &quot;You may fall when you jump, but I only fall if I want to.&quot;

I'm only guessing, I haven't looked yet, and don't have time right now, but I suspect that this may be an issue through the whole book. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 17:26, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

Checking out that Pluto thing, I found out what happened. May 1, 2008, the page was hit by a vandal, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.180.4.34 216.180.4.34]. It wasn't noticed. The next day, the page was again vandalized. That was noticed, and it was reverted. Back to the vandalized version, which was more subtle vandalism. The same editor had been frequently reverting vandalism to the article, but may never have read the whole article. Happens. Anyway, there used to be a full table, which was removed that day in 2008. I'll restore it. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 01:12, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

== The table ==

The table claims that you could kick a ball fast enough to escape the gravity of Phobos. However, several calculations there may have been off for Phobos. Or not. It gets complicated because Phobos is small, and, in general, for small values of how high you could toss a ball, compared to the radius of the planet or moon, if the gravity is cut in half, you can toss it twice as high. But as the speed with which you can toss it increases, and you approach escape velocity, the ball will go higher than just that ratio, until when you reach escape velocity, it would never fall back. I did some searching on this and found sources that confirmed should be easy to throw a baseball with more than escape velocity on Phobos, so it would indeed go into orbit around Mars. But I'm not sure at all about the statements of how high one could jump. It's not a simple calculation from the force of gravity, and I don't have time to do the math and make sure I get it right. So where I left the page may be quite imperfect. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 02:52, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

== Page strategy, and gravity on the moon ==

There's a misleading passage in the current revision of the page (as of this writing).  I'll try my hand at fixing it if someone else doesn't beat me to it (which, let's face it, they might).

We want, I think, a clear and engaging explanation of the major elements of the law of universal gravitation, by going unhurriedly through the sequence
* mass is how much material;
* gravity at a given distance is proportional to the mass of both objects, so at equal distances from the Moon and the Earth, the Moon's gravity is only 1/81 as much as the Earth's; and
* gravity is much stronger (inverse square) when you're closer, so since the moon is much smaller than the Earth, putting you almost four (three and two thirds) times closer to it when you're on its surface than when you're on the Earth's surface, that makes up for a lot of the smaller mass of the Earth.
If there's a reason why that wouldn't work, it's probably that the details get too esoteric, at about the time one has to qualify the second point by saying that it's at the same distance; but that can probably be finessed successfully.

Right now, the progression from point two to point three seems to be a bit rushed, and the part about equal distance isn't clear when point two is made, so that it comes out sounding as if you'd weigh 1/81 as much on the surface of the moon, instead of three and two thirds squared times that.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:32, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks. I think I fixed it. I wasn't trying to generate a mathematical calculation, except for two relationships: the force of gravity between two objects varies directly with the mass of either object, i.e., double either and the force doubles. Half either and the force halves. And then I added to the article the inverse square relationship, that may be within reach of the target age, at least some of the kids. If this were a physics page, I'd go into a lot more detail, it is actually not difficult to explain why you get an inverse square law with various phenomena. See how you like what I did. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:58, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

::That does seem to fix the problem, yes.
::I appreciate that getting drawn into details on WJ can be a slippery slope.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:19, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

Yeah. The trick is to write things that are correct when seen from a more informed perspective, but that also convey simple truths without unnecessary complications. Looking above, there has been a huge flap over &quot;weight.&quot; The problem is that the word &quot;weight,&quot; in ordinary usage, means two different things. It is used to refer to the force applied, and it is used to refer to mass. Good pedagogy starts from what kids already know, and it leads them from that into wider understanding. So demands above that units of weight not be used had completely lost the purpose.
*Kids know that it is harder to throw a heavier object than a lighter one. This isn't an effect of gravity, it's an effect of mass. It is just as hard to throw a baseball on the moon (and we completely neglected the weight or clumsiness of a space suit, perhaps the baseball player is inside a habitat big enough to play baseball in) as it is on the Earth. That is, you should be able to throw the baseball with about the same speed, particularly if you throw it horizontally. It will go further because it will not fall as quickly, that's all. Not because it is easier to throw.
*But &quot;newtons&quot;? We can introduce the unit of force, but we shouldn't depend on it. What we can do is to make clear that when we say &quot;weight,&quot; we are talking about the force of attraction, which depends on two things: the gravity and the mass (as well as the distance from the main source of gravity). But we need to keep in mind that &quot;weight&quot; is used commonly to mean &quot;mass&quot; as well, which is obvious, you know exactly what I mean when I say that a &quot;heavier&quot; ball is harder to throw. We mean that a 20 lb. ball, maybe a bowling ball? is harder to throw than an 8 oz. ball. Those are all units of weight, and we'd measure them with a scale. I measure mass with a scale, all the time. What is actually being measured, of course, is the force of gravity, so I'm assuming, in my weight measurements, a gravitational field of 1 g.
*I wanted to explain what &quot;g&quot; means better, and I wanted to use units of milli-gs, one-thousandth g, in the table. The reason is that it's much easier to read and grasp the whole numbers. We could use centi-g, and the table could express the gravitational field value in percentage of Earth gravitation. So the Earth would be 100% and the Moon would be 16.7%. And Phobos would be 0.5%. It's okay that a value of less than 1 is used for Phobos.... I think I'll do this.
*I think it's inspiring for kids to think of what it's like when there is no apparent gravity. It's an error, though, to say that there is any place with no gravity. Gravity is everywhere, but when there is nothing to resist it, we are in &quot;free fall.&quot; There is gravity acting on satellites in orbit and on the astronauts appearing to float in their space-suits, and on everything inside the International Space Station. But because it is all &quot;falling&quot; together, it seems like there is no gravity, that nothing has weight.
*I remember getting it, I was very young, that a satellite was &quot;falling.&quot; It's just that (thinking of a circular orbit) it falls &quot;around&quot; the Earth. The gravity pulls it down just enough to make it move in a circle around the earth. Obviously, it has to be going pretty fast! And, obviously, if it were moving this fast near the surface, where there is air, air resistance would quickly slow it down. (It would, in fact, get immediately very hot like a meteor, and it would then quickly fall to the ground). But on the moon, an object could be very low and still remain in orbit. (But there is, I believe, a very thin lunar atmosphere that would slow it down, don't know how long that would take.)
*I think most people imagine (without thinking about it) that there is no gravity in space. So we want to educate to dispel this idea. Kids can get that, I believe, easily.
*I think we also tend to imagine that it is dark in space, but maybe kids now, having seen so many bright photos of the space shuttle and ISS, don't have that mis-impression. It's very, very bright, at least in the vicinity of the Earth. Way, way, out, it gets dim as we get very far from the Sun. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:43, 13 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Thanks for improving the horn wikibook ==

I just wanted to thank you for working on the horn wikibook. I started it a bit ago, but don't have much time to devote to it. I check back on it now and then to add/edit and hope that others come and do likewise. I have a few questions and concerns about how you're doing the music though. What software are you using to generate the picture? Since you're releasing the picture into the public domain, could you also release the source file for future editing. I might suggest Lilypond be used for uniformity (and free/open-ness). Also there is some talk (neverending talk unfortunately) of adding music markup capability. Check out [http://www.wikisophia.org wikisophia] for an example of a wikimedia based wiki that uses lilypond for markup. I've thought that if I had more time and if music markup didn't come soon to the wikimedia sites, it would be nice to have a wiki solely devoted to the horn or music that allowed music markup. Anyways keep it up!

      <comment>/* My New Computer Randomly Restarts */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is for developing sections that will eventually go into the book [[How To Build A Computer]] (only if there is enough material present to justify a new subpage).

== Troubleshooting ==

You just finished building your computer, you turn it on, and it doesn't work. This section helps you in case this happens.

=== The drives act strange ===

Make sure the IDE/ATA cable isn't longer than 18 inches (46 cm).

=== I pressed the power button and nothing happened ===

This could be due to a variety of reasons

* You forgot to connect the power button
* The power cable is loose
* The power is out
* The motherboard is grounded out
* You forgot (on certain motherboards) to connect the 12V 4-PIN cable to the motherboard.

=== My New Computer Randomly Restarts ===

* Bad UPS, check the voltage rails for your UPS
* Insufficient cooling of components, especially CPU

=== My New Computer Randomly Shuts Down / Crashes ===
* You have overclocked it above what the processor can do at it's current vcore voltage. Increase the vcore voltage.
* An internal/external cable is loose.

=== RMA ===

You found your problem component using the above sections, and you need to get a replacement for a part you bought online. This is known as an RMA(Return Merchandise Authorization). This is usually done through either the manufacturer or the store where you bought the item from.

== Modding + Decoration ==
{{Wikipediapar||case modding}}

So you don't just want to make a computer, you want to show it off. Or maybe you want to do something creative with your computer.

== Optimizing the System ==

If you are using a Windows system, you'll probably want to remove useless features and 'tweak' your system. Searching the internet for 'Windows Tweaks' will throw up a load of tweaks. Be warned. Don't do anything crazy and if you are scared-DON'T DO IT!

= Build a Laptop =
Few people know this but let me tell you a little secret- It IS possible to build a laptop/notebook computer. Be warned-It IS more difficult than building a desktop. Heres how:

== Getting Parts ==

Here are the parts you will need to make your pride and joy. But before you rush out to get it all, please scroll down to my DISCLAIMER. The parts are:

[http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=barebone+laptop+notebook&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle A Barebone Notebook]

A compatible Processer (search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

A compatible Hard Drive (search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

Some RAM (search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

WiFi Card (optional unless you have a Centrino notebook)(search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

== Building It ==

[http://www.overclockers.com/tips1195/ THIS SITE] has a good guide on how to make the 'book. (I'm WAY too lazy to type it myself)

== Disclaimer ==

1. I HATE Going out shopping. If you do too, I have provided links to all the parts to buy online. However:
a) These may not ship to your area
b) I AM NOT advertising/selling/recommending all these parts!!!
2. If anything goes wrong I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
3. Operating System (OS) installation is the same as on a desktop
4. Please ensure you read and understand
a)These instructions/instructions on links
b)The Desktop building instructions in ths book
5. DO NOT attempt if you have never done a desktop before
6. Most important:
a)Slag your friends saying- &quot;I can build a laptop computer and you can't-HaHa&quot;
b)Enjoy your shiny new handbuilt laptop :)
7. If all goes wrong just [http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=cheap+laptops&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle BUY ONE] (see 1b)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book has been written as an aid to learning Welsh (''Cymraeg'' or ''y Gymraeg'', pronounced {{IPA|[kəmˈrɑːɨɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ə ɡəmˈrɑːɨɡ]}}). It is a Celtic language originating in Wales (''Cymru''), but is now only spoken by around a quarter of the Welsh population, as English has started to become the norm. It is also spoken in the Welsh settlement in the Chubut Valley of Patagonia, Argentina. There are also speakers of Welsh throughout the world, most notably in the rest of Great Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia.
Although coming from Wales, the large majority of the population can speak English. Welsh is spoken more in North Wales, but it is a legal requirement to satisfy both Welsh and English speakers and provide services in both languages throughout Wales. Most people in South Wales cannot speak Welsh, although it is encouraged in schools. The vast majority of children in Wales know some Welsh, and many are educated via the language, even if this is not their mother tongue. If visiting Wales, English will suffice; likewise Spanish is the primary language of Patagonia. One of the oldest European languages surviving, it is well worth learning if you require a job in Wales working in public services, or living here.

Due to the increasing use of the English language the numbers of Welsh speakers had been declining for decades.  However, following a number of measures, including the introduction of the Welsh Language Act in 1993, Welsh has enjoyed a strong revival in recent years and now officially has an equal status with English in the public sector in Wales. It is now the most widely spoken Celtic language.

An Indo-European language, Welsh belongs to the Brythonic branch of Celtic Languages, which includes Breton and Cornish. This branch is also named &quot;P-Celtic&quot;, because the &quot;qu&quot; consonant of Indo-European origin became a &quot;p&quot;. In the other branch, including Irish and Scots Gaelic, this consonant kept the same sound, giving rise to the name &quot;Q-Celtic&quot;. This is shown on the table to the right:

==Introduction to Welsh==

The following should be completed before beginning the Welsh course. You will learn how to pronounce Welsh, learn some basic greetings, count to 10, and learn a little bit about the grammar that you will face when learning Welsh.

My name is Lilious. I'm a plant biologist working on root development using molecular biology techniques as well as fluorescence microscopy and i'm thinking to write about some of this subjects in wikibooks. I opened recently the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Plant_Sciences | Wikiversity of Plant Sciences]] to replace the former wikiversity of Botany which was empty. 
I plan to : developp the existing wikibook of [[Botany]] and set up the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Plant_Sciences | Wikiversity of Plant Sciences]] to provide :
* free of right teaching material made by wikiversity teachers
* links to some teaching ressources available on the web for students who want to learn more
* links to online ressources for plant scientists, such as databases, journals, tools for molecular biology, imaging, freewares... This ressource should be good enough to become a reference portal that can attract academic plant scientists to the wiki-world and incitate them to participate.
* web-based bibliography review with references, made and continuously updated by the wikiversity community. This will done on topics of particular interest in order to provide material to write specific sections of the wikibook of [[Botany]]
* Upload my personal reviews on fluorescence et genetic techniques, root gravitropism, hormones, lateral root development both as an online version as well as a pdf version.


I created this personal page by cut/paste from [[User:Cormaggio]] and [[:w:User:Seth_Ilys]] pages which are well formated. So some links might not be relevant to me and will disappear soon

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note: Throughout the chapter, we will provide several sample hands with which to illustrate the various rules and strategies of five card draw. Each example is independent of any prior hand. Thus, rules regarding the rotation of dealership, order of play, and other such logistical facts will not apply, unless explicitly stated.''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Welcome to the table, everyone,&quot; Alex says as he sits himself down. &quot;So, what kind of game are we playing tonight? Five-ten? Ten-twenty?&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Ten-twenty sounds alright to me,&quot; Dana answers, and everyone nods in agreement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Well, I guess I'll just start as the button, if no one objects,&quot; Alex continues as he shuffles up the deck of cards ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What the heck is going on here? You might be thinking, &quot;I thought the kind of game was five card draw!&quot; So what's with the talk about ten and twenty? And what's a button, anyway?

==Overview==
Five card draw is a fun and thoughtful game of strategy, skill, and - as with all card games - a bit of luck. It derived from several card games invented in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, but truly flourished as game in the United States in the 1800s. It was a particularly popular game on the American Frontier, as it could be played with merely a deck of cards and anyone who was willing to risk their money at the table.

==Rules of Play==
* Deck: Standard 52 Card Deck
* Maximum number of players: 6
* Wild Cards: None
 
Five card draw is a very simple game to learn and to play with friends. It requires 2 players, but 3 or more are recommended, with 7 players being the maximum. For the purposes of this chapter, we have drafted five fictional poker players, Alex, Ben, Chris, Dana, and Ellen, who will demonstrate much of the rules and strategies of five card draw. Let's return to our earlier anecdote.

When Alex asked what kind of game they were going to play, he was actually asking what the size of the bets were going to be (also known as '''the [[../Betting|betting]] structure'''.) You can't just bet a random amount in a poker game - you have to bet according to predetermined betting increments. As you probably noticed, these betting amounts are called out in sets of two: &quot;five-ten&quot; and &quot;ten-twenty.&quot; This is because in poker games with multiple rounds of betting - including five card draw - the betting stakes are raised in subsequent rounds.

Since everyone agreed on &quot;ten-twenty&quot;, this means that for the first round of betting, if a player chooses to raise his opponent, he must increase his pot bet by $10, and by $20 in the second round. We'll get to the actual stages of betting later, but for now simply know what a &quot;ten-twenty game&quot; implies about the stakes at the table.

Continuing on with our anecdote, we will note now the general &quot;set up&quot; that goes into each hand. At the very beginning of play, one player is chosen to be the '''dealer''' - in this case, Alex. The dealer is also known as the '''button'''. This is more or less derived from the fact that, in order to keep track of who dealt last and who was to deal next in the older days, a brass button was handed from dealer to dealer. Over time, this tradition has evolved, and many decorative items are used in place of a plain old button to denote who is next to deal. At most casinos, there is only one house dealer at a poker table, and thus the &quot;button&quot; is merely symbolic in nature, though as we see in the next section it still has an important function in the game.

Before any actual cards are dealt, two initial '''antes''' must be placed into the pot in order to encourage play: the '''small blind''' and the '''big blind'''. The small blind is equal to ''one-half'' of the smaller of the two bets in a game. Thus, in a $10/$20 game, the small blind would be $5. This is placed into the pot by the player to the immediate left of the dealer. The big blind, as you can probably guess, is equal to 100% of the smaller bet. Thus, in a $10/$20 game, the big blind would be $10. This is placed into the pot by the player to the immediate left of the small blind. In the case of an unchanging house dealer, these bets are placed by the players to the left of the button. In tournament play, the blinds are consistently raised at set time intervals (usually after a certain number of hands have been played) as a means of speeding up the elimination of players. (We will discuss strategies involving the blinds later in this chapter.)

Once the blinds have been placed on the table, Alex will deal five cards, one at a time, face down to each player (to do otherwise would rename the game!), including himself. He then places the remainder of the deck - called the ''draw pile'' - face down near him. Each player now takes up his '''hand''' for examination. Hand ranking is discussed in the [[Poker:Basics|Basics]] chapter, for now we will continue with our discussion of the procedures for playing a hand.

Betting begins with the player to the left of the big blind - in our case, Ben was the small blind and Chris was the big blind, so play begins with Dana. Dana has three betting options at her disposal:

*Dana may simply '''fold''' her hand. That is, she places her cards in a discard pile (still face down) and is no longer eligible to win the hand.
*Dana may '''call'''. To call a bet at any time, a player must match the highest bet placed thus far on the table. Since Chris's $10 big blind is the highest bet, it will cost Dana $10 in order to call.
*Dana may '''raise'''. To raise a bet, a player must exceed the highest bet placed by one betting increment. Since Chris's $10 big blind is the highest bet, Dana must pay $20 to raise.

Let's assume Dana folds her hand (another name for folding is '''mucking'''.) Play then continues to Ellen. Ellen has the same three options as Dana. Let's assume she chooses to call, and Alex chooses to call as well.

Ben, as the small blind, has the same three choices as the other players have had. However, since he has already invested $5 into the pot, and he only has to ''match'' the highest bet placed, Ben would only have to place $5 more into the pot in order to call, and only $15 in order to raise. Ben decides his hand is no good and folds.

For Chris, the big blind, the situation is somewhat different. If someone had chosen to raise the pot, he would have had the same options as the other players: he could fold, call the bet, or raise his bet on top of the previous raise (also known as '''re-raising'''.) However, since no one has raised the pot, Chris can choose to '''check''' - he has already matched the highest bet on the table, and so he can remain in the pot without having to put in any additional money. Chris chooses to check, and now the round of discarding begins.

Each player has the option of discarding up to 3 cards from his or her hand. In games with 5 or less players, the rules can allow for the discarding of up to 4 cards - this is up to the players at the table. A player can of course choose to discard 0 cards if they feel their hand is strong enough. Once a player has discarded his or her cards, the dealer deals them a number of cards from the draw pile equal to what they have discarded.

A second round of betting now ensues. As was stated earlier, the minimum bet is now $20. The first player to act is the closest player to the dealer's left who is still in the hand. In our case, Ben the small blind has folded, and so Chris is the first to act. Since no new money has entered the pot, Chris elects to check. Ellen is the next to act, and she bets $20. Alex calls her $20, and Chris folds his hand. Alex and Ellen then turn over their hands, and the best hand wins the pot (a whopping $75, if you weren't keeping track!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This phrase &quot;To ever be used by a class in a real school the book must adhere to set standards&quot; is perjorative.  Who determined that independent schools, community schools, and home schools aren't 'real'?  There are better, more neutral, ways to say this idea.
(Heath) [[User:66.207.89.82|66.207.89.82]] 15:01, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
Not only does the phrase exclude a number of types of schools it also does the same to types of learners.  What about those of us that have long since graduated from &quot;school&quot; but still see ourselves as learners.  Does mean we should simply vanish.

== International standards ==

When I work on [[Algebra 2|this]], I have to try to decide how to interpret different standards to fit in the mix. I don't see why we need to have to coordinate books with standards that may or may not be actually good. I can testify, for instance, how standards lead to very poor academics in school. They do not interest most students, and those that do get interested is because the teacher/s lead them into further exploration. So I say, why not arrange books by interest levels, not by standards? Seems most sensible. Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:18, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
:I'm sorry, Laleena, but I can't really agree, much as I wish I could. What the standards provide is a minimum, a level of factuality and verifiability, so that an educator using our texts (or any text) will have a basic level of trust in the materials he or she is using to teach. We &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; write to that minimum standard to be accepted. Without that minimum, we cannot be used for teaching and the whole thing becomes a pointless exercise. However: Nothing says that we can't exceed that minimum, and it is there that we hopefully can do better than the main stream. All the same, a text, even as flexible and fluid a text as WB, cannot inspire the way a teacher can. WB can, under the hands of a suitable teacher, inspire a class to new heights as it researches outside the classroom to find material to add to the text, to make a palpable contribution to the next class and to the future. There is no text that can make a mediocre teacher any good. What we have to do is meet the standards, exceed them where possible, and we have no choice but to trust the teachers to make the magic from what we can provide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is the alternate formats really nescesarry, why wouldn't you just add the formats under a new heading?

== Mmm? ==

I'm not sure to understand what you are saying, but if you feel it could benefit, go ahead. -- [[User:Icez]]

== formats ==
what I am saying is that why would I say:

Outline format:

Two colum format:

Alternate formats:
   writing on your hand:
   
   psychic note taking:

instead of:

Outline format:

Two colum format:

Writing on your hand: no that is note a good idea that's still cheating

Pyschic note taking:


(and no, I wouldn't actually do those... unless I found a way that worked really well)

I think that what &quot;alternate formats&quot; are is very subjective.  Any format could be considered a &quot;main format&quot;, any format could also be considered an &quot;alternate format&quot;

== Yeah ==

Most of the formats are more useful for some kinds of subjects (like history, math, etc..).

== Re-organization of book ==

Hi!
I found this book by accident.
There is a recommended format for Wikibooks.
I thought it might be good idea to re-organize the material into this form.

Should we merge [[Keeping your writing notebook - how to use it]] into [[Note Taking]]?

A &quot;god&quot; by definition is &quot;that which ultimately calls the shots&quot;.  The human propensity to ultimately rely on something as a basis for judgment is universal and inescapable.  As it is true in every individual life, so it is true in societies as a whole.  Some source gives the basis for meaning and the interpretation of reality.  

Some countries are very explicit in decreeing their basis, which is religious by nature.  Israel is a good example in that it claims Judaism as its &quot;official&quot; religion.  Laws, holidays, family structures, education, etc.  stem from that faith.  So it is with England.  England claims to be &quot;Christian&quot; by religion and Anglican by denomination.  In Spain, you cannot hold political office unless you are a professed Catholic.  These countries and many others declare by edict or law what the religious perspective is, though that in and of itself does not necessarily demand individual  subserviance.  

The bottom line is that every society has a god as its foundation.  It is inescapable.  There is an inevitable &quot;theology&quot; that serves as an ethical infrastructure.  America originally was an assumed and decreed Christian nation, though the individual states had substantial autonomy.  The state of Delaware originally demanded that all elected and appointed officials of the state believed in Jesus Christ and held to the Old and New Testaments.  That is perhaps one of the most pointedly self concious civil requirements available in modern history.  

However, recognizing that all societies have rudimentary religious foundations does not imply that these foundations are theistic.  The former Soviet Union had an atheistic basis.  This too is a theological perspective.  In philosophical and theological terms, every belief is either theonomic or autonomous (God-centered or man-centered).  There is no escape and there are no other options.  

For instance, in America we talk freely and routinely about liberty.  Liberty is synonomous with freedom.  The Declaration of Independence held that rights were originally given by God and therefore, it was wrong for man to take them away.   Notice the theological basis for this position.  God was the giver, man was the recipient.  All through American history there were laws made, wars fought and ethics derived from that basic and foundational theological position.

In France, after the American Revolution, there was a similar revolution.  This revolution too was based on a theological perspective.  This perspective, developed and purported by Robiespierre, made man his own God and concommitantly pushed Christianity out of the picture.  It was a horrible experiment, yet it was clearly theologically oriented. 
Consequently, it is not a matter of theocracy vs no theocracy;  it is a matter of which theocracy.  The term &quot;theocracy&quot;, like so many other terms in philosophy and theology, is not a happy one. Nevertheless, the term is used repeatedly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adding a Pre-made Screensaver'''

You can simply use the screensavers Windows XP comes bundled with, if you wish. To use one of these screensavers, follow these steps:

# Go to the desktop.
# Right click and select &quot;Properties&quot; from the menu.
# A window should appear.
# Click on the &quot;Screen Saver&quot; tab at the top.
# Click on the drop-down menu.
# Pick a screensaver!

'''NOTE:''' If you want to edit something about the screensaver, click the settings button.

'''Making Your Own Screensaver'''

Want to make your own screensaver? Ok. This is very easy with the amount of free tools out there. I would recommend:

* [http://www.devsoft.ch/products/3DScreenCreator/download.php 3D Screen Creator] - Create your own 3D screensavers.

'''Fennel''' is both a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] and a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

As a spice, the dried seeds are ground for use. Fennel smells somewhat like [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Anise|Anise]] and [[Cookbook:Liquorice|liquorice]].

Fennel can be used in [[Cookbook:Pizza Sauce|pizza sauce]].

The small seeds, similar in size and appearance to [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds, are used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cooking]] (eg as an ingredient in [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]) or a constituent of [[Cookbook:Pan Masala|pan masala]], where their digestive properties are exploited.

The leaves are finely divided and feathery, like [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]. The herb is frequently used with [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]].

[[Cookbook:Florence Fennel|Florence fennel]], a cultivar of the plant, is grown for its bulb, which is used as a vegetable. As a vegetable, the stalks are used. A typical use would be [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]].

'''Pan masala''' is a mixture of spices such as cardamom, lime, menthol, clear catechu, betel nuts and other flavours. It is often eaten at the end of a meal to aid digestion and sweeten the breath. The mixture has a mild stimulating effect.

'''Florence fennel''' is variety of fennel that has been bred to grow a bulbous stem, which can be used as a vegetable. It has a crunchy texture and a flavour between [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and [[Cookbook:Aniseed|aniseed]].

The bulb can be eaten raw, in a salad, [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] as a side vegetable, or included as an ingredient in dishes such as [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]].</text>

{{spice}}

'''Liquorice''' or '''Licorice''' is a [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]] and [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]]. It smells somewhat like [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]].

Liquorice flavour is most commonly available as a liquid extract. The extract is produced by boiling liquorice root, then evaporating most of the water to leave a sweet syrup. The extract is widely used to make confectionery, especially black liquorice candies and liquorice allsorts. It can also be prepared as a tea.

Liquorice is also used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking, in broths and in foods simmered with soy sauce.

Liquorice increases blood pressure, is an expectorant (cough remedy), and acts as a mild laxative.

Hello! As anyone of us may have experienced, tech support can be a terrifying experience. However, it doesn't have to be a nightmare. In this book, I will be explaining to you how you can get optimum benefits from calling tech support. Enjoy!

Golden Rule:
* '''Tech support is trying to help you.''' Don't immediately ask for the supervisor, at least let them try but if all else fails call the supervisor.

==Before you call==
''&quot;On two occasions, I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot; - Charles Babbage''

* Allow extra time for being on hold - have some cleaning, organizing, or other non-brain intensive work to be done?  Grab a headset and go to work while you wait.
* Don't worry if you are '''running software for the first time'''. Chances are, it's a small configuration problem.
* '''Know what kind of tech support they offer'''. Some call centers/tech support do not provide all levels of service. There are some that only take the calls and the escalate them to another group. There are others that try to solve everything with the first call. Don't get mad if the support person tells you they have to transfer you to another department.
* '''Only call for yourself''' and never for a friend. Chances are the friend is better off calling for themselves as they probably know more about the situation.
* Only call when '''you are at your computer''' and ready to do what the tech support assistant says. It will make it easier for the both of you.
* '''Use common sense.''' Too many callers do not. Here's a quick checklist to run down:
**Is the device on?
**Is everything plugged in?
**Are any cables loose?
**Have you tried rebooting the machine?

*A '''Lack''' of planning on your part, does '''NOT''' constitute an emergency on theirs.

==Calling==
* First off, '''speak clearly''', and do not shout into the phone. If you want the assistant on the other end to be able to help you, you really should be speaking in a neutral (not yelling but not very soft) and calm mode.
* Each time you call, '''tell them your name'''. Just because you may have called a few hours ago, doesn't mean they remember your name.
* '''Present a question, not a statement.'''
* Whenever you call, '''get to the point''' and don't give details that don't have anything to do with your situation. Also, don't brag, and don't talk about anything else.
* '''Don't be arrogant.''' Remember, if you have to resort to calling tech support, why claim to be the smart guy?
* '''They know how important your e-mail is.''' You don't have to describe it.
* '''The tech support assistant may not always be right, but the error messages are pretty much always right.''' Tell them the error message exactly.
*'''Jump through the hoops. Be patient''' Tech support has questions and steps that are laid out ahead of time to save time to cover all bases.  If you think you know what the problem is, you might be right and they'll get there eventually.  If you're wrong, they'll fix your issue right away.  Plus, if your issue needs to escalated to another department, all the basic questions will be answered which will speed up your resolution.
* '''Don't say things like &quot;I'm so stupid.&quot;''' They could probably infer that. 
* '''DON'T LIE!''' They probably will find out.  They have all heard, &quot;Nothing has changed&quot; so often when it has not been true that when you offer this they immediately know it to not be true.  If they ask and you say &quot;nothing has changed&quot; they might believe you.
* When you see an error, '''write it down'''. If you write it then, you can tell them the exact error, and they could help you based on the error.  On Windows computers, it is possible to click (highlight) the error window and hit &lt;i&gt;Alt+PrintScreen&lt;/i&gt;.  This will copy the error message to the clipboard, from which you can paste into a document and print it for reference.  Hit &lt;i&gt;PrintScreen&lt;/i&gt; for the whole screen.  When tech support is across the network, you can paste the error graphic directly into an email message.
* '''Think about the priority''' of the call. If the error is affecting everyone at your business and is causing a big loss, that would be considered a top priority issue.
* '''Get a ticket number'''. Most call centers track calls with numbered 'tickets'. It always helps to write down the ticket number.
* '''Don't tell tech support how to solve the problem'''. It doesn't help if you tell tech support how to fix your problem. If you are calling then chances are your solution doesn't work.
* '''Tell tech support if there was someone working on your computer'''. Let the support person know if there was another technical person working on the same problem. Quote a ticket number if you have one.
*'''Don't Assume''', especially when talking about internet based items such as email or a website. Don't assume the problem is with the company. Chances are it is a setting, old cookie, or firewall issue on your computer, or issue with your ISP. Remember, especially if it is a website: if the site is down, they're losing money, and losing money is bad. A company will do anything possible to get back up and running ASAP. How long you wait on hold is a good indication.
*'''If you've forgotten your password''', try looking for a 'Forgot your password' link. It may save you a wait on hold.
*If '''Hardware failed''', do not blame anyone.  '''All''' hardware will eventually fail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Truly Removing Log Off User ==

We all know that WIN+R will launch the Run dialog. And if you didn't know that before, you do now. It's an easy way to launch programs in your path or Web pages (provided they start with either &quot;http&quot; or &quot;www&quot;). You can make a shortcut to this command easily in Windows XP, but first you need to have the default Start Menu view enabled. Once that's done, simply drag &amp; drop the Run icon from the menu to your desktop (which is akin to a &quot;cradle to the grave&quot; operation). Rename it at will. While we're on the subject of XP Professional's Start Menu, if you wanna get rid of the Help and Logoff icons, TweakUI may not do the trick. But there are 2 methods to do the same used Windows Xp's built-in tools.&lt;br&gt;

===1) Using group policies:===
Launch gpedit.msc (from the Run command line). Be careful what you toggle in here; you could very well deny access to essential Windows features. Select ''User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar &gt; Remove [This] menu from Start Menu''. Of course, [This] could be &quot;Help,&quot; &quot;Logoff,&quot; or any other menu component. Note that the &quot;F1&quot; key will still respond to your call.

===2) Using registry===
[[Image:NoLogOff.png|right|thumb|200px|Screenshot of removing/disabling logoff]]

Type REGEDIT on your run dialog box. Now browse to the following location in the window that opens up.
'''HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer'''. On the right side you may see a [[value]] named '''NoLogOff'''. Double click on it and change its value to '''1'''
If you don't see the '''NoLogOff''' [[value]] then create a '''[[STRING]]''' [[value]] and name it as '''NoLogOff'''; now change its [[data]] to '''1'''&lt;br&gt;
You may need to reboot.

== Kill the Passport Balloon ==
Too many people are tricked into believing that you need to sign up for a Passport account when you get Windows XP. Wonderful job the marketing folks did, eh? Well, if you don't want to sign up for an account, nobody is forcing you to. At least, not yet. Are you tired of being reminded about signing up? Fire up REGEDIT.EXE and find your way to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ MessengerService. You'll see a &quot;PassportBalloon&quot; binary value in the right-hand pane. Double-click to open it. Now, in the resulting &quot;Edit Binary Value&quot; dialog, press the Delete key and enter: &quot;0a&quot; (that's a zero, sans quotes). This will effectively set the reminder counter to 10 and you won't be bothered with it again. Don't want the Windows Messenger to pop up when you launch Outlook Express? In the Registry, get to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Outlook Express and either edit or add a DWORD Value: &quot;Hide Messenger&quot; (sans quotes). Set this to &quot;2&quot; and you'll be good to go. Thanks to X-Setup (XTEQ.COM) for providing an easier way to get this done. Within that program, you can right-click on a plug-in and select &quot;Information&quot; for details and script code.

== Kill the Animated Search Character ==
When I first saw the default search pane in Windows XP, my instinct was to return it to its classic look; that puppy had to go. Of course, I later discovered that a doggie door is built into the applet. Click &quot;Change preferences&quot; then &quot;Without an animated screen character.&quot; If you'd rather give it a bare-bones &quot;Windows 2000&quot; look and feel, fire up your Registry editor and navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Explorer \ CabinetState. You may need to create a new string value labeled &quot;Use Search Asst&quot; and set it to &quot;no&quot; (sans quotes in each case). Before you go that far, let me make you aware of two things. First, you can accomplish the same task via the new TweakUI (available for download at WINDOWSXP.COM). Second, there's a nice benefit to the new Search Companion in Internet Explorer 6.0 (at least, with Microsoft Office's spell checker installed). Launch your browser and tap the F3 key. Now, enter your query, intentionally misspelling a keyword. Look at that! A red squiggly! Right-click on the word and select an appropriate replacement (if necessary). How's that for helpful?

== Strange errors ==

From time to time, you will encounter some persistent errors or issues.  The best way to resolve them is to try searching for that error on a search engine.   More often than not, you may encounter the result on the first link (especially if you search by the error message), or otherwise have enough information to find the correct path. 

While contacting the local computer expert may seem tempting, remember that they want to do work as well.  As always, search before asking.

==Three Phase Alternating Current==

In North America, three phase alternating current is generated and transmitted using three conductors to industry, commercial buildings and to a group of houses.  Some older installations use 2400/4160Y three-phase systems, but most currently use 7200/12470Y.
Near a group of houses is a step down transformer wired in a &quot;Wye&quot; or &quot;Star&quot; configuration. Each individual house receives one of these three phases.  The neutral conductor comes from the middle tap of the &quot;Wye.&quot;  Other houses receive different phases which are balanced throughout the group. One 7200 volt line feeds a transformer to a house, which then creates two hot legs and one neutral 120/240.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:3PhaseWaveform.gif]] --&gt;

In a house, the breaker panel provides connections between the two phases and the neutral conductor.  Most of the household outlets are connected between one of the &quot;hot&quot; [[Electric Motors And Generators/Single-phase|phases]] and the neutral with a safety breaker permitting a maximum of 15 amperes.  For the larger loads, such as the oven and the clothes dryer, the breaker panel connects across the two hot phases to provide 240 volts, limited to a maximum of 40 amperes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Summery:'''

AT&amp;T was making and selling Unix and the University of California Berkley was making and giving away their own patches for Unix.  A group of ex-Berkley students took the patches and formed a complete system and began selling it, trouble didn't start until they began advertising with a slogan of &quot;It's Unix!&quot;.

A lawsuit resulted, which dragged in the University of California due to it's releasing the code in the first place.  The case went on for a long time, slowing the development of the BSD projects that had begun as completely open source operating systems.

It was LSU versus UoCB and BSDi.

During the case it was found that a large portion of the code in Unix was actually BSD code stripped of it's license, thus breaking the terms of the license and placing LSU in an uncomfortable position.  A settlement was made in which the whole of the results were kept from the public for several years, but for the most part freed the BSD code and any who use it from any legal action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==use of tables and metric==

The standard for ingredient lists is what you see everywhere. If really want to change that, please bring it up on the [[Talk:Cookbook|Cookbook talk page]].

This would obviously be a tremendous effort.

The end result would be more complex to edit. I think lots of people are going to have trouble with tables. Sometimes the tables are worth the trouble ([[Cookbook:Fish]] and [[Cookbook:Smoke Point]]), but not for simple ingredient lists.
This is especially so if there is no additional benefit, such as database lookups on the ingredients.

The standard for units has been to put the converted version in parentheses. This lets you know which version is primary and which might be a crude approximation. Since we can now link to the unit names, there is very little point in having the converted units. This is especially true when the primary units are Queen Anne (USA), because the conversion to metric is very easy.

:Hi Albert,

:I'd really like to use a standardized way of presenting the ingredients. It would be helpful if you could point me to a page that is laid out the way you think is best.  I went over, for example, to [[Cookbook:Pasta recipes]] and went down the line; I didn't see anybody that followed the convention that I understand you to be talking about.

:Some recipes used Queen Anne, others metric. I like the idea of showing both: it makes it easier, at least for me, to follow.

:Just to make sure I'm being clear, I'm not pushing back on your revert (it was really just an experiment), but a model ingredient list for me to follow would be a good thing.

:[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 14:27, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::There simply aren't too many recipes that supply both units, but [[Cookbook:Coq au Vin]] is one example. Despite being a &quot;French&quot; recipe, the Queen Anne units came first. Metric, being added later, gets parentheses to indicate that it is a conversion. Ugh, it should be &quot;mL&quot;, not &quot;ml&quot;. (there is no metric unit named &quot;ml&quot;) Note the inaccuracy of the conversion. (20% more salt, 20% less pepper, 10% more chicken, 12% less wine)

::So, if you really want to supply both, that's the existing practice.

::A much more serious problem is amounts given by mass. Normal cooks in the USA can easily deal with Queen Anne volume, large metric volume (100 mL increments), °F temperatures, baking chocolate by the ounce, and meat by the pound (decimal or fraction, not pounds and ounces). Smart cooks can convert metric to Queen Anne to handle small volumes, and can estimate kg of meat by eye. Most cooks would give up. For non-meat items given by mass though, a conversion involving density is required! Households in the USA simply do not own kitchen scales. Probably a scale or balance could be had for $30 from an exotic cooking store. It is probably more common to own a zester, marble rolling pin, melon baller, springform pan, pressure cooker, 2-part angelfood cake pan... In fact my mom, an expert cook, does indeed have all those things and no scale or balance.

::I generally keep things simple and easy to edit, with plenty of links. (examples: [[Cookbook:Saffron Rice]], [[Cookbook:Jambalaya]]) There is a template recipe linked off the bottom of the main page that you can use if you want to get fancy, but it looks really dumb unless you know obscure stuff like the number of Calories in the dish. Be sure to delete the unused sections (often &quot;Warnings&quot;) if you use this template. I find it easier to start from a recipe that is similar to the one I'm adding, especially if the categories will be the same.

::Watch out for recipes using Imperial units, which are 20% larger than Queen Anne units. This is a common problem with UK recipes, and yet another reason for metric conversions to be seriously inaccurate. If you go through the cookbook converting recipes without great care, you might create some additional confusion.

::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:35, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)


:Once again I find that the world gets so much more complicated as you look more closely at it. :-)

:I'm not sure I'm convinced that the accuracy you assume (10% more of this, 12% less of that) is justified. Right now I'm looking at the nutritional label on a bag of sushi rice that I have. It says 160 Calories per serving; not 150 or 170? And the bag contains &quot;Approx. 25&quot; servings. What we're talking about here is the difference between a 'cook' and a person who follows recipes, and why the phrase &quot;correct the seasonings&quot; shows up so often in cookbooks. Of course, I'm not disputing your basic point.

:My motivation was in part the link I put in the Wikipedia's Sushi page to this article. It's the old question of whether recipes should appear in the the Encyclopedia; my opinion is &quot;Occasionally, but ususally not&quot;. This one is sufficiently complicated that I was using a 'one copy of a piece of information' theory. Perhaps I'll change my mind in a few days and copy it back. But in the mean time it's better for me to have one copy rather than try to keep up the changes in two places. Particularily because there's some weird war going on in History of sushi comparing ''sushi'' to ''pizza'' from ''Pizza Hut''. I'm waiting for the rice dust to settle.

:But the new link was also a motivation for the different units. I'm assuming that people from many parts of the world will look at it, and (I hope) make good adjustments.

[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 18:43, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Albert,

I adapted the recipe, trying to follow the ''Coq au Vin'' model. See what you think.

One other thing to note. It's important to be careful when reverting articles.  :-)  As a side effect to removing the table, there were also formatting bugs introduced back into the article (there were two sections in the ToC marked &quot;1&quot; because the '===' had been incorrect), and two or three other improvements were lost.  I fixed that by reverting the reversion, and then making the measurement changes from there.

[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 13:47, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

That looks good. I like the way you adjusted the larger metric conversions to match the &quot;2 mL&quot; one, keeping the error under 5%. Probably this trick should be documented somewhere.

As for the other changes reverted, they didn't seem significant. I generally find the ToC to be ugly and useless, so I didn't notice the double occurance of &quot;1&quot;. I only saw minor font changes and the addition or removal of the lines that go with 2nd level headers, none of which seemed all that significant. Disabling the ToC (with &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page) would have solved the problem.

[[User:Redlentil]] and I have been going around lowercasing ingredients as we edit pages. It's some sort of pet peeve for him I think (&quot;my bete noire&quot; he says), and a minor aesthetic issue for me. If you really think it looks better the other way, then that's another thing that ought to be discussed on the Cookbook talk page.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:19, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] instructions ==

Problem with the new instructions:

The rice is in a colander to drain. I add konbu to a pot (the one with vinegar dressing?), along with some saki. I boil water. (in a teapot I guess) For some reason, I remove the konbu from my pot as the seemingly-unrelated water boils. This leaves me with either a pot of saki or saki+vinegar+sugar+salt. Something simmers for 20 minutes... but I have two pots and a colander full of rice now, so I'll take a guess that you mean the water. (nothing else is cooking)

The 2nd and 3rd steps now must be read together. If they are not, the dressing might need to be transferred from a mixing bowl to the saucepan.

I think you should revert that and try again.

Leaving the [[Cookbook:Hangari|hangari]] link would be a good idea too. Probably both spellings are good, given the difficulty in making up romanized versions of Japanese words.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:30, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I added some extra pointers in so that people won't get mixed up, boil water in their teapot, and endup eating all that dry rice.
::Honestly, I'm still lost. Suppose I put my rice in the colandar to drain. Now, I wish to boil the konbu. Is it optional, required, or prohibited that I use the water from cooking the rice? Must I add the rice back into the pot before or after dealing with the konbu? (perhaps it does not matter?) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:29, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:As for hangiri: you know, I've asked around on the Wikipedia site, and what I'm hearing is that it is not just a transliteration error. Just as 'sake' seems to be misspelled in the Cookbook as 'saki' (see, for example, the disambiguation page in the Wikipedia). I need to say that I don't speak a word of Japanese, so I'm relying on people who either are Japanese or have lived in Japan for extended periods. Could be there are different ways to transliterate it.
::Example: Japanese has several sounds that map onto the English 'L' and 'R'. It's sort of a different axis though, so one Japanese speaker could say all of those Japanese sounds in a way that would be 'R' while another might make them sound like 'L'. This is why Japanese natives struggle with the L-R distinction. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:29, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== egg sizes ==

The sushi omelet recipe (at [[Cookbook:Sushi]], but perhaps should be separate) specifies &quot;4 extra-large Eggs&quot;.
Well, wouldn't you know, this differs from country to country.

The &quot;USDA Large&quot; egg is about the same as the &quot;EU size M&quot; egg. (both being the common choice AFAIK) So, for normal recipes, it is best to avoid specifying egg size. I hope you know what you need. USDA eggs are specified as the minimum weight of a dozen. EU eggs are specified as the weight ranges per 100, plus a per-egg minimum.

 EU weight standard
 
 SIZE             PER-EGG        PER-100-MIN
 XL-very large    73 g and more   7.3 kg
 L-large          63 to 73        6.4
 M-medium         53 to 63        5.4
 S-small          under 53 g      4.5
 
 USDA weight standard
 
 CLASS         MIN NET / DOZEN   CONVERTED TO MIN GRAM/EGG
 Jumbo         30 ounces         70.75
 Extra Large   27 ounces         63.675
 Large         24 ounces         56.6
 Medium        21 ounces         49.525
 Small         18 ounces         42.45
 Peewee        15 ounces         35.375

I hope you aren't using a Japanese standard, because I don't know what that would be. Same as USDA, because of World War II maybe?

Assuming you mean &quot;USDA Extra Large&quot;, this is 255 to 283 grams of egg. (probably 255, if the producers are being cheap) This is about 4.5 regular (USDA Large) eggs. It is probably about 5 EU size M eggs. (4.71 if both parts of the world are being cheap, and closer to 4 if the EU producers are generous)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The story of Israel is like no other. The country of Israel you see on the map today is named after the ancient kingdom of Israel in the [[Biblical Studies|Hebrew Bible]] (the Old Testament). People of the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] believe that the kingdom was granted to the Jews by God. But the modern state of Israel is not a direct continuation of this ancient kingdom. It has its origins in the political '''Zionist movement''' of the 19th century.

==The Old Yishuv under the Ottoman Empire==
[[File:MarktJaffaGustavBauernfeind1887.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Painting of Jaffa (south of modern [[w:Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv]]) in 1887]]
Since ancient times, Jews had been moved from Israel, by necessity or by force, to various places around Europe and other parts of the world. By 1516, only a small community of 5,000 remained in Galilee. At that point, the first pre-modern ''[[w:Pre-Zionist Aliyah|aliyah]]'' (return) began, with [[w:Sephardic|Sephardic]] (Spanish-speaking) victims of the Inquisition arriving in Israel with the approval of the [[w:Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these Jews formed a community called the [[w:Old Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] (settlement), centered in [[w:Safed|Safed]] in Galilee. They were joined in the 19th century by Jewish religious movements from other parts of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; notably among which, were the disciples of the Goan of Vilna, whom settled in Jerusalem beginning in 1808, by 1810 they numbered 511 families.

The Jews called their homeland ''[[w:Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]]'', meaning the Land of Israel, as opposed to the nation of Israel consisting of all Jews. The Ottoman Empire did not administer ''Eretz Israel'' under any particular designation. The region was officially under the control of the provinces of Syria and Palestine/Lebanon, but the Ottoman government was weak (it was the [[w:Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Decline of the Ottoman Empire]]) and day-to-day affairs were dictated by local leaders. Eventually, Jerusalem and Jaffa were given their own division.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who else lived in Palestine?==
There were many kinds of people in Palestine. The majority were Arabs, but there were also Greeks, Armenians and many others (Christian and Muslim), as well as the Old Yishuv.

{{quote|The population of Jerusalem is composed of Muslims, Jews, Greeks, Latins, Armenians, Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics and a handful of Protestants. One hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now in this birthplace of Christianity. The nice shades of nationality comprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, are altogether too numerous to mention. It seems to me that all the races and colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among the 14,000 souls that dwell in Jerusalem.|Mark Twain, ''The Innocents Abroad''. 1867.}}
Under Ottoman rule, only Muslims were allowed to hold land. The Ottomans also attempted to retard Jewish immigration with various local laws. In practice, though, a well-educated Jew could deal with Turkish officials to legally immigrate, and then establish a semi-legal hold on land by farming it. The true problems began for the nascent Zionist movement when they encountered the overwhelming Arab majority as well as the existing Old Yishuv community.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, pp. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Birth of Zionism==
Although the earliest Christians tolerated Jewish communities, [[w:antisemitism|antisemitism]] arose during several periods in the Middle Ages. Jews lived separately from Christians and adhered to ''kashrut'' (kosher) laws and other customs that seemed mysterious and alien. Most jobs were forbidden to Jews as an &quot;out-group&quot;, so they took up money-lending and intellectual studies, leading to a popular conception that they profited from the work of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Roth. ''Medieval Jewish Civilization''. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 10th century, most of Europe was under the rule of Christian monarchs. As the Jews managed the debts of the monarchs, expelling the Jews was an efficient way to balance a failing kingdom's budget. In Germany [[w:Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade|the persecution of Jews was renewed]] in 1096 during the Crusades. Jews were [[w:Edict of Expulsion|expelled from England]] in 1291, from France in 1391, from Austria in 1421, and [[w:Alhambra Decree|from Spain]] in 1492. Anti-Jewish laws such as the [[w:yellow badge|yellow badge]] were commonplace in most European countries, and mob violence was common. Martin Luther, the leader of the Protestant Reformation, also wrote a book entitled ''[[w:On the Jews and Their Lies|On the Jews and Their Lies]]'', which fueled more antisemitism. The strongest retaliations occurred in the seventh century as mass expulsions and forced conversions occurred in many European countries. 

Among Jewish communities the solution to this violence was not entirely clear. It was believed that in a future messianic age, their ancient kingdom would be restored;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.R., 1971, 'Vision and intent in Zionist Thought', p. 10,11&lt;/ref&gt; hence prayers on [[w:Yom Kippur|Yom Kippur]] and [[w:Passover|Passover]] would conclude (and still do) with &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot;.

During the Age of Enlightenment, many European countries granted Jews equal rights. An intellectual class developed among both Jews and Gentiles which considered the abandonment of old traditions and the assimilation into the European lifestyle the key to the success of the Jewish people. One Russian socialist wrote the following about his view of ethnicity:
{{quote|You well know that I hate Judaism exactly as I hate all other nation &quot;hoods&quot; and national &quot;isms&quot; [...] but I am not ashamed of my Jewish descent, and, among the other oppressed, I love that part of humanity whom the ruling national and religious principles single out as Jews. And again, indeed, I do not love them all, but only the suffering masses and those capable of joining us. Otherwise I should not deserve the name of socialist.|Aaron Samuel Lieberman, quoted in Halpern 2000, p. 143}}
However, antisemitism did not fade but merely [[w:Racial antisemitism|changed its target]], segregating the Jews as an &quot;un-European&quot; ethnic group. Ashkenazi Jews experienced hundreds of bloody mob attacks throughout Eastern Europe during the [[w:Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]]. When European intellectuals saw that merely changing their lifestyles was insufficient, allegiance to the Jewish people began to seem like an acceptable option. (American Jews did not experience systematic and government-enforced antisemitism, and thus tended to downplay ethnic alliances.)&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; An exemplary Russian Jew who changed his mind about settlement in Israel was [[w:Moshe Leib Lilienblum|Moshe Leib Lilienblum]], who first aimed towards economic independence in America, then decided that only in Israel could Jews live without alienation from society.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikipedia|Timeline of Zionism}}In a proto-Zionist essay hinting towards a desire to resettle in Palestine, Moses Hess bemoaned the secularism of intellectuals, and reminded them of the sacred place of pious Jews:
{{quote|It seems that on account of the hatred which surrounds him on all sides, the German Jew is determined to estrange himself from Judaism as far as possible, and endeavors even to deny his race. No reform of the Jewish religion, however extreme, is radical enough for the educated German Jew. [...]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My grandfather once showed me some olives and dates, and remarked, with beaming eyes, &quot;These were raised in Eretz Israel.&quot; Everything that reminds the pious Jew of Palestine is as dear to him as the sacred relics of his ancestral house.|Moses Hess, &quot;[[w:Rome and Jerusalem|Rome and Jerusalem]]&quot;. 1862.}}
The political motivation for Zionism began to form in the 1860s and 1870s. The first &quot;Zion Society&quot; formed in Germany in 1861. In 1870, the ''Alliance Israélite Universelle'' founded an agricultural school called [[w:Mikveh Israel|Mikveh Israel]] near the city of Jaffa. The land for this school was granted by the Ottoman Sultan.
===The first Zionists immigrate===
{{wikisource|Auto-Emancipation}}
{{quote|If we already knew where to direct our steps, were we compelled to emigrate again, we could surely make a vast step forward. We must set vigorously to work to complete the great task of ''self-liberation''. We must use all the resources which human intellect and human experience have devised, instead of leaving our national regeneration to blind chance. The territory to be acquired must be fertile, well-situated and sufficiently extensive to allow the settlement of several millions. The land, as national property, must be inalienable. |Leon Pinsker, &quot;[[wikisource:Auto-Emancipation|Auto-Emancipation]]&quot;. 1882.}}
In the same year that Pinsker's essay was published, the [[w:First Aliyah|first Zionist Aliyah]] occurred. Roughly 30,000 Jews left Eastern Europe to become farmers in the Ottoman Empire. While previous ''aliyah'' had been religious in nature, this one was purely political-- an escape from antisemitism, with the goal of creating a sustainable Jewish community in ''Eretz Israel''. However, half of the settlers eventually left the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/First_Aliyah.html Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them came on a 30-day pilgrimage visa, and stayed past its expiration date.

==Theodor Herzl and the World Zionist Congress==
Zionism had already developed by the time of the First Aliyah, but those who promoted it were working at cross purposes. The Orthodox Jews behind Religious Zionism were willing to cooperate with secularized Jews to the extent of sending people to Israel, but wanted simultaneously to teach them about their duties to God, and agitated for those living in ''Eretz Israel'' to live under the rule of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Religious Zionists and the Old Yishuv were unhappy at the prospect of secular Jews tilling the land during a sabbath year; an attempt to appease them by subletting the land to non-Jews while the work was being done fell through.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 106-9&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a growing coalition of [[w:Labor Zionism|Labor Zionists]] who wanted ''Eretz Israel'' to be a breeding ground for intentionally organized collectives, a land which would be controlled by its own working class.

Theodor Herzl entered into the Zionist movement fully aware of these competing interests, and considered their balance &quot;an egg dance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl was a journalist from Vienna assigned to the [[w:Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfus Affair]]. Alfred Dreyfus was a Jewish officer in French Army accused of passing military documents to the German Embassy. Despite the lack of any conclusive evidence, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment. From the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl concluded that antisemitism was difficult to escape no matter how &quot;enlightened&quot; a country one lived in.

He interviewed with Baron Maurice De Hirsch, one of the wealthiest men of his time. De Hirsch had founded the Jewish Colonization Association with the aim of settling Jews from Russia and Romania to Argentina and other parts of the Americas. Herzl came with 22 pages of notes arguing for a political organization to rally Jews under their own flag  rather than leave it to philanthropists like the Baron. De Hirsch was uninterested in this suggestion. This led to Herzl publishing a pamphlet called ''The Jewish State''.

{{wikisource|The Jewish State}}

{{quote|Let all who are willing to join us, fall in behind our banner and fight for our cause with voice and pen and deed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those Jews who agree with our idea of a State will attach themselves to the Society, which will thereby be authorized to confer and treat with Governments in the name of our people. The Society will thus be acknowledged in its relations with Governments as a State-creating power. This acknowledgment will practically create the State.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Should the Powers declare themselves willing to admit our sovereignty over a neutral piece of land, then the Society will enter into negotiations for the possession of this land. Here two territories come under consideration, Palestine and Argentine. In both countries important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end badly. It continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the Government to stop a further influx of Jews. Immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Society of Jews will treat with the present masters of the land, putting itself under the protectorate of the European Powers, if they prove friendly to the plan. We could offer the present possessors of the land enormous advantages, assume part of the public debt, build new roads for traffic, which our presence in the country would render necessary, and do many other things. The creation of our State would be beneficial to adjacent countries, because the cultivation of a strip of land increases the value of its surrounding districts in innumerable ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[...] If His Majesty the Sultan were to give us Palestine, we could in return undertake to regulate the whole finances of Turkey. We should there form a portion of a rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism. We should as a neutral State remain in contact with all Europe, which would have to guarantee our existence.|Theodor Herzl, &quot;[[wikisource:The Jewish State/The Jewish Question|The Jewish State]]&quot;. 1896.}}

===Formation of the Congress===
Zionists responded eagerly to Herzl's suggestion to meet and unify their diverse organizations. The First Zionist Congress was convened in Switzerland in August 1897. There were 200 delegates representing every aspect of Jewish religion, cultural philosophy, and thought. The 3-day congress founded the World Zionist Organization with Herzl as president.

During the First Zionist Congress, the following agreement, commonly known as the Basel Program, was reached:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law. The Congress contemplates the following means to the attainment of this end:
#The promotion by appropriate means of the settlement in ''Eretz Israel'' of Jewish farmers, artisans, and manufacturers.
#The organization and uniting of the whole of Jewry by means of appropriate institutions, both local and international, in accordance with the laws of each country.
#The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national sentiment and national consciousness.
#Preparatory steps toward obtaining the consent of governments, where necessary, in order to reach the goals of Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/basleprogram.htm The Basle Program. Resolutions of the First Zionist Congress] August 30, 1897 (mideastweb)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mauschel (Seff), Die Welt, 15. Oct 1897.png|thumb|right|200px|''Die Welt'', the newspaper of the World Zionist Congress. It was printed in German.]]

Herzl met with the Ottoman Sultan and asked for a charter that would allow Jewish mass immigration to Palestine. This request was denied. Knowing the overwhelming support for a Jewish state in ''Eretz Israel'', he then met with Great Britain and discussed making Jewish settlement in Sinai Peninsula, part of their client state of Egypt. This too failed, but the British suggested making room in &quot;Uganda&quot; (actually Kenya) instead. Herzl brought this idea to the Zionist Congress in 1903. The debate over the Uganda option was so heated that the Congress nearly schismed into two rival factions.
===Responses to Zionism===
By 1904, cultural Zionism was accepted by most Zionists and a schism was beginning to develop between the Zionist movement and Orthodox Judaism. In 1912, [[w:World Agudath Israel|World Agudath Israel]] was founded by Orthodox Jews in response to the popularity of Zionism, socialism, and communism. It aimed to promote the traditional forms of the Jewish religion, although there was and is much diversity within Orthodox Judaism.

==Second Aliyah==
Between 1904, when pogroms in Eastern Europe intensified, and 1914, when World War I began, there was a [[w:Second Aliyah|Second Aliyah]]. Once again, half of the pioneers left ''Eretz Israel'' eventually, but the Second Aliyah had more successes than the first. The settlement of [[w:Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv]] was founded by political Zionists on a sand dune north of Jaffa, and its founding families built roads and a water system for themselves. Today, Tel Aviv is the second largest city in Israel. The Second Aliyah Zionists also founded a self-defense group called the [[w:Hashomer|Hashomer]], built a high school, and they cast off the [[w:Yiddish|Yiddish]] of their European ancestors to begin a [[w:revival of the Hebrew language|revival of the Hebrew language]]. Use of Hebrew had been attempted during the First Aliyah, but the language only took root during the Second.  Pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary were standardized, textbooks were written, and by 1913 when a German Zionist group attempted to start a technical university taught in German, the entire Yishuv rebelled against them.

The Labor Zionists who arrived during the Second Aliyah discovered that the settlers of the First Aliyah had become landlords, paying Arabs to tend their land for them.
{{quote|We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was not the way we hoped to settle the country—this old way with Jews on top and Arabs working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed at all. There must be a better way.|Yossef Baratz, founder of the first kibbutz&lt;ref&gt;Baratz, Joseph. ''A Village by the Jordan: The Story of Degania''. Tel Aviv: Ichud Habonim, 1956, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;}}Baratz and his fellow ''olim'' (Jews arriving in Israel) knew that they could not maintain independent farms. The poor land conditions and weak government meant that settlers had to rely on each other. Instead, Baratz and eleven of his companions established a communal farm called [[w:Degania Alef|Degania]] at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. Their community would grow into the first [[w:kibbutz|kibbutz]].

The founders of Degania worked backbreaking labor attempting to rebuild what they saw as their ancestral land and to spread the social revolution. One pioneer later said &quot;the body is crushed, the legs fail, the head hurts, the sun burns and weakens.&quot; At times half of the kibbutz members could not report for work. Many young men and women left the kibbutz for easier lives in Jewish cities on the East Bank of the Jordan or returned to the Diaspora. But despite the difficulties, by 1914, Degania had fifty members. Other kibbutzim were founded around the Sea of Galilee and the nearby Jezreel Valley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==World War I==
In December 1914, as the machinations of World War I made it apparent that Britain would enter into battle with the Ottoman Empire, [[w:Ze'ev Jabotinsky|Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] proposed that a Jewish regiment be formed in Palestine to assist the British. This battalion, called the [[w:Jewish Legion|Jewish Legion]], was formed in 1917. A Jewish espionage network called [[w:Nili|Nili]] also assisted the British.

[[File:Capture of Jerusalem 1917.jpg|thumb|right|British cannons capture Jerusalem from the Ottomans.]]
In November 1917, as General Allenby was preparing to conquer Palestine, the British Foreign office issued the [[w:Balfour Declaration|Balfour Declaration]], a letter from the Foreign Secretary, Lord Balfour, to Lord Rothschild, head of the British Zionist movement. The declaration stated:
{{quote|His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.}}Thus, when Palestine was captured in December some part of it was designated as an area of Jewish settlement. It was not as much as the Zionists would have liked, but it was the first official recognition of the Zionist movement.

==[[w:British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]==
After the war ended, the Allied powers began to partition up the Ottoman Empire, as had been their plan for several years. With the Balfour Declaration in mind, the region they dubbed Palestine was set aside as a Jewish &quot;National Home&quot;. However, the intention of the Allies was not to expel those already living in Palestine, but only to state as policy that other groups should make room for the Jews. The final mandate read, in part, as follows:
{{quote|Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on November 2nd, 1917, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country [...]}}
The Mandate was implemented in 1922. During next 25 years, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally to Palestine, and many more Jews came illegally.
==Zionism flourishes under the Mandate==
[[File:KKL tin.jpg|thumb|right|In America, Jewish organizations forwarded money to the [[w:Jewish National Fund|Jewish National Fund]], a branch of the World Zionist Organization, to plant trees in Israel.]]
Successes of Zionism so far: &quot;Jewish homeland&quot; semi-guaranteed. Hebrew language. [[w:Haganah|Haganah]]: Jewish paramilitary force. But what about the Arabs? More than two-thirds of the population of Palestine was non-Jewish; could it really become a Jewish state?
{{quote|The Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. [...] After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000. Every traveller in Palestine who visits them is impressed by the contrast between these pleasant villages, with the beautiful stretches of prosperous cultivation about them, and the primitive conditions of life and work by which they are surrounded.|''[http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/herbert.html An Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine to the League of Nations]'', June 1921}}

===The kibbutz movement expands===
During the Mandate, the ''kibbutzim'' of the Second Aliyah became a model for intentional communities throughout Palestine, called the [[w:Settlement movement (Israel)|settlement movement]].
* moshavim shitufiim
* moshavim
* [[w:Communal settlement (Israel)|Communal settlement]]

The ''kibbutzim'' and other intentional communities were considered the pride and joy of Zionism throughout the Mandate years. After Israel became a nation, collectivist kibbutz politics became independent of Zionism in general; fierce debates were held over the desirability of consumerism or affiliation with Germany or Communist Russia. Kibbutzim and other intentionally organized settlements still exist today, encompassing a diverse range of political ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competing school systems===
The British government had no interest in regulating schools, so under the Mandate four different Jewish schooling systems developed from the four major factions of ''olim''. All of these schools accused each other of stealing students and immigrants away, and while all four expressed a desire that the schools one day be unified, they all insisted that their own system must be used in the future unification.

Mandate formalized by league of Nations  September 23, 1922. Jewish reaction was mixed. one group protested the creation of Transjordan-both Western Palestinian Arabs and Jews could not buy land or           settle in Transjordan because the British prohibited it even             though Abdullah was willing        -the incensed Jews formed Revisionist for a unified state. The leader of Revisionists was Vladimir Jabotinsky - a Russian Jew. However, a majority of Jews were satisfied with the mandate

[[w:Sir Herbert Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] was a British Jew who served as first High Commissioner       of Palestine     . Under Samuel's rule the British recognized Vaad Leumi (National Council), Elected Assembly, and          local council representives of Jewish community. He established Hebrew as official language and placed restrictions on Jewish immigration in response to            Arab complaints. (Arabs had no restrictions on their immigration by British.)

People questioned if Israel could support the influx of Jews with the existing Arab population. Arab peasants or laborers called Fellaheen were already being displaced. Zionists claimed that adopting European farming techniques would allow Fellaheen to live on smaller tracts of land.

==Aliyah Bet==
''Aliyah'' to Palestine resumed as soon as World War I was over. During the [[w:Third Aliyah|Third Aliyah]] 35,000 Jews came to the country. They were not motivated by the Zionist World Congress, who in fact opposed the mass migration, but by their own volition after the Balfour Declaration and pogroms in the Russian Civil War.

World War I left much of Western Europe devastated, and antisemitism rose dramatically. From 1924-1928 there was the [[w:Fourth Aliyah|Fourth Aliyah]]: 82,000 Jews, 23,000 left. With the Nazis came the [[w:Fifth Aliyah|Fifth Aliyah]]: 250,000 Jews, and only 20,000 left!  There was also the [[w:Haavara Agreement|Haavara Agreement]] between the Jewish Agency and the Nazis, to bring German Jews to Palestine. As a result of Nazi cooperation, 60,000 Jews came to Palestine.

[[w:Youth Aliyah|Children fleeing the Nazis on their own]] were sent to [[w:Youth village|youth village]]s to be collectively cared for and raised. And not only this, but there was [[w:Aliyah Bet|Aliyah Bet]]: illegal immigration sponsored by covert Zionist groups. 

{{quote|We felt proud and exultant to arrive with the Jewish flag at our mast. The refugees looked for the first time upon the Holy Land with wondering and often tear-filled eyes. This was the sight for which they had longed with all their hearts, the sight for which they had risked their lives crossing one illegal border after another and on the high seas.|I.F. Stone. ''Underground to Palestine''. 1947.}}

==Arab discontent and revolt==
During the Mandate the Jewish population in Palestine rose sharply: a growth rate of 8.6% per year, compared with 2.7% for Christians, Muslims, Druze, and others. The Arab population of Palestine was flummoxed by the number of immigrants, which with the &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; was even greater than Britain's most extreme predictions. Groups like the [[w:Independence Party (Palestine)|Independence Party]] and the [[w:Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]] demanded Arab rule. Starting in 1936, an [[w:1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] demanded an end to Jewish immigration and independence for Palestine. The British government imprisoned many of these Arabs without trial and demolished some of their houses. By the time the strike concluded in March 1939, more than 5,000 Arabs; 400 Jews; and 200 Britons had been killed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intensifying violence: Arabs v. Jews, Jews v. Arabs==
British did not allow Jews to form a fighting unit till Sept. 1940 with 200 men. Sept. 20, 1944 Jewish Brigade formed. to restrict enlistment number of Jews was supposed to equal number of Arabs. Arabs did enlist, mainly inactive during war. end of 1941 more than 10,000 Palestinian Jews joined army. also in 1941 Palmach - peluggot mahaz - &quot;Shock Companies&quot; - created by Haganah Elite Strike Force designed to defen Yishuv in an emergency

Jews increasingly aware that British would not implement Balfour Declaration, i.e., giving Jews a state. May 1942  Zionists meeting at Biltmore Hotel in NY urged Britain to allow Jewish Agency power to form a Jewish State. state not a separate country until a Jewish majority. Agency responsible for country's agriculture and industry

===Jews v. British===
Feb. 1, 1944 Menachim Begin, leader of Irgun declared a Jewish revolt against British. Irgun attacked military targets. Late Feb. 1944 Irgun attacked the offices of Immigration Department  in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. protested closed gates of Palestine

Nov. 1943 20 members of Lehi a.k.a. Stern Gang escaped from Latrun  prison. Nathan Friedmans-Yellin among them, and resurrected Lehi and became  its leader. Lehi believed British wouldn't leave because of oil refinery in  Haifa. They threatened British army installments, camps, interrupted transportation with mines, intimidated soldiers with death threats, patrolled streets till they found a group of British police or soldiers and opened fire on them.

British response:           a. curfews on Jewish cities          b. mass arrests          c. instituting death penalty for carrying firearms          d. underground Jewish forces intensified attacks

Chaim Weizmann sent letter of condolences to a wounded British              soldier. Jewish leadership appalled by killings; afraid violence would jeopardize the creation of a Jewish State. The Jewish Agency feared for their own positions. April 2, 1944 Agency officially declared a policy of opposition             -prevent activities             -increase negative propaganda against &quot;terrorists&quot;

===Yom Kippur 1944===
Begin announced that shofar will be blown at the Western Wall. this had been prohibited since 1929 riots. Sept. 27 shofar sounded and at the same time Irgun attacked 4              different British fortresses. Psychological victory. British did not retaliate.

===Assassination===
Radical elements among the Zionists aimed to assassinate key British leaders as punishment for complicity in Holocaust. 4 attempts on Sir Harold MacMichael all failed. British minister of Cairo, Lord Moyne, former Colonial Secretary.. Nov. 6, 1944 Eliahu Hakim and Eliau Bet-Zouri assassinated Moyne. assassinators both tried and hanged.
==Israel after the Holocaust==
[[File:19450715 Buchenwald survivors arrive in Haifa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Survivors of the Nazi concentration camp [[w:Buchenwald|Buchenwald]] immigrated illegally to Israel.]]
Jewish survivors of [[the Holocaust]] were not taken to Israel but [[w:Sh'erit ha-Pletah|rehabilitated in camps in Europe]]. However, many of these survivors were strongly motivated to leave Europe. Without a legal means of emigration, they turned to &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; in even greater numbers than before, a movement called [[w:Berihah|Berihah]]. Britain opened [[w:Cyprus internment camps|internment camps in Cyprus]] to house Holocaust survivors they had captured; some were held until 1949. In the [[w:SS Exodus|SS ''Exodus'']] incident, the British Royal Navy seized one of the Berihah ships and sent it back to Germany, causing a media scandal.
{{quote|Thousands of people, young and old, had been torn from their loved ones during the Nazi occupation and never knew what had become of them -- in the ghettos, the deportations, the death camps, the forests.

Leah Koren of Lublin, now in Israel, is looking for her sister Sheina Friedman, nee Koren.&quot; All were recent immigrants on the threshold of a new life.|Tom Segev, ''1949: The First Israelis''. 1998. pp.ix-x}}
===Holocaust survivors (DPs) and Zionist militancy===
The continuing flow of refugees enraged Arab leaders and, in the eyes of the British, threatened the stability of the region. The British thus refused to accept 100,000 refugees in 1946. In response, militant elements among Hagana, the Irgun, and Lehi kidnapped British officers and [[w:King David Hotel bombing|bombed the King David Hotel]], killing 91 British, Jewish, and Arab employees. The response from leaders in Britain was actually helpful from the Zionists: Churchill announced that he did not see much of a British interest in Palestine, and the general British public began to weigh the costs of a continued occupation.

In October 1946, U.S. President Truman announced his support for the Jewish Agency's partition plan. For the Zionists, a long-awaited victory seemed to be on the way; however, the road from partition to statehood would be a rocky one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==UN Partition==
In 1945 the US Congress adopted a resolution for the restoration of a Jewish Commonwealth. According to a public opinion poll [source?] 65% supported the creation of a Jewish State, and during the third quarter of 1947 White House received 62,850 postcards, 1,100 letters, and 1,400 telegrams urging it to push the UN to adopt the partition plan. Truman reacted negatively to what it perceived as a &quot;Jewish Lobby&quot;. Members of Truman's Administration opposed partition [source?] and undermined U.S. support [source?]. James Forrestal [who?] believed that Zionist aims would bring about a threat to U.S. oil supplies [source?]. Joint Chiefs of Staff thought that Arabs might align with Soviets if they were alienated by the West.

Cuba and Greece voted against although U.S. dependents. U.S. and Soviet Union for the partition. SU wanted British out of Palestine. Asian countries solidly against. Garcia-Grandados of Guatemala and Fabrega of Uruguay were outspoken in their support. The Vatican was subtly against partition. Most of Latin America supported Cuba, El Salvado and Colombia against. Britain was opposed because it was not acceptable to both Jews and Arabs.

The UN was empowered only to make a recommendation, and Britain was under no obligation to carry out the UN plan, although UN member-nations expected Britaln to implement the decision. On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly voted to recommend Partition by a vote of 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions.

6,120 square miles of the 10,400 Palestine was allotted to the new Jewish State. More than half of the Jewish State, some 3,670 square miles, consisted of the Negev Desert. The state itself consisted of three regions, a Northern section, a Coastal section, and Negev, which were connected by narrow corridors of land. International Jerusalem was connected to Jewish State by a narrow road running through the heart of the Arab State.  ~500,000 Jews in Jewish State and ~350, 000 Arabs. ~92,000 Arabs lived in Tiberias, Safed, Haifa, and Bet Shean. 40,000 were Bedouins mostly in Negev. remainder spread throughout and occupied most of the agricultural land.

===Partition Problems===
UN appointed a commission with representatives from Denmark,  Czechoslovakia, Panama, Bolivia, and the Philippines to implement their resolution. British gave notice of their evacuation to be August 1, 1948. it actually happened May 15, 1948. Because Britain was critical of the resolution, it declined to implement it, instead withdrawing from the territory. The UN commission into Palestine was not allowed into the country until 2 weeks prior to the British evacuation, rendering it ineffective.

Open hostilities between Arabs and Jews began with greater intensity. Arabs declared a protest strike and instigated riots- 62 Jews killed, 32 Arabs. end of second week 93 Arabs, 84 Jews, and 7 Englishmen killed and   scores more injured. jurists of Al-Azhar University in Cairo called on Muslim world to            proclaim Jihad against Jews. Minority of Jews not satisfied with having a Jewish State in Palestine; among them were members of Irgun and Lehi

between Nov. 30, 1947 and Feb. 1, 1948 427 Arabs, 381 Jews, and 46     British were killed. Jan. 9, 1948 1,000 Arabs attacked Jewish communities in Northern      Palestine. by Feb. British said so many Arabs infiltrated that they lacked             the forces to run them back. British surrendered bases and arms to Arabs irregulars and Arab             Legion, which was being run by a British commander at the time. this facilitated Arab raids and eventual invasion. British refused to allow the Jews to form a militia to defend            themselves till the termination of the Mandate. Jews couldn't legally form or train an army or import weapons. existing Arab States free to import weapons. British even signed a treaty with Transjordan that provided Arabs             with arms while a blockade was maintained against the Jews   

The King of Jordan expressed his position on what was called the &quot;Jewish Problem&quot; as follows:
{{quote|Our position is so simple and natural that we are amazed it should even be questioned. It is exactly the same position you in America take in regard to the unhappy [case of the] European Jews. You are sorry for them, but you do not want them in your country.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We do not want them in ours, either. Not because they are Jews, but because they are foreigners. We would not want hundreds of thousands of foreigners in our country, be they Englishmen or Norwegians or Brazilians or whatever.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Think for a moment: In the last 25 years we have had one third of our entire population forced upon us. In America that would be the equivalent of 45,000,000 complete strangers admitted to your country, over your violent protest, since 1921. How would you have reacted to that?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because of our perfectly natural dislike of being overwhelmed in our own homeland, we are called blind nationalists and heartless anti-Semites. This charge would be ludicrous were it not so dangerous.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No people on earth have been less &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; than the Arabs. The persecution of the Jews has been confined almost entirely to the Christian nations of the West. Jews, themselves, will admit that never since the Great Dispersion did Jews develop so freely and reach such importance as in Spain when it was an Arab possession. With very minor exceptions, Jews have lived for many centuries in the Middle East, in complete peace and friendliness with their Arab neighbours.|King Abdullah of Jordan. [http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/kabd_eng.html &quot;As the Arabs see the Jews&quot;]. November 1947.}}

==Forces in Palestine==
On Feb. 17, 1948 the Palestine Commission told UN Secretary Council that the     partition plan needed military aid to be carried out. Russians insisted on sending a contingent to Palestine if U.S. did, and Truman did not want Russians in Palestine under any circumstances, fearing that Israel would double its problems by becoming a front in the Cold War. Other countries in UN did not want to send military forces without the aid of one of the two superpower. Hence, the only outside forces in Palestine by the time of independence were the lackadaisical British.

{{quote|It is now clear, without the slightest doubt, that were we to face the Palestinians alone, everything would be all right.  They, the decisive majority of them, do not want to fight us, and all of them together are unable to stand up to us, and all of them together are unable to stand up to us.|David Ben-Gurion. ''Political and Diplomatic Documents of CZA and ISA, December 1947-May 1948'', p. 128.}}

{{quote|In the event of a conflict, not only can the Jews defend themselves, but they will defeat the Palestinian Arabs.|Winston Churchill, quoted in ''History of the Haganah'' p. 820}}

The combined troops of seven Arab nations would sound like a formidable force, but initially there were only 20,000 to 23,500-- outnumbered by 25,000 to 30,000 standing Israeli forces, plus the Jewish paramilitary groups of [[w:Lehi (group)|Lehi]], [[w:Irgun|Irgun]], and [[w:Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]], and the [[w:Jewish Settlement Police|Jewish Settlement Police]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Kurzman, &quot;Genesis 1948&quot;, 1970, p.282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simha Flapan. ''The Birth of Israel: Myths And Realities''. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, the Arabs sent more of their armies to Palestine, but Israeli forces were supported by Jewish ''olim'' recruits from across Europe, who started arriving in enormous numbers within 48 hours of independence.

After May 15 most of the underground Jewish resistance was absorbed into the [[w:Haganah|Haganah]], which had been redubbed the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). On May 28 Lehi formally disbanded when 850 of its fighters joined the IDF.

The U.S. on Dec. 5, 1947 imposed an arms embargo on Palestine; neither Jews nor Arabs could buy weapons, and British only sold weapons to Arabs.

The fighting ended on July 15. 6,500 Israelis had died, and most of Israel's irrigated agricultural land had become useless waste. Meanwhile, [[w:List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War|hundreds of Arab towns had been ethnically cleansed]] by IDF forces. Particularly memorable to Palestinians today is the village of [[w:Deir Yassin|Deir Yassin]], where the entire population was massacred by paramilitary groups.

==Ceasefire==
After Israel had won its independence, its diplomats approached the leaders of each of the Arab nations to work out a formal armistice agreement. Rather than drawing up permanent lines, the parties decided to create &quot;temporary&quot; borders based on where the armies were standing at the end of the war. The borders established by these agreements are called the [[w:Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].

Rather than translating into a peace treaty, the ceasefire was extremely shallow and left the question of Israel's future security and ambitions unresolved, a problem that was unsettling to both sides. This was a purposeful decision on the part of David Ben-Gurion, who was an [[w:Offensive realism|offensive realist]] who believed that Israel's military might made any possible compromise a needless concession to the weaker states surrounding it, and that in due time Israel's neighbors would be forced to recognize it and rely on it for trade and security. Ben-Gurion's main adversary was [[w:Eliyahu Sasson|Eliyahu Sasson]], who believed that face-saving concessions such as allowing Arabs to remain in their villages and giving the Negev to Egypt were necessary for Israel to gain acceptance in the Arab community. Sasson wrote that &quot;the Egyptians keep reiterating that they regarded the armistice agreement as only the first step to the future. It is essential that both you ([[w:Moshe Sharett|Moshe Sharett]]) and Ben-Gurion devote all your strength towards peace, as you did toward defense.&quot; This position was thought to be naive and not serious enough.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.28-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The armistice lines were unsatisfying for both parties. Most Zionists felt like the Green Line was waiving part of the Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were deported from their villages and ''kibbutzim'' on the Jordanian and Egyptian sides, and Arabs were deported from villages on the Israeli side (see Refugees below). On both sides, villages were subsequently demolished to assuage the fears on both sides that people would attempt to reclaim their homes by force. Heavily populated regions and villages were split in two by the line, which was drawn on a relatively small map that lacked ownership data. For example, the town of [[w:Barta'a|Barta'a]] became 1/3 Israeli and 2/3 Jordanian; today, the town has a wall running through it that is open for only a few minutes every day.

==Refugees==

{{quote|Yigal Allon asked Ben-Gurion what was to be done with the civilian population. Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture of &quot;drive them out.&quot; &quot;Driving out&quot; is a term with a harsh ring. Psychologically, this was one of the most difficult actions we undertook. The population of Lydda did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the ten or fifteen miles to the point where they met up with the Arab Legion.|''Service Diary'', quoted in David Shipler, in the ''New York Times'' of 10/22/1979}}
{{quote|May 13, 1948, is a day that will remain forever engraved in my memory. That day, less than twenty four hours before the proclamation of the Israeli state, my family fled Jaffa for refuge in Gaza. We had been under siege: the Zionist forces controlled all the roads leading south, and the only escape left open to us was the sea. It was under a hail of shells fired from Jewish artillery set up in neighboring settlements, especially Tel Aviv, that I clambered onto a makeshift boat with my parents, my four brothers and sisters, and other relatives. [...]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The boat had scarcely lifted anchor when a woman started shrieking. One of her four children wasn't on board and she implored us to put back to port to look for him. Caught under the heavy fire of the Jewish guns, we couldn't turn back without risking the lives of the several hundred people, many of them children, crushed together in the small craft.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The piercing cries of the poor woman went unanswered. She broke down into sobs. Some of us tried to calm her by saying that her son would surely be picked up and later brought to Gaza. But in vain. Her nerves finally cracked and she straddles the rail, throwing herself into the sea. In an apparent effort to save her, her husband jumped in after her. It soon became apparent that neither knew how to swim. The angry waves finally swallowed them up under our very eyes. We all remained rooted to the boat, paralyzed with horror.|Abu Iyad. ''My Home, My Land''. 1948.}}
{{quote|One of my schoolfriends was a Jewish girl named Dvora; she was very sweet, and I loved her. One day, she invited me home, and I went along. When we neared her house I suddenly realized where she was taking me: her family now occupied my aunt's house! My shock was redoubled when I went inside and found my aunt's pictures still hanging on the walls; it was on my aunt's piano that Dvora practiced. I even found a doll I used to play with!|Raymonda Tawil ''My Home, My Prison.'' As quoted in ''Seder of the Children of Abraham''}}

Roughly 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled Israel during the war of independence, for reasons that are still nder dispute. They arrived in the West Bank and Gaza strip without homes, possessions, or jobs. During the same timespan, nearly 600,000 Jews arrived in Israel from various Arab states, which they had also left for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Christian city of [[w:Kafr Bir'im|Kafr Bir'im]] was one of many completely razed during the war. The records for this city are unusually clear: they show that the IDF told the entire village to move to [[w:Jish|Jish]], which had itself been depopulated of its Arab inhabitants. Those who did not leave were dragged to the Jordan border and told to walk across to Jordan, but once the IDF left they walked to Jish instead. In 1972 the people of Bir'im occupied their city, which had been completely emptied, and once again the IDF forcibly removed them to Jish. In 1977 [[w:Menachem Begin|Menachem Begin]] promised the people of Bir'im the right to return if he was elected. They elected him but he decided not to let them return.

    D. International Aid
       i. UN Gerneral Assembly voted on November 19, 1948 to establish the 
          United Nations Relief for Palestinian Refugees (UNRPR) to dispense 
          aid
       ii. UNRPR replaced by United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on 
           Dec. 8, 1949 with a budget of $50 million
          a. substitute public works for direct relief
          b. promote economic development
          c. direct relief would be almost completely replaced by public works 
             with the remaining assistance provided by Arab governments
       iii. UNRWA little chance for success
          a. Arab refugees and Arab states were not prepared to cooperate on 
             the large-scale development projects
          b. Arab governments and refugees unwilling to contribute to any plan 
             that could be interpreted as fostering resettlement, instead they 
             wanted refugees to be repatriated
       iv. Jewish refugees from Arab countries received no international 
           assistance
       v.  Palestinians received millions of dollars through UNRWA
          a. initially U.S. $25 million, Israel ~ $3 million, Arab pledges ~ 
             $600,000
          b. U.S. still largest contributer and Arab nations donate less than 
             5% of UNRWA budget
    E. Where to go?
       i. Jordan was the only Arab country to welcome the Palestinians and 
          grant them citizenship
       ii. King Abdullah considered Jordanians and Palestinian Arabs one 
           people
       iii. by 1950 Abdullah annexed the West Bank and forbade the use of the 
            term Palestine in official documents
       iv. 1952 UNRWA set up a fund of $200 million to provide homes and jobs  
           for Palestinian refudees but it went untouched

      <text xml:space="preserve">Israel faced many problems in between 1949 and 1967. The ethnic cleansing of Arab towns had (temporarily) set aside the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but impoverished Jewish refugees from angered Arab nations created an entirely new set of ethnic problems, and the deeply divided government was barely functioning.

==Jews in Arab Countries==
More than a thousand Jews were killed in antisemitic rioting during the 1940's in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Yemen which helped trigger the mass exodus of Jews from Arab countries. The [[w:Law of Return|Law of Return]] provided all Jews the legal right to immigrate to Israel and immediately become citizens of Israel if they choose to do so. the only exception are those whom the Minister of Interior considers a threat to the public health, welfare, or security of the state

The Right to Return was not written until 1950, but hours after the declaration of independence, ''olim'' came flooding in. There were 100,000 in the first six months, then over 250,000 in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
June 1941: Mufti of Jerusalem, who had fled Palestine, inspired the pro-Nazi coup of Rashid Ali. this sparked rioting and a pogrom in Baghdad. Jews had lived in Iraq for 2,700 years. armed Iraqi mobs with the complicity of the police and the army . murdered 180 Jews and wounded almost 1,000. additional outbreaks 1946-49. after establishment of Israel in 1948, Zionism became a capital. In 1950, Iraqi Jews were permitted to leave the country within a year, provided that they forfeit their citizenship. 1951 the property of Jews who emigrated from Iraq was frozen and economic restrictions were placed on the remaining Jews.

From 1949-1951 Jews were evacuated from Iraq in Operations Ezra and Nehemiah. another 20,000 were smuggled out through Iran. 1952 Iraq's government barred Jews from emigrating. Jews were publicly hanged after false charges of hurling a bomb at the Baghdad office of the US Information Agency

1944 after Syria gained independence from France, the new government banned Jewish emigration to Palestine. the teaching of Hebrew in Jewish schools was severely restricted. attacks escalated and boycotts were called against Jewish    businesses. 1947 after partition, Arab mobs in Aleppo destroyed the 2,500 year old community. scores of Jews were killed. over 200 homes, shops, and synagogues were destroyed. thousands of Jews illegally fled Syria to go to Israel. Jews only minority group whose passports identified their religion. freedom of movement was severly restricted. Jews who tried to flee faced either the death penalty of    imprisonment at hard labor. Jews could not have government or bank jobs. Jews could not acquire telephones of driver's licenses, and could not purchase property. Jewish bank accounts were frozen. the Jewish cemetary in Damascus was paved over to build an airport road. Jewish schools were closed and handed over to Muslims

{{quote|It's been said that there were cases of rape in Ramlah. I can forgive rape, but I will not forgive other acts which seem to me much worse. When they enter a town and forcibly remove rings from the fingers and jewelry from someone's neck, that's a very grave matter... Many are guilty of it.|[[w:Mordehai Bentov|Mordehai Bentov]], recorded in Minutes of Cabinet Meetings on 4 July 1948.}}
Across the world, from Burma to America, Jews were emigrated to Israel by diplomats and Mossad agents-- usually at expensive prices as part of an economic deal. These early immigration movements did not distinguish between ethnicities such as Sephardic and Arabic, focusing only on the political and economic situations of the Jewish populations of each country, and emphasizing communities in distress. In Morocco, for example, the Jewish Agency found an entire village that had gone blind due to trachoma.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries did not want their Jews to leave at all. In these instances Mossad arranged secret smuggling operations on cargo boats, camels, and caravans. However, Mossad also extracted profits from Zionist agencies for each new ''olim'', and made a habit of filling every boat to capacity and bringing in ''olim'' ahead of schedule. By 1952 it was disbanded and replaced with an official Secret Service.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.95-113&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Those from Europe, including Romania and Hungary, have no pioneering spirit at all. They expect a life of luxury and will live only in the city. [They] do not learn the language. ... Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, and Tripolitanians: Most of them speak Hebrew, having belonged to pioneering, Zionist movements (especially the Iraqis and Iranians). Their ambition is to live on the land, in some cases even in kibbutzim.|Ruth Klieger, report to the Prime Minister's Office}}

Immigration to the new state of Israel rose to four times the maximum estimated capacity. Survivors of pogroms came to Israeli ports only to be offloaded into squalid camps, and ironically deloused with sprays of DDT, akin to Nazi concentration camps. Medical assistance was nonexistent, floors were covered in human waste, food portions were meager-- sometimes only bread, milk, and a few olives-- and inhabitants were kept in the camps for months on end. Once immigrants left the camps, the kibbutzim and other agricultural systems were also overwhelmed with applicants and trainees. When the camps were shut down in 1949, ''olim'' were scattered around Israel to work for their food.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.117-138&lt;/ref&gt;


===Operation Magic Carpet===

But Israel was similarly unprepared for another influx of ''olim'' from Yemen, [[w:Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]; a doctor described 12,000 starving immigrants, many of them naked or half-naked, crowded into a &quot;transit&quot; site that was meant to hold 500 without as much as a tent to protect them from the elements. This reflected not only the slow progress of systematizing ''aliyah'' but also the conditions in Yemen, where child mortality was estimated at 80 percent, most of the population was constantly sick, and surviving children were quickly married to other Jews to prevent them from being kidnapped by the sultan and converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.182-185&lt;/ref&gt; While Israel was not an immediate improvement over Yemen, Zionist agencies quickly began discussing an investnment in the future of the Yemenites, aiming to improve literacy, women's rights, health and social conditions. It was written in a Jewish Agency pamphlet that &quot;we must not allow them to become ... the shoeshine boys of our society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

Even years after the fact, opinions about the outcome of Operation Magic Carpet were mixed:

{{quote|There were Yemenite children who knew entire chapters of the Bible by heart, and I, a Hebrew teacher, taught them as if they didn't know any Hebrew, because their accent differed from mine. And what did I teach them?--The cat sat on the mat. I did them harm. Today I feel that it was a disaster, not only to the immigrants but to the entire community.|Rabbi Kalmann Kahana&lt;ref&gt;229&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|Nowhere in the world has there ever been such an educational enterprise, in such dimensions ... an entire educational system was created for them out of nothing, and it was done at a time of economic hardship, in the midst of an international struggle and a military threat against the very existence the state. That's what that was!|Dr. Baruch Ben-Yehuda&lt;ref&gt;229&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Government==
Government formed in 1948 included representatives from all the various segements of the          Zionist movement, religious factions, and anti-Zionists. to assure this unity, secular leaders had to make consessions           guaranteeing that aspects of Jewish law would be institutionalized        in the new government such as:  observance of Shabbos and dietary laws.

A constitution was first proposed in 1949. Leftists objected on the basis that the document did not declare              the basis of the State to be Socialism. Religious factions feared that a written consitution would cement          the values of secular Zionism. They argued that constitution was not necessary because the Torah was              in essence the constitution

U.S. officials were concerned that Israel might not be a democracy, as many Jews came from parts of the Soviet Union, and a large percentage of these were associated with socialist political parties and ideologies. American policymakers feared Israel would become a Soviet ally -           particularly those policymakers hostile toward Zionism in the  first place. The Soviet Union was key to the adoption of the partition resolution in the United Nations. The USSR was also second nation to recognize Israel, after the US.

Israeli government pursued some socialist economic policies: state ownership of major institutions             -airline             -telephone company             -utilities. But Israel was committed to the western democratic camp and had rejected          communism. As a result, the USSR then turned on Israel and supported Israel's enemies     politically, economically, and militarily

==Jordan==
    A. Before UN partition vote, Golda Meir was sent by Ben-Gurion to met with 
       King Abdullah
       i. they agreed Jews would not object to Adbullah annexing the area 
          allocated for the Arab State
       ii. Meir met Abdullah in Amman with the hope that Jordan would not 
           enter the impending war
       iii. Abdullah told Meir he allied himself with the other Arab states
    B. Jordan in Jerusalem
       i. Jordan heavily subsidized by British government and its army
       ii. Arab Legion was trained, supported and led by British officers
       iii. this Arab force was the one that the Jews were not able to expell 
            during the War of Independence
       iv. Transjordan was in control of a large amount of territory west of 
           the Jordan river AKA the West Bank and half of the city of 
           Jerusalem including the Old City
          a. Abdullah made it clear that the Jews were not allowed access to 
             holy places like the Kotel
          b. UN, Vatican, and other who had expressed concern as to the future 
             of Jerusalem and with it the freedom of all to worship there soon 
             did not keep interest
       v. Abdullah's decision to annex parts of Palestine that he conquered 
          angered fellow Arabs
          a. Abdullah ignored this and renamed the area the Hashemite Kingdom 
             of Jordan after his family the Hashemites
       vi. Israel doubled its poplation through immigration as Jordan did the 
           same by unifying the territory on both sides of the Jordan River
    C.  Interesting to Note
       i. on May 11, 1949 Israel was admitted as the 59th member on the UN
       ii. Jordan's application was vetoed by the Soviet Union two years 
           earlier because the Russians believed Abdullah was a British puppet

==Arab Boycott==
    A. declared on Dec. 9, 1945 by the Arab League Council
       i. stated &quot;Jewish products and manufactured goods shall be considered 
          undesirable to the Arab Countries.&quot;
       ii. this is before Israel was declared a State and even before the UN 
           voted for partition
       iii. Jewish was the term used as opposed to Zionist
    B. The boycott had three categories
       1. boycott prohibits direct trade between Israel and the Arab nations
       2. companies doing business in Israel
       3. blacklisting of firms that trade with other companies doing business 
          in Israel
          a. Coca-Cola was sold in Israel so Arabs countries boycotted the 
             company
          b. Pepsi stayed away from Israel and continued to do business in 
             Israel
    C. Economics in Israel
       i. at this time Israel did not have the resources to easily and quickly 
          absorb so many immigrants
       ii. years later many immigrants who grew up in ma'abarot -camps of tin 
           shacks and tents- harbored resentment towards the government for 
           its failure to ease their transition
    D. 1977 US Congress Prohibited US Companies From Cooperating With The Arab 
       Boycott
       i. President Carter
       ii. Carter mentioned that the boycott affected Jewish members of the 
           American society and that it was the antagonist to free trade
    E. US Foreign Policy
       i. Truman replaced by Eisenhower
         a. after 1948 War, Truman began a modest foreign aid program for 
            Israel, Ike quickly reduced that amount
         b. Ike used the aid to extract concessions from the Israelis 
            throughout his term
             -for example, 1955 payments were suspended to force Israel to 
              stop work on a hydroelectric project on the Jordan river
        c. Ike refused to sell weapons to Israel
        d. when Israel formally moved the foreign ministry and other       
           government institutions to the capital, Jerusalem, Eisenhower 
           criticized the decision and refused to move the US Embassy from Tel 
           Aviv - where it still remains!! [http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/IsraelUSEmbassy Petition]
    F. Eisenhower's New Middle East Policy Would Influence American 
       Decision-Makers For The Remainder Of The Century
       a. Ike decided that the Middle East was vital to American security 
          interests because of the oil reserves
       b. Ike also worried about the spread of Communism in Middle East
    G. Building of Alliances in the Middle East 
       a. Baghdad Pact 1955 - pro-Western regimes in Turkey and Iraq
       b. later that year Great Britain, Iran, and Pakistan joined creating 
          the Middle East Treaty Organization which later became the Central 
          Treaty Organization
       c. US wanted Egypt to become part of the Alliance
          -US prepared to offer Nasser arms and aid if his country joined
          -British opposed to this because of Suez
       d. Nasser actively opposed the alliance and began undermining it
       e. US did not join the Baghdad Pact
       f. Aswan Dam - 1955 Eisenhower offered to help Egypt build the Aswan 
          Dam
          -Nasser felt the project would give outsiders too much influence 
           over his economy
          -eventually Nasser decided to accept the offer in July 1956
          -July 19 US formally withdrew its offer
       g. a few days after Nasser learned of US withdrawal, Nasser nationalized 
          the Suez Canal
          -France and Great Britain were furious
          -US condemned Nasser but cautioned its allies against military  
           reaction
==Suez Canal==
    A. Egypt Closed the Suez Canal to Israeli Shipping After Signing the 
       Armistice Agreement
       i. August 9, 1949 UN Mixed Armistice Commission upheld Israel's 
          complaint that Egypt was illegally blocking the canal
       ii. September 1, 1967 the Security Council ordered Egypt to open the 
           canal to Israeli shipping
       iii. Egypt refused to comply
    B. Egypt &quot;attacks&quot; Israel
       i. 1955 Nasser began to import weapons from the Soviet Bloc to build 
          his arsenal for a confrontation with Israel
       ii. in the short-term Nasser used a different tactic announced on 
           August 31, 1955 &quot;Egypt has decided to dispatch her heroes, the 
           disciples of Pharaoh and the sons of Islam, and they will cleanse 
           the land of Palestine... There will be no peace on Israel's border 
           because we demand vengeance, and vengeance is Israel's death.&quot;
       iii. Egypt sent fedayeeh - Arab terrorists - trained and equipped by 
            Egyptian Intelligence to engage in hostile action on the border 
            and infiltrate Israel to commit acts of sabotage and murder
       iv. the fedayeen mostly operated from bases in Jordan so that Jordan 
           would feel the brunt of Israel's retaliation
       v. these terrorist attacks violated the armistice agreement yet the UN 
          Security Council condemned Israel for its counter-attacks
       vi. 1953 Israel had created a secret unit to retaliate against the 
           fedayeen
          -it infiltrated their bases and struck both preemptively and 
           vengefully
          -Unit 101, as it was called, was led by Ariel Sharon
       vii. Egyptian blockade of Straits of Tiran - Israel's only supply route 
            with Asia
       viii. Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in July, 1956
       ix. October 25, 1956 Egypt signed a tripartite agreement with Syria and 
           Jordan which put Nasser in command of the three armies
    B. Canal Plans
       i. British and French not happy with Nasser over situation
       ii. the French had grown close to new Israeli government; politically, 
           militarily, and diplomatically
          -French became Israel's primary source of arms for about a decade 
           and provided Israel key elements that let Israel develop a nuclear 
           capability
          -British still allied with Jordan and not friendly with Israel
       iii. French decided that they could use Israel's fear of Egyptian 
            aggression and the continuing blockade as a pretext for their own 
            strike against Nasser
       iv. British decided to join in
       v. the three countries agreed on a plan whereby Israel would land 
          paratroopers near the Canal and send its armor across the Sinai 
          dessert. The British and French troops would be deployed to 
          &quot;protect&quot; the canal
       vi. October 29, 1956 Israel attacked Egypt eighth days before the US 
           presidential election
       vii. more than 100,000 Israeli soldiers were mobilized in less than 72 
            hours and the air force was fully operational within 43. 
            Paratroopers landed in the Sinai and Israeli forces quickly 
            advanced unopposed toward the Suez Canal then halted in compliance 
            with the demands of England and France
       viii. the Egyptians ignored the Anglo-French ultimatum to withdraw 
             because they were asked to retreat from the Sinai to the west 
             bank of the canal, whereas the Israelis were permitted to stay 
             only 10 miles east of the canal
       ix. US sponsored a Security Resolution calling for an immediate Israeli
           withdrawal on October 30
       x. England and France vetoed the resolution
       xi. the next day France and England launched air operations, bombing 
           Egyptian airfields near Suez. Israeli forces continued fighting 
           after this. The IDF's armored corps swept across the dessert 
           capturing the entire Sinai peninsula by November 5
       xii. Nov. 5 British and French paratroops landed near Port Said and 
            amphibious ships dropped commandos onshore. British troops 
            captured Port Said and advanced within 25 miles of Suez city 
            before the British government abruptly agreed to a cease-fire
       xiii. by the end of the fighting, Israel had the Gaza Strip and had 
             advanced as far as Sharm al-Sheikh along the Red Sea
       ivx. a total of 231 Israeli soldiers died in the fighting

== Weapons to Israel==
    A. US/Kennedy
       i. main source of weapons to Israel was France
       ii. US encouragement of 3rd party arms suppliers that had enabled 
           Israel to meet its defense needs
       iii. US was supplying weapons directly like recoilless rifles to 
            Israel, but secretly
       iv. not until 1962 did Israel receive its first major weapons system 
           from US
           a. Kennedy agreed to sell HAWK anti-aircraft missiles
           b. state department opposed this but Kennedy justified this because 
              Nasser had been supplied long-range bombers from the Soviet 
              Union
           c. the HAWK system required IDF soldiers to be given extensive 
              training in the US and that spare parts be supplied to Israel
    B. Johnson
       i. almost immediately after inheriting the presidency, Johnson was 
          pressured by Israelis and lobbyists to supply Israel with tanks and 
          planes
       ii. 1964 Johnson Administration began to consider a tank sale, but the 
           Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that Israel had no need for tanks
           a. they felt US should place a higher priority on restraining the 
              flow of weapons to the Middle East
           b. Joint Chiefs of Staff said that if it was decided to sel tanks 
              then they should only be sold as replacements for obsolete tanks 
              and that they be supplied discreetly
           c. this became impossible when...
       iii. 1965 is was revealed that US had been indirectly supplying arms to 
            Israel via West Germany since 1962 under the terms of a secret 
            agreement made 1960
          a. Arab Nations resonded to this by threatening to recognize East 
             Germany and by pressuring West Germany to halt sales
          b. US stepped in to fulfill the remainder of the contract
       iv. US policy was of even-handedness
          a. it had a similar sale of tanks to Jordan
          b. the administration did not supply large amounts of weapons to 
             either the Arabs or Israelis
          c. Johnson did not want to provide one state with a military 
             advantage over another
       v. February 1966 the US State Department announced the sale of 200 
          Patton Tanks to Israel
       vi. then in May it announced a new agreement for Skyhawk jet bombers to 
           be supplied to Israel
          a. first sale of offensive weapons to Israel
          b. public acknowledgement that US was willing and actually providing 
             the weapons
== Beginning of PLO==

            formally came into being as an effort to give a voice to the 
            Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon
       iv. Nasser had some influence over these factions
       v. the key articles laid out in the Palestine National Charter or 
          Palestinian Covenant called for the destruction of Israel
    B. Fighting

      <text xml:space="preserve">At the beginning of 1967, Israel was facing multiple crises at once. An economic recession had drained consumer confidence. Large-scale immigration of [[w:Mizrahim|Mizrahim]] (Middle Eastern and Asian Jews) had created a class divide and sparked worry about Israel's future as a progressive, Western democracy. The atmosphere of the entire country was one of malaise and anxiety over the future of the Zionist project.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, not only did Israelis have cause for celebration, their attitude towards Zionist and foreign affairs had changed dramatically, and they had set a very different course for Israel on the international stage. Whether this was a change for the better, though, is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran politician Simha Flapan explained his concerns in retrospect:{{quote|With the blitz victory in 1967 and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, the sudden expansion of Israel's borders gave rise to a more rapid erosion of the socialist and humanist values that had once been the hallmark of labor Zionism: prominent political leaders, poets, writers, and intellectuals, whose roots had been in the labor movement, joined the new, dynamic [[w:Greater Israel|Greater Israel]] movement, which sought to turn Israel's most recent conquests into an integral part of the country.|Simha Flapan}}
==Build-up to war==
Jerusalem, ignored by the Tel Aviv elite, lay in a divided and sometimes quixotic state. Jordanian soldiers would fire on tourists taking pictures of them; adventurous scavengers sometimes stepped on land mines in the no-man's-land; Israeli Arabs could only meet their Palestinian relatives at irregularly determined times in a square between the [[w:Mandelbaum Gate|Mandelbaum Gate]] and its Jordanian counterpart; and the Western Wall was open only to foreign tourists, not even to the most pious Israeli.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Quarter of the Old City, under Jordanian control, was scheduled to be turned into a park. Fifty-two of the fifty-three synagogues in the Quarter were razed and turned into henhouses or horse stables.&lt;ref&gt;LETTER DATED 5 MARCH 1968 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF ISRAEL TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL&lt;/ref&gt;

PLO forms, 1964. Fatah begins bombings, 1965. Meanwhile, in 1963 the IDF had formed a plan code-named Whip to capture and occupy the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 1966, three Israeli soldiers are killed near Hebron. Israel responds with [[w:Samu Incident|Operation Shredder]], destroying dozens of homes and wounding or killing 100 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six-Day War==
On May 16, 1967, Nasser ordered UN peacekeepers to leave the Egyptian border, and Secretary [[w:U Thant|Thant]] complied. Israel considered this tantamount to declaring war. Putting the peacekeepers on the Israeli side of the border was not seriously considered because it would cause Israel to lose face. The Israeli cabinet, dominated by hawks, began preparing for war-- interestingly, the two most powerful individuals opposed to the war, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ben-Gurion, specifically refused to interfere with the war planning efforts. Johnson stayed out of discussions in order to maintain neutrality on Israeli politics, even though the cabinet spent three weeks trying to obtain approval or disapproval from him before finally deciding to declare war without it, and Ben-Gurion did the same because he had retired from politics, even though individual members of the Knesset were calling for him to be reinstated as prime minister to resolve the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp.225-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the general population of Israel, unaware of these back room deals, were panicking over the prospect of war, which most newspapers were reporting as inevitable. Runs on grocery stores cleared the aisles of bread and milk. Some Israelis fled overseas to live with relatives, and many dug trenches around their homes and installed bomb shelters in their basements. The tension throughout the country was palpable, although the soldiers guarding the front lines were much less fearful than civilians.&lt;ref&gt;op.cit&lt;/ref&gt;
===Day 1===
On June 5, the Israeli air force unexpectedly bombed the air forces of Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, demolishing 400 planes in less than 24 hours. Because this attack took the opposing forces by surprise and no resistance was put up, Israeli commanders considered the war virtually won by the day's end. Eshkol had offered King Hussein the option of staying out of the war (which would have left the West Bank and Jerusalem peaceful under Jordanian control), but surprisingly, he chose to launch shells at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv instead. Hussein's army was disorganized--&quot;amateurish&quot;, according to Odd Bull--and the Syrians did not even bother to counterattack. The Israelis, though, did sustain dozens of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp.338-350&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day 2===
On June 6, the cabinet seriously took up the matter of whether it was going to capture the Old City of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Both were a very dangerous prize: they were politically crucial to Jordan and full of impoverished refugees holding mortal grudges from the War of Independence, and yet once taken, the Israeli people would not permit the government to surrender them. Eshkol, considering these dangers, was hesitant to actually propose that the IDF march on Jerusalem. [[w:Menachem Begin|Menachem Begin]], who would later become Prime Minister, said that the IDF was charged with &quot;liberating the eastern part of western Eretz Israel&quot; (implying that Jordan itself would soon be &quot;liberated&quot;), and suggested that the entire Knesset march to the Western Wall with two rabbis and recite a prayer. General [[w:Moshe Dayan|Moshe Dayan]] offered a rather incautious compromise of surrounding the Old City without conquering it immediately, which was implicitly accepted when the meeting adjourned.&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp.351-365&lt;/ref&gt;
===Day 3===
On June 7, the Egyptian forces in Jerusalem had fled the city--only their abandoned shoes remained. Begin, impatient after hearing of a cease-fire, called Dayan, who impulsively ordered a march on Jerusalem (upsetting high-ranking generals stationed in other parts of the country, who wanted to be there for the historic event). At 10 in the morning Israeli flags were planted atop the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall, causing an impromptu celebration. Thousands of exuberant Israelis flooded the Old City. Zionists were punch-drunk on the feeling of victory: the chaplain of the IDF and soon to be Chief Rabbi of Israel, [[w:Shlomo Goren|Shlomo Goren]], advised General Uzi Narkis to demolish the Dome of the Rock. Narkis harshly rebuked him, and Dayan ordered the Israeli flag removed from the Dome. Meanwhile, Ben-Gurion's instinctive reaction on hearing the news was to begin resettling the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, and he began arranging for this immediately. When he saw a street sign near the Western Wall labelled &quot;Alborak&quot; in Arabic, he demanded that it be taken down, and although he had no political power nearby soldiers followed his orders. His other demand, to demolish the slums and public toilets near the wall, was carried out by Narkis before the end of the war. Narkis actually advised a contractors' association to demolish the houses so that Israel would not be legally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pp.366-384, 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
The final three days were comparatively inconsequential. An American spy vessel, the [[w:USS Liberty incident|USS Liberty]], was mistakenly attacked by the Israeli Air Force. Although some see a malicious motive in this attack, most historians (and both governments) consider it just one of many operational errors during the course of the war. The IDF seized the Golan Heights; Syria destroyed several kibbutzim in response. Both Jordan and Syria, apparently overwhelmed, requested a cease-fire, and in response Israel claimed more territory. After six days, Israeli forces were in position to march on Cairo, Damascus and Amman. The march was only halted because the Soviet Union was threatening to intervene in what appeared to be an immense upheaval in the fragile Middle Eastern balance of power. The US Secretary of State, Dean Rusk advised the Israelis to accept a cease-fire, and taking into consideration the costs of attacking the capitals, they did so on June 10.

During the war, 776 Israelis died, as did 15,000 Egyptians, 2,500 Syrians, and 800 Jordanians. Israel conquered enough land to triple the 8,000 square miles that it previously controlled to 26,000 square miles. More than 9,000 Palestinian families were reunited in 1967, and ultimately more than 60,000 Palestinians were allowed to return. But a new refugee population had been created and the old refugee problem was made worse. 90 percent of the Jordan Valley was evacuated by Palestinians who remembered the events of 1948. While these fears were mostly unfounded, in the villages of [[w:Qalqilyah|Qalqilyah]], [[w:Bayt 'Awa|Bayt 'Awa]], [[w:Hafla|Hafla]], [[w:Jifliq|Jifliq]], [[w:Bayt Nuba|Bayt Nuba]], [[w:Imwas|Imwas]], [[w:Yalu|Yalu]] and [[w:Bayt Mirsim|Bayt Mirsim]], IDF forces demolished hundreds of refugee homes and ordered their inhabitants to walk to somewhere else without any clear justification; some refugees from these towns wandered for four days without food or water, then were sent back to their homes only to watch them being demolished. During a cabinet meeting, Dayan expressed his hope that the entire West Bank would be evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;ibid., pp.405-409&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military victory and diplomatic defeat==
After the end of the war, Arab leaders convened to create a fierce diplomatic response to their defeat. They would no longer recognize Israel, and refuse to negotiate or settle a peace.

US under Johnson imposed an arms embargo on Israel and all of the         Middle East. Arabs later accused the US of airlifting supplied to Israel. France - Israel's main arms supplier also placed an embargo on           Israel. the Soviet Union supplied massive amounts of arms to the Arabs. the armies of Kuwait, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq contributed            to the Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian fronts

The UN Secretary Council unanimously passed a resolution on November          22, 1967 that was meant to provide guidelines for a peace            settlement, but Arabs interpreted the Resolution in a way that placed all the             responsibility for concessions of the Israelis and none on            themselves. The most controversial clause in [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] is the call for            the &quot;withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied            in the recent conflict&quot;. The word &quot;all&quot; is probably the most contentious word in this resolution, because it isn't there, and the opposing sides are fiercely opposed on whether it was meant to be. In fact, the word &quot;all&quot; was purposefully omitted by the Soviet delegation. The Arab states failed to add it to the resolution, but even today they consider the word &quot;all&quot; to be implied. 

{{quote|It would have been wrong to demand that Israel         return to its positions of June 4, 1967, because those              positions were undesirable and artificial.&quot;|Lord Caradon}}

On October 15, 1968 the PLO stated to the UN General Assembly that it        rejected Resolution 242. Israel accepted the resolution on May 1, 1968.

==The captured territories==
{{quote|The situation between us is like the complex relationship between a Bedouin man and the young girl he has taken against her wishes. But when their children are born, they will see the man as their father and the woman as their mother. The initial act will mean nothing to them. You, the Palestinians, as a nation, do not want us today, but we will change your attitude by imposing our presence upon you.|Dayan, to Palestinian poet Fadwa Tukan&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p.478&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1948, there were no disputed territories under Israel's control, excepting the fact that the Arab states disputed the very existence of Israel. In 1956, though, the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula were captured from Egypt. During Israel's swift victory in the Six-Day War, two new territories were added: the West Bank, home to millions Arabs who had been expelled from Israel in the War of Independence, and the Golan Heights, a sparsely inhabited area but strategically important due to its water resources. Obviously, it was not ideal for Israel to be occupying a region full of people who remembered their expulsion from their homes quite well and still demanded the right to return. It was widely acknowledged that Israel's occupation of all four of these territories could become a potential source of future disputes and violence. After the war ended, Israel attempted to make a deal with Egypt and Jordan, returning the Gaza Strip and West Bank to their control in return for legal recognition and peace negotiations. The involved countries rejected this offer unilaterally in the [[w:Khartoum Resolution|Khartoum Resolution]].

Instead of annexing the West Bank a military administration was created. The Israeli authorities tried to reduce the impact on the population by preventing incidents that might encourage the Arabs to leave their homes. In 1972, elections were held in the West Bank. Women and nonlandowners were now permitted to vote unlike during Jordanian rule. The Israeli government required that the school texts in the territories be purged of anti-semitism or anti-Jewish language. Farmers, having produced a record crop in 1967, were permitted to sell their produce in Jordan, sparking an &quot;open bridges&quot; policy. As the year crept on, though, the West Bank's economy became tied to Israel's. In 1968 the customs stations were shut down and the lira became the official currency.

Economic assistance was provided, for example, that some of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were moved from camps to new homes. Many Palestinians had fresh water and electricity in their homes for the first time. This brought about protests from Egypt which had done nothing for the refugees when it controlled the area, but preferred to have the Palestinians suffer so that Israel could be blamed for the poor conditions.

Palestinians were also given freedom of movement: they could travel to and from Jordan. East Jerusalem Arabs were allowed to choose whether or not they would retain their Jordanian citizenship or acquire Israeli citizenship.

==Conflict continues==
[[w:Munich massacre|Munich massacre]], [[w:Operation Wrath of God|Operation Wrath of God]]

==Egypt==
[[w:War of Attrition|War of Attrition]]
1971 President Anwar Sadat poised the proposition of signing an  agreement with Israel, so long as all of the occupied territories  captured by the Israelis were returned.

1972 At the Munich Summer Olympics, Palestinian terrorists  assasinated 11 Israeli athletes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/munich.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sadat stated that war was inevitable because there was no progress     towards peace; he claimed that he was prepared to sacrifice 1 million      soldiers in a war with Israel.

Sadat continued threatening war throughout 1972 - 1973 unless the          United States forced Israel to comply with his interpretation of the United Nations Resolution 242 {total withdrawl of Israeli forces  from territories gained during the 6-day war in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/un242.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While petition the US, Sadat built up a diplomatic offensive with         European and African states to aid his cause.

April 1973 during an interview, Sadat warned that he would renew        the war with Israel, but because of his previous threats pretty much        no one expected war.
===Israel begins to prepare for war===
On October 5, 1973 Israelis began preparing for the imminent war.. At 5:00am General David Elazar, the chief of staff, was the first      to recommend mobilization of forces and a preemptive air strike. This was overruled. A few hours passed and a partial call-up of the reserves was approved. Prime Minister, Golda Meir, still did not authorize Elazar to take        military action.  Meir advised the the US ambassador of the situation and asked that          he pass on the message that the Arabs should be restrained. US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, then appealed to Sadat and        the Syrian President Hafez Assad not to do anything rash. Kissinger also warned Meir not to shoot first.

Israel's chances for victory and having less casualties would be       better if Israel launched a preemptive strike along with the rapid       mobilization of the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), however, Meir feared       that by striking first, the US would be angered and Nixon might not       support Israel's policies or Israel during the war.&lt;ref&gt;       [http://www.adl.org/ISRAEL/Record/yomkippur.asp Source3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/1973toc.html Source4]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gochugaru''' (고추가루, also transliterated as '''go choo ga roo''') is red [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|chili pepper]], dried and ground into a coarse powder.  In preparing [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean]] dishes, just about any ground chili pepper may be used as a substitution, but be aware that several varieties of chili powder (such as [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]) can be quite a bit hotter or milder than gochugaru, and so it is advisable to add in small amounts until the desired level of spiciness is reached.</text>

== Definition ==
''bridi'' is the concept of sentences can be composed by the use of a predicate and several called ''arguments''.

A predicate together with its arguments (called ''sumti'') is a ''bridi''. A ''bridi'''s relations are expressed by a ''brivla''.

== Example ==

The statement '''mi prenu''' (I'm a person) is a ''bridi'' where '''x1 prenu''' is a ''brivla'' and '''mi''' is the ''sumti'' of the ''brivla''.

'''Foley''' sound is the technical term for the recreation of sound effects for a movie in a studio. Named after Jack Foley, the inventor of this technique,[http://atlantamusicgroup.com/foley1.html] it entails replacement and addition of sound in a film. Foley sound is created by an industry professional known as the foley-artist. Usually this is done in a recording studio known as a Foley Stage with the film being played back and interlocked to an audio recording device while the artist watches the picture and uses sometimes unusal articles and techniques to match picture.

Foley sounds may include as much as a: the dry ''smack'' of a punch, the ''revving'' engine of a car, or the ''crashing'' waves of the sea.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|US Cuisine]]

This is the traditional old-fashioned [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] [[w:Pie|pie]] with a gel-like filling. If you want a sticky filling, use this [[Cookbook:British Lemon Meringue Pie|recipe]]  instead.

==Ingredients==

===Pie filling===
*1½ (360ml) cups cold water
*1 cup (240g) white granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 tablespoons all purpose flour
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
*1/4 teaspoon salt
*1/2 cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] (from about 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]] or bottled lemon juice)
*1 tablespoon lemon [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] (from about 2 lemons)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*4 egg yolks, beaten
*1/8 teaspoon turmeric

===Meringue===
*4 egg whites
*¼ tsp cream of tartar
*6 tablespoons white granulated sugar


==Procedure==
===Pie Crust===
#Prepare [[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust|Grandma's Pie Crust]] or a ready-made refrigerated or frozen pie crust.

===Pie filling===
#In a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] together water, sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, turmeric, lemon juice and lemon zest. Make sure any flour or cornstarch lumps are stirred until they dissolve.
#Cook over medium heat until mixture starts to [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]]. Stir constantly.
#Add butter, stir until melted.
#Beat egg yolks in a small bowl. Add about ½ cup (120g) of hot lemon mixture into eggs and stir well. This tempers the egg yolks so they won't [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scramble]] when added to the simmering lemon mixture.
#Pour tempered egg mixture into pan of simmering lemon mixture. Stir until well mixed.
#Continue simmering lemon filling about 2 minutes until it thickens, stirring constantly.
#Pour into cooked pie shell and allow to cool while preparing meringue.

===Meringue===
#Place 4 egg whites in [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] and beat at high speed until they start to foam.
#Add cream of tartar to egg whites then, while continuing to beat, add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat about 30 seconds between tablespoonfuls of sugar.
#Continue to beat meringue until stiff peaks form when beaters are raised from bowl.
#Spread meringue over pie, starting on lemon pie filling, using rubber [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]]. Spread over edges of crust, completely sealing in the lemon pie filling.
#To form peaks in meringue, using a rubber spatula, touch flat side of spatula on meringue and pull away. Repeat over entire surface of meringue.
#Place pie in [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F]] (180°C) oven for 15 minutes until high points of meringue are lightly browned.
#Serve at room temperature or chilled.

==Warnings==
* The pie filling is quite hot when pouring it into pie shell. 
* Keep this pie refrigerated.
* In humid weather meringue may &quot;weep&quot; (small dots of liquid form on the surface). To lessen this possibility, apply meringue to lemon filling while it is still hot, cool pie to room temperature before refrigerating, and/or use confectioner's (powdered -- 4X or 10X) sugar instead of granulated sugar when making the meringue.

== Behavioral Decisions ==

Behavioral decision research is concerned with how people make judgments and choices, and with how the processes of decision might be improved. The field of behavioral decision research is intensely interdisciplinary, employing concepts and tools from psychology, economics, statistics, and other disciplines. 

Recently, experimental research on judgment and choice was said to be “psychology’s leading intellectual export to the social sciences as well as to a host of applied fields” (Tetlock, 2002, Psychological Review). 

Studies in the psychology of individual choice have identified numerous cognitive, informational, temporal, and other limitations which bound human rationality, often producing systematic errors and biases in judgment and choice. One of the greatest factors in forming any decision is a perception of the decision maker. Perception is a process by which individuals organize and interpret their sensory impressions in order to give meaning to their environment. People’s behavior is based on their perception of what reality is, not on reality itself i.e. the world as it is perceived is the world that is behaviorally important.

== Types ==

There are three types of factors that influence perception:
#Factors in the perceiver:
*Attitudes
*Motives
*Experiences
*Interests
*Expectations
#Factors in the situation: 
*Time
*Work setting
*Social Setting 
#Factors in the target:
*Novelty
*Motion
*Sounds
*Size
*Background
*Proximity
*Similarity

When individuals observe behavior, they attempt to determine whether it is internally or externally caused. This is the essence of attribution theory. When the individual behavior is observed there are three types of interpretation of this behavior, according to the attribution theory: (1) Distinctiveness: different behaviors in different situations; (2) Consensus: response is the same as others to same situation: (3) Consistency: response is the same over time.

== Errors ==

As is the case with most theories, errors and biases are possible in the attribution theory. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal factors when making judgments about the behavior of others. Self-serving bias is the tendency for individuals to attribute their own successes to internal factors while putting the blame for failures on external factors. 

== Perception and Decision ==

There is an obvious link between perception and decision. Decision is passed through a prism of individual decision-maker’s perception. This decision-making was (and still is) the subject of research of multiple disciplines. Few prominent decision-making models emerged.  One that has been described and used the most is the Rational Decision- Making Model, which describes how individuals should behave in order to maximize some outcome. Economists favor theories based on axioms of rational choice. Decision-making behavior is assumed to be rational and consistent. Agents maximize utility or profits, and the information required to do so is either freely available or optimally purchased. In the most extreme form, exemplified today by rational expectations models, agents have perfect models of the economy and never systematically err. However, in order for this model to work, it should be in conformance with numerous assumptions: 
*Problem is clear,
*Options are known, 
*Preferences are clear and constant, 
*No time or cost constraints are present, and
*Maximum payoff.

== Steps to a Decision ==

Steps in the rational decision-making model are: 
#Define the problem.
#Identify the decision criteria.
#Allocate weights to the criteria.
#Develop the alternatives.
#Evaluate the alternatives.
#Select the best alternative.

However, we can judge from our experiences that people are not always rational, nor that they behave in the rational manner. To support this observation psychologists have documented numerous experimental results of departures from optimal behavior in a wide variety of decision-making tasks. 

== Limitations ==

Rationality is bounded by limitations of information, time, and cognitive capability. This is what Herbert Simon referred to as bounded rationality. Individuals make decisions by constructing simplified models that extract the essential features from problems without capturing all their complexity. This bounded rationality influences how the decisions are made in the organizations. 

In a 1981 review Hogarth laments the &quot;insufficient attention&quot; paid &quot;to the effects of feedback between organism and environment.&quot; By feedback is meant not merely outcome feedback but changes in the environment, in the conditions of choice, which are caused, directly and indirectly, by a subject's past actions. For example, a firm's decision to increase production feeds back through the market to influence the price of goods, profits, and demand; greater output may tighten the markets for labor and materials; competitors may react - all influencing future production decisions. Such multiple feedbacks are the norm rather than the exception in real problems of choice. As a result it has been difficult for behavioral decision theory to make much headway in analyzing the dynamics of aggregate organizations such as a firm or industry.

== Types of People ==

Decision Theory does not in general provide a good description of people's decision behavior. Under some conditions Decision Theory may be approximately accurate: especially when experienced people are making consequential decisions (financial investors, lawyers negotiating a law suit settlement, etc.). But, even in these situations there are many violations of &quot;rationality.&quot; Compared to Decision Theory's predictions, people are:

Boundedly Rational
*they violate &quot;obviously rational&quot; axioms
*they cannot &quot;cognitively compute&quot; all the probability X payoff values

Boundedly Selfish
*they care about fairness
*they are altruistic 
*have Bounded Self-Control</text>

==Introduction==
This not a complete history of [[Wikipedia:Symbian|SymbianOS]] but in fact a summary of SymbianOS so that we as J2ME developers can determine what optional APIs we have access to by Operating System version and devices series version within the SymbianOS ecological infrastructure.

There are two main device platforms that are deployed on top of SymbianOS. [[Wikipedia:Nokia|Nokia]] created Series60 and licensed it to others like Samsung. [[Wikipedia:UIQ|UIQ(a Pen Based UI for Symbian)]] is a joint effort between Sony-Ericsson, Motorola and Symbian Ltd.

==Base Set of MIDP, SymbianOS==
A brief footnote before we begin on the J2ME Platform. Before the J2ME Platform SymbianOS came with two other Java platforms, embedded java on SymbianOS 5 and the personal java and javaphone combination on SymbianOS 6.  Thus, PersonalJava and JavaPhone before the Personal Profile will be mentioned here to be accurate of what OS versions have that combination. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Although the underlying OS does not limit Heap size, persistent storage, and etc on the later versions of Symbian the JSRs do limit the jar, jad, and persistent storage sizes in the form of JSR 185(JTWI).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

===SymbianOS 6.x===
In 2002 MIDP 1.0 was back ported to SymbianOS 6 versions. The SymbianOS versions that MIDP 1.0 was back ported to are SymbianOS 6.0 and SymbianOS 6.1({{Web reference|title=Standard Java|work=Symbian On Java|URL=http://www.symbian.com/technology/standard-java.html}})

Thus, we only have basic MIDP 1.0 on SymbianOS 6.0 and SymbianOS 6.1 on devices 2002 and onward.
*MIDP
**MIDP 1.0 except pausedApp is never called contrary to the MIDP 1.0 specification.
**CLDC 1.0
**Sun's KVM

*Personal Java(pre Personal Profile)
**Modified Personal Java 3.0.x(PesonalJava Application Environment 1.1.1a)
**JDVMI for debug support over TCP/IP connection
*JavaPhone 1.0
**JavaPhone 1.0 APIs

**Java Telephony API(JTAPI)
**Java Telephony Mobile

===SymbianOS 7.0s===
In this version of SymbianOS 7, MIDP 2.0 was introduced({{Web reference|title=Symbos-v7s|work=Symbian OS Version 7.0s
functional description|URL=http://www.symbian.com/technology/symbos-v7s-det.html}}) This MIDP 2.0 implementation includes:

'''Wheat''' is a grain which is the basis of many different kinds of food. Ground into [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] it is the basis for most of the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] and [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] eaten in the world. The whole grains can be boiled and used like rice. With some processing, wheat is converted into [[Cookbook:Couscous|couscous]] and [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulgur wheat]], which both are easier to cook and used like rice.

Wheat berries (unprocessed seed) are also grown to make [[Cookbook:Wheat grass juice|wheat grass juice]].

[[Image:Zest Grater.jpg|thumb|right|A zest grater]]

'''Zest''' is the coloured outer surface of [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]; zesting is the act of scraping the zest from the fruit. A [[Cookbook:Zester|zester]] is ideal for the task. Some people use a [[Cookbook:Knife|serrated knife]] instead. Alternatively, the careful application of a fine-toothed [[Cookbook:Grater|grater]] works well (pictured is a grater specifically designed for zesting). Dried zest is sometimes sold alongside [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]].

A '''zester''' is a tool for removing [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]]. A common design would be a foot-shaped blade sticking out of a handle, sharp along the toe edge, and with little holes in the toe area. This a scraped over the peel (rind) of a [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] to remove strips of zest.</text>

Dried '''bonito flakes''', known as ''katsuo-bushi'' or ''katsuobushi'' in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]], are flakes of dried, smoked bonito [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]. They look similar to wood shavings. The &quot;bonito&quot; is a type of [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], but may not be marketed as tuna in many countries.

Bonito flakes are used to make ''katsuobushi-dashi'', the second most favored type of [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] (Japanese [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]) for [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]]. Bonito flakes are also used for [[Cookbook:Onigiri|onigiri]] filling and to make ponzu sauce.

{{wikipedia|Katsuobushi}}

Bonito flakes are also marketed as cat treats in the United States, primarily in specialty pet stores.</text>

The kernel started as very old BSD. The MACH microkernel disaster was added, taking over memory management and task handling among other things. This was the NeXT kernel. Then lots of NetBSD code was added to modernize things a bit.

Userspace took a similar path, but being modernized mostly with FreeBSD and GNU code.

'''Lardons''' are bits of [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] that can be injected into a tough piece of meat prior to cooking. The injection of lardons is called larding.

In French cuisine, lardons are blocks of bacon, cut in a cuboid shape, about 3 to 4 cm long and a little less that 1 cm wide on the other 2 sides.

Any feedback on the recipe?
:yeah, sucks
::Please explain in which way this recipe sucks so I can clarify parts of, or ammend, the recipe to help others.

:This is a very odd recipe!  You can't seriously mean 1 cup of weed, that's a ridiculous amount.  This is more like a very odd sort of... scone recipe.  The recipe can't be right with water in it, and no eggs or at least milk.  It can't rise at all... I really suggest just your classic victoria-spongey style recipe with say an 8th of weed in it.  A cup of weed?  No way, how much would that cost!!!?  Admittedly I haven't made this recipe, but just looking at it firstly saying a cup of weed from the fact it has loads of water in and no eggs, it's just clearly wrong.  Baking at 300 degrees is also crazy- 220 at most for almost any sort of baking.

Ive been making cakes every weekend for the last couple of months, for 8 cakes I use 3.5g of weed, 3g in the mix and then the rest mixed into the sauce for the top, but that other guy is right, if you go over 200*c it burns, fast.  I had it on 250*c and within 10mins it was burnt to funk

::Also agree. A cup of weed, roughly speaking and obviously depending on quality, would cost upwards of $200. That is an insane amount, and no more then 3.5g should be used bottom line.

==Suggestions==
Any suggestions for things to add?


This recipe works a dream just dont use a cup of mahjurana use around an eighth and make the recipe to your own calculatons weighed by eye and it turns out fine!!!!!!!!!!!

== Warning ==

Should that warning and disclaimer be added to the Rum Balls?

==Feedback==

Please add any observations you have had with this recipe to the discussion page, as well as any ideas or different methods you have attempted. I would also like to convert this recipe to organic and wheat-free versions, so if anyone has the proportions one would need to adjust for the different ingredients, please edit this article and add them accordingly or put them in the diuscussion page and someone else can format them in properly.

&lt;b&gt;Feedback From A_o_D&lt;/b&gt;

So, i cooked this 'space cake' and it was great!:)

I fixed up this article. I deleted errors, and gave a good explanation. 

The biggest error that was in the text was that:
1. the dots are not usually used to read or write Arabic
The truth is they are always used nowadays. Just open a book, and you will see the dots. They were not in the pre-islamic era, and during the Early islamic era.

THOSE Dots do not indicate vowels. They differentiate one constanant from others that are written with the same shape.

I believe that the person who wrote the article is confusing the dots with the signs used to indicate vowels. The signs used to indicate vowels are loops, and lines, there is a sign for the lack of a vowel, and there is also a sign for the gemination of a constanant. These symbols are the ones viewed as mostly superfluos to anyone fluent in reading arabic.

--------
I just wanted to clean up the text a little bit. The general message was there, although not readily understood.

Feel free to improve on this all you want.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.6x}}

The render settings control various options related to the output of rendered, or full quality images. Rendering an image will calculate effects not displayed in the editing environment (due to their complexity), and therefore takes a larger amount of time to produce an image. If you notice an error partway through a render, then you can press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}} to abort the render.

==The Render Settings==

Let's take a look at all of the rendering options that Blender has.  Open up a new scene ('''CTRL + N''') and click on the camera icon in the Properties window to get to the rendering context. You should see something that looks like the image on the left.[[Image: Render Settings.png|left|The default render settings.]]

These are the default settings for Blender Internal.  Let's take a look at all of these settings and see what they do.

==Render Layers and Render Passes==

[[Image:Render_Layers_tab.png|thumb|230px|right|Render Layers]]
Render layers are a way of organising data so that you can edit the render selectively after it's finished. This requires different objects to be on different scene layers, and each scene layer usually has it's own render layer (though this is arbitrary).

Render passes are different types of data that make up an image, separated and put into it's own 'pass' that you can use to change the render selectively. This is extremely common when using Blender's compositor to do post-processing.

For example, let's say that you want to composite a 3D object from Blender into a video that you shot. In order to make the shadows from the render affect the footage, you would enable ambient occlusion and select the 'AO' pass as shown in the image on the right. You then would have an AO pass in addition to the combined render. You could then multiply the AO pass over the footage in the compositor in order to make shadows from Blender appear in your footage.
If you had separated your image into different color passes then you could edit each color pass to make the colors match the footage.

Of course, you could also use the render passes/layers to make post-processing easier in completely digital scenes. e.g. use the Index Object pass to make a glare effect on a particular object. The index object pass creates a greyscale mask for an object that you can plug into the 'Factor' input of the glare node, this makes the glare effect occur only for that object.


{{clear}}
==Dimensions and Anti-aliasing==
[[Image:Dimensions_and_antiAliasing.png|thumb|281px|left|Dimensions &amp; Anti-aliasing]]

As you can see in the image on the left, below the render layer settings we have the dimensions and anti-aliasing settings.

The dimension settings are pretty simple: the X slider defines the width (in pixels) of your render, the Y slider defines the height (also in pixels) of your render. Above the X/Y sliders is a menu with some handy presets for commonly used resolutions, such as 1080p, 720p, and different TV resolutions. Below the X/Y sliders is another slider showing a percentage, the percentage indicates what size the render will be compared to the X/Y values. In the screenshot the slider is at 50%, so the scene will be rendered at half the size of the full resolution (in this case half the size of 1080p). This is a very easy way to quickly change the size of your render without worrying about numbers.

==Render==

[[Image:Render tab.png|thumb|280px|right|Render tab]]

Now, let's move on to the render tab!  The first thing you should notice is the VERY BIG button that says 'Render' on it.  This button performs the same action as the '''F12''' button.  Below this is a drop-down box, allowing you to change between the Blender Internal Render engine and YAFRAY.  (For more on YAFRAY, see [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Yafray Render Options|YAFRAY Render Options]]).  Next to the 'Render' button are 5 buttons: Shadow, Env Map, Pano, Ray, Radio.  These are explained in detail below:
*Shadow:  Lights will cast shadows.  If this is turned off, nothing will cast a shadow.  To see this, add a plane below your default cube and render.  Now turn this button off and see how there are no shadows.
*EnvMap: Use the environment map. 
*Pano: This enables panoramic rendering.  For more on panoramic rendering, see [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Looking_All_Around_-_Panorama_Settings|Panorama Settings]]
*Ray: This enables Ray Tracing. Turn it off, and render the same images as I talked about in the description of the Shadow button.  &quot;What!?&quot;  you say.  &quot;That did the same thing as turning off the shadows!  What's the deal?&quot;  Well, ray tracing is used to calculate how light goes through objects like glass and stuff. It also has something to do with shadows.
*Radio: This stands for Radiosity.  

Moving on, the next button we come to is the 'OSA' button.  For the use of this button, see [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/OSA|OSA]]

To the right of the OSA button, are some percentages.  These will set the renderer to render at the specified percent of the resolution that you have set.  (We'll come to resolution later)  For an experiment, press the '50%' button.  As you can see, Blender renders the image at 50% of the set resolution.  This is an easy way to make a quick render.

Next on our tour, we come to two boxes labeled 'Xparts' and 'Yparts'.  These buttons change the number of boxes that Blender will render in total.  Play around with these to see how they change the number of small boxes in the render window when you render.

==Anim / Bake==

The final tab we'll (briefly) cover is the Anim(Animation) tab.  If you have made an animation, pressing the 'ANIM' button will render your  animation. Right below it are two buttons, Do Sequence and Do Composite. The Do Sequence button will render your animation with any effects you have done in the Sequence Editor and the Do Composite button will render an animation with your composite node work included.
The Sta: and End: are the start and end frame numbers. The default setting is that your animation will start at frame 1, and will end at frame 250.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vosotros is the informal way to address a group including the person you are talking to. In English, we do this in various ways: y´all, you guys, all you, you all, yous guys, etc - depending on the region from which we originate. Vosotros is similar; with usage varying geographically as with the English expressions. This verb form is generally only used in Spain, and using it anywhere else (Latin America, the Caribbean, and Mexico, for example) will attract some very funny looks. It is usually used in a very informal way to address a group of people and implies that not one of the persons in the group would deserve an ''Usted'' title in singular conversation. In all situations where ''vosotros'' is not appropriate, you would use ''ustedes'' to address more than one person.

However, ''vosotros'' is also used in some more formal written forms on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, Biblical passages typically use ''vosotros'' forms when the speaker is addressing multiple people. You will regularly see and hear ''vosotros'' in Biblical quotes wherever you are. Therefore, you may want to at least recognize the usage even if you don't know how to use it yourself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This conjugation is the equivalent of -ing in English (ex. '''I am talking.''' ''Estoy hablando.'') 

*It is used to indicate an action that is continuous.
*for -er and -ir verbs the suffix is -iendo
*for -ar verbs the suffix is -ando 

*Examples:
Escribir---&gt;Escribiendo          ''writing''&lt;br&gt;
Correr-----&gt;Corriendo            ''running''&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The individualism sub-ideology of liberalism is the ideal of the individual being of more importance than the collective. In modern western culture, it is often overlooked, however in feudal societies this was highly important to those without any individual freedoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like English nouns, the Swedish nouns are declined according to number: they're either singular or plural. Unlike English, however, Swedish nouns are also declined according to article (&quot;the car&quot; versus &quot;a car&quot;). Instead of a definite article - &quot;the&quot; in the case of English - Swedish uses suffixes. We will see how this works later on.

==Gender==

The North Germanic languages, to which Swedish belongs, originally had three genders: masculine (''maskulinum''), feminine (''femininum'') and neuter (''neutrum''). However, as the language evolved, the first two were merged into a &quot;real gender&quot; (''realgenus'') or common (''utrum''). In practice, this means Swedish has what we might call two flavours of &quot;it&quot;, which can complicate matters. 


===Common - uter===
*en stol - a chair
*stolen - the chair
*en ny stol - a new chair
*den nya stolen - the new chair
*stolar - chairs
*stolarna - the chairs
*nya stolar - new chairs
*de nya stolarna - the new chairs

===Neuter===
*ett bord - a table
*bordet - the table
*ett nytt bord - a new table
*det nya bordet - the new table
*två bord - two tables
*borden - the tables
*nya bord - new tables
*de nya borden - the new tables


The gender of a noun does not only affect the noun itself but also adjectives describing the noun, definite articles and singular indefinite articles. 

As a rule, the gender of a noun cannot be figured out just by looking at spelling. Some nouns, however, like ''barn'' (child) and ''djur'' (animal) are understandably neuters because they refer to both masculine and feminine things.

There are two generalizations that might be helpful to know:
almost all nouns that end with an &quot;-a&quot; belong to the common gender, and most words that remain unchanged in the plural form (for example: &quot;a tire, several tires&quot; becomes &quot;ett däck, flera däck&quot;) are neuter nouns;
the only clear &quot;-a&quot;-ending exceptions to the common form are the words &quot;ett öga&quot; (&quot;an eye&quot;), &quot;ett öra&quot; (&quot;an ear&quot;) and &quot;ett hjärta&quot; (&quot;a heart&quot;).

==Definiteness==

A ''definite'' noun in English takes the ''definite'' article ''the'', and an ''indefinite'' noun takes the ''indefinite'' articles ''a'' or ''an''.  As far as indefinite nouns are concerned, things are very similar in Swedish.

The indefinite articles are ''en'' and ''ett''.  A neuter noun takes ''ett'' and a common noun takes ''en''.
*ett bord - a table
*en stol - a chair

The definite articles in Swedish are attached to the ''end'' of the noun as a ''suffix''.  The neuter suffix is ''-et'' and the common suffix is ''-en''.
*bordet - the table
*stolen - the chair

In addition to these two suffixes, Swedish also has two further definite articles which are much more similar to English ''the''.  The articles are used when you want to use an ''adjective'' (a word which ''describes'' a noun like green, big, old, etc) with the definite noun.  The common article is ''den'' and the neuter is ''det''.

*det nya bordet - the new table
*den nya stolen - the new chair

Notice that the nouns still have the definite suffix attached, which might appear slightly awkward in English. For example, the example ''det nya bordet'' mentioned above literally translates as ''The new the table'', which is nonsencial in English but fully correct in Swedish. Note that some fixed expresssions tend to drop the first ''the'', as for example ''svenska folket'' (the Swedish people). Adjectives decline for number and gender, but that will be looked at in greater detail elsewhere.

==Number==

Swedish boasts no less than six different pluralization suffixes, two of which are used in both genders. In the common gender, it's often hard to know which one to use together with a certain noun. The -s plural suffix is never used in Swedish.

Though it is important to remember that there are always exceptions, and there are words with complete irregularity, like &quot;gås&quot; (goose) and &quot;gäss&quot; (geese).

'''Common:'''
===-er===
* bild &gt; bilder (picture &gt; pictures)

===-ar===
* båt &gt; båtar (boat &gt; boats)
* stege &gt; stegar (ladder &gt; ladders)

===-or===
* flicka &gt; flickor (girl &gt; girls)

===-r===
* sko &gt; skor (shoe &gt; shoes)

===-0 (no suffix) ===
* bagare &gt; bagare (baker &gt; bakers)
[only used with titles, occupations etc. ending in unstressed ''-are'']

'''Neuter:'''
===-0 (no suffix)=== 
* hus &gt; hus (house &gt; houses)

===-n===
* äpple &gt; äpplen (apple &gt; apples)

===-er===
* bageri &gt; bagerier (bakery &gt; bakeries)
[only used with words ending in stressed -''eri'']

==The plural definite==
In Swedish the plural definite articles are ''-en'' and ''-na''. 

* borden - the tables
* stolarna - the chairs
* husen - the houses

As you can see, ''-en'' was also used as one of the definite articles. This can produce confusion as a person might want to say ''the table'' and think that he should use the ''-en'' as definite article: ''borden''. That would however lead to saying ''the tables''.

'''Superfine sugar''' is also known as '''bar sugar''' (so-named for use in mixing alcoholic drinks) or '''baking sugar'''. It is [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]] with unusually small crystals. Sold as [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar or castor sugar]], this is the standard type of sugar in some parts of the world.

Superfine sugar crystals are easy to disolve in cold liquids.  This property also causes doughs, [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringues]] and batters made with superfine sugar to be of a finer texture than is usually achieved with granulated sugar.

Superfine sugar is ''not'' the same as [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar, confectioners' sugar, and icing sugar]]. A [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] can be used (abused) to create a decent approximation of superfine sugar from granulated sugar. Depending on the recipe, it may be acceptable to simply substitute either granulated sugar or powdered sugar.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to the Knowledge Management Wiki Page==

This Wiki Page provides an overview of the basic concepts of Knowledge Managemment (KM).&lt;br&gt;
The history, people and specific technology of KM are '''not''' covered here.&lt;br&gt;
Sections on the different types of KM systems do '''not''' necessarily appear in historical order.


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Basic Concepts of Knowledge Management (KM) ==

===What is the goal of KM?===

The goal of KM is to make knowledge accessible for rapid response to emerging situations. A practical KM system therefore enables workers to efficiently reuse the knowledge of an organization rather than to waste time recreating redundant knowledge.

===What is the cycle of KM?===

'''Collection'''&lt;br&gt;

KM people and systems should capture new knowledge as it is generated by an organisation. 

The KM system must therefore provide a convenient format for reporting new knowledge.

'''Organization'''&lt;br&gt;

KM systems provide a structure for organization that facilitates both storage and retrieval of new knowledge. 

Organization of knowledge supports the main goal of KM which is provide easy access to knowledge for reuse.

'''Refinement'''&lt;br&gt;

KM knowledge bases must be uncluttered. 

Obsolete knowledge must be removed; redundant examples must be removed; errors must be corrected. Systematic maintenance takes planning and the allocation of time.

===What defines the term &quot;knowledge&quot; within KM?===

KM is a system for managing knowledge within specific organizations. KM therefore covers '''proprietary''' processes, procedures, histories and the lessons learned during the operation of a given organization. The knowledge bases managed by KM systems are therefore finite and focused, as opposed to the general knowledge bases stored in library systems and the universe of information and misinformation that is published on the World Wide Web. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Www www].&lt;br&gt;

===Where does organizational knowledge come from?===

'''Creative Activities'''&lt;br&gt;
Organizations generate new knowledge through activity. Organizations create designs, processes, procedures, and reports in order to improve operations, serve clients, and conform to regulations.


'''Problem Solving Activities'''&lt;br&gt;
All organizations must solve problems. The list includes legal problems, production problems, labor problems, and customer problems. Problem solving activities generate reusable knowledge such as problem-prevention knowledge and problem-solving strategies.

'''Reuse of Existing Knowledge'''&lt;br&gt;
The '''reuse''' of existing knowledge also generates new knowledge. Old case studies can be reused to generate new solutions; old trends can be analyzed to generate new forecasting tools. New knowledge often descends from established knowledge.

===Intranets as Knowledge Management Systems===

'''Intranets - by Natural Progression'''&lt;br&gt;
When companies began to develop their intranets, it began as an Internet-based private-secure networked environment where divisions, departments and employees could store, retrieve, publish, and share information.  As time when on the intranet began to build its repository of information and thus it started becoming a valuable repository of knowledge.  Once search engine capabilities were added to the intranet, accessibility to the information and knowledge became more structured and easy to locate, sort and retrieve.  Therefore, by natural progression, Intranet sites are becoming knowledge management systems.  For more information, read the article by Steven L. Telleen, Ph.D. [[http://www.iorg.com/papers/knowledge.html Intranets as Knowledge Management Systems]]


===Why is KM needed?===

Effective Knowledge Management ensure that the right information is available to the right person at the right time.

'''Workforce Turnover'''&lt;br&gt;
When employees leave an organization they take valuable knowledge with them.

'''Limitations of Human Memory'''&lt;br&gt;
Employees rapidly move from project to project. The details of past activities are often forgotten. Also, human memory can be self-corrupting, because people will unconsciously alter their knowledge to make things logical or acceptable within their own contexts.

'''Poor Communications'''&lt;br&gt;
Corporate microsystems can be competitive and self-insulating. One brand-management team may create an effective marketing strategy, and then neglect to share that new strategy with another brand-management team in the same organization.


===How is a KM professional’s definition of KM substantively different than a typical dictionary definition of that word?===

The Webster's New Millennium™ Dictionary of English (2005) defines knowledge management (KM) as the technologies involved in creating, disseminating, and utilizing knowledge data. Tiwana (2002) states “KM enables the creation, distribution, and exploitation of knowledge to create and retain greater value from core business competencies.&quot; The substantive difference between these definitions is the dictionary definition does not focus on the outcome of KM. That is, to retain value from business knowledge.  The value can be the benefit of using knowledge to adjust to change or using knowledge to avoid making the same mistakes again.

===What is epistemology, and why is that subject mentioned in relation to KM?===

The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language (2000) defines epistemology as the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and validity.  Epistemology is mentioned in relation to knowledge management (KM) because KM deals with the management of knowledge.  Thus it is imperative to understand the nature of knowledge in order to manage it.  In addition epistemology deals with validity or strength of knowledge.  Thus epistemology can assist KM practitioners in categorizing knowledge on a scale of weak to strong.  Thus a KM practitioner can use ideas from the study of knowledge to better manage knowledge in an organization. 
 
===What is “innovative nonexploiters”?===

Innovative nonexploiters are companies or organizations that have innovations or are innovators but do not exploit or take advantage of their innovations.  Example of innovative nonexploiters would be companies that have innovation but are weak exploiter of their own innovation or knowledge.  The outcome of being an innovative nonexploiter could be negative, to the company, if external forces take advantage of the knowledge or innovation and capitalize on it.   Tiwana (2002) cites XEROX as an example of an innovative nonexploiter citing their PARC innovation as the foundation of the computer industry that XEROX did not take advantage of.   

===What is “intellectual capital”? Give some examples.===

Intellectual capital is intangible or “vague” assets that may not be measurable, but are invaluable to an organization (Tiwana, 2002).  In a business setting intellectual capital can be a companies competitive edge over other companies.  Examples of intellectual capital could be reputation, human knowledge, patents, strong leadership, or name recognition. In general if something adds value to a company, but it cannot be logged in the accounting ledgers that it is most likely intellectual capital.

===What skills do instructional technologists bring to knowledge management projects?===

Instructional technologists bring various skills to knowledge management projects. Included in these skills are identifying subject matter experts, designing instruction to enhance the knowledge base of an organization, determine appropriate methods to cross-train employees to share (verses hoard) knowledge, using the design process to transfer tacit knowledge to written or implicit knowledge.  Using models (ADDIE) to develop systematic method methods to use an organizations knowledge base to enhance an organization. Enhance the learning environment of an organization by defining learning characteristics and styles of the human resources in the organization.

===What problems are there with knowledge?===

Cost of obtaining knowledge or keeping knowledge from getting out can be very costly.  For instance to hire or train an employee with knowledge on how to fix O-rings on the space shuttle can have a very high price tag. 

In terms of interpretation knowledge can be interpreted differently, and the interpretation can have serious implications.  For example knowledge of weapons of mass destructions in Iraq were interpreted as a threat to civilization by the Bush administration.  This lead to serious consequences that are currently being debated by the public at all levels.

Hoarding poses a problem because knowledge can be hoarded.  Hoarding in itself is not a good thing.  Some persons hoard knowledge for financial gain.  Some persons hoard knowledge to be devious. An example of hoarding knowledge may be a person keeping knowledge from a judge or jury to sway the outcome of a court case.

Culture/language can also be a problem with knowledge.  This can also be linked to translation.  Translating knowledge can be very difficult and costly. For example translating knowledge written on the ancient pyramids in Egypt was a costly and time-consuming process.             
 

===What are the potential risks associated with not integrating KM into an organization’s operation?===

KM helps avoid unnecessary work duplication, expensive reinvestment, and repeated mistakes (Tiwana, 2002).

KM can save an organization from “knowledge walkouts” (2002). Meaning that persons with specific knowledge that is important for on organizations survival can leave without sharing that knowledge with others.  

KM can make an organization a proactive anticipator (2002).  Thus by implementing KM an organization can anticipate changes and use knowledge to anticipate change that without KM can hit an organization hard.

KM mutually reinforces an organization agility or dexterity (2002).  An organizations ability to react comes from their knowledge and the agility comes from the ability to apply the knowledge (2002). 


===Where would a KM professional argue that knowledge resides?===

Tiwana (2002) suggests that knowledge “originates in individual minds, but is often embedded in organizational routines, processes, practices, systems, software, and norms.” Behaviorism, which is a traditional educational conception, defines learning as a relatively permanent change in behavior that may or may not be the result of instruction (Morrison, Ross, &amp; Kemp 2004). Thus in terms of a traditional educational conception of learning, one could suggest that there is not a tension between KM professional concept of knowledge and an educational concept.  That is, KM professional agree that knowledge resides in an individuals mind and is passed along within the organization through routines or processes.  A behaviorist believes that learning is a change in behavior.  Thus for changes in the routine or process to occur learning as to occur, that is a change in behavior will result in the change of routines or process.  Therefore, both the KM professional and the behaviorist believe that learning and knowledge begin with an individual and are passed along through changes in behavior and the organization, respectively.

{{book title|Warfare | A study of battle from the dawn of time to today.}}

==War Throughout History==
From failure to success and somewhere in-between, this section views war from the perspective of reality rather than theory.

''&quot;History is written by the winners.&quot;''

''&quot;History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.&quot;'' -Attributed to Winston Churchill

''&quot;Those who will not remember history, are condemned to repeat it.&quot;'' -Santayanna.

''&quot;Walk softly, but carry a big stick.&quot;'' -Theodore Roosevelt.

It is hoped by many that one day we will have peace and unity throughout the world. Until that day arrives, people who are free or wishing to be free must be prepared to fight to maintain or obtain their freedom. Freedom is a temporary result of successful Warfare (and lots of politicking... but that's another book). Successful Warfare begins in the mind. To that end, the following section attempts to establish a mental framework in which the necessity of Successful Warfare is understandable.

A people may choose to avoid offensive actions. If they care to survive, they cannot avoid preparation for defensive actions. In the past invasions aimed to wipe out the original inhabitants.

After an early history of militancy, the Roman peoples became addicted to the opulence (or at least the free bread and circuses) that their empire had gained for them. Wearying of fighting their own wars, they attempted to defend their borders with hired help. Where is the Roman Empire today?

Iceland was sparsely inhabited by Irish monks before and when the Norse arrived. Iceland today has one of the most homogeneous (Scandinavian) gene-pools of any nation on earth. 

The Tibetans were one of China's scourges for centuries, descending from the Tibetan plateau to raid and pillage the Chinese. The Chinese solved the problem by sending in Buddhist monks espousing the peaceful philosophy of the Buddha. The Tibetans converted en masse. Who's laughing now?

''Freedom is not free.''

''If you can read this, thank a Teacher. If you can read this in English, thank a Veteran.'' -[anonymous Americana]

==Evolution of War==
This section details the evolution of warfare and fighting throughout the history of man.

'''Display vs. Proof.'''

Fighting requires resources. Expenditure of these resources produces a weakened state, more susceptible to losing the next confrontation. '''Displays''' and '''Intimidation''' have always been and will always be preferable to actual fighting. This is seen from the lowest orders of animals to the May-Day Parades of the Soviets (and at all stations in between). This is an unalterable axiom of warfare.

Display ''rather than'' Proof, however, allows for bluffing and deception.

'''Safety in numbers: more is better (usually).'''

In the beginning, there was the Alpha-male. The Alpha-male is, by definition, capable of defeating each an every other individual in &quot;the group&quot; in one-on-one fighting. 

Somewhat later, although still in the mists of time, it was discovered that two or more weaker individuals could combine their strengths to overcome an onerous alpha-male. It is also true, however, that allies ''usually'' fall to bickering among themselves once the obvious danger of the (former) Alpha-male has been removed. &quot;There can be only one&quot; is a truism of most primitive situations, and is the basis of the Executive branch of government in modern representative democracies (committees are a perfect way to prevent anything from actually being accomplished). Nonetheless, the concepts and utility of '''combined forces''' and '''collective security''' have been with us ever since. Bigger armies defeat smaller armies with alarming regularity. With a few hiccups (induced by the occasional downfall of society and subsequent dark ages), societal groupings (tribes/states) and their fighting branches (warrior-bands/armies) have tended to increase in size.

'''Speed vs. Armour'''

Basic fighting may be defined as delivering kinetic energy to ones adversary in ways least conducive to their continued functioning, while attempting to avoid their reciprocal offerings. 

The two primary ways of avoiding the receipt of kinetic energy are '''Speed''' (being fast enough to get out of the way) and '''Armour''' (shielding, to absorb the blow via the law of Conservation of Momentum). The requirements for Speed vs. Armour are mutually conflicting. The more armour you carry, the slower you can move... the faster you move, the less armour you can carry.

In the evolution of warfare, the pendulum has swung back and forth many times between the requirements for speed vs. armour. Usually it is some tactical or technical innovation which provides the impetus for reversing the swing. 

Greek Hoplites in phalanx formations were very heavily armoured for their day, yet they were undone by the administrative superiority of more lightly armoured Roman Legions. 

The introduction of the stirrup to Europe in the 5th century AD allowed what had been lightly armoured cavalry lancers to develop into the Knights in Armour of the mediaeval era. The extra stability of stirrups and larger horses allowing, for a time, high speed ''and'' heavy armour; the entire ensemble of man, horse, armour and arms being the delivery device for the kinetic energy. The high infrastructure requirements for supporting this fighting  style eventually helped to develop one of the highest levels of armouring seen: stone castles -- absolutely zero speed and manoeuvrability, combined with as much shielding as one could quarry, all in an attempt to defend the specific piece of land which allowed sustaining the fighting horses and men.

These circumstances, however, were wholly undone by the introduction of gun-powder and firearms beginning in the 14th century AD. Firearms induced a reversion to little or no armour. The available armouring technologies were incapable of  stopping bullets; and with the slow rate of fire and high rate of misfires, once a soldier had fired his shot, speed was of the utmost importance to complete ones bayonet charge before the enemy could reload.

Automatic weapons and machine guns reversed the pendulum yet again. Speed for charging meant little before the heavy sustained fire of the 20th century. Helmets, so noticeably absent from 18th and 19th century battlefields made a great comeback. It was the extreme heavy armour of tanks that broke the trench-warfare stalemate of WWI.

War planes, and fighter planes, rockets, and missiles... speed, speed, and more speed.

Nuclear weapons, however brought the state of the art back to ever larger bunkers, perhaps culminating in artifacts such as Cheyenne Mountain.

'''Guerilla Warfare'''

Guerrilla Warfare is a redundant misnomer, as &quot;Guerilla&quot; is Spanish for &quot;little war&quot;. But we seem to be stuck with the term in English, at least.

Guerilla Warfare takes maximum advantage of speed, and seems to have little use for armour. Furthermore, it would seem to defy the rule of &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot;, as most operations are conducted by small highly-mobile groups. During a guerilla attack, soldiers attack the enemy quickly, then &quot;vanish&quot; into the landscape.

To be maximally effective, however, an insurgency must be well entrenched, which is to say, they should have the support of the populous among which they operate. Thus, although they may have very few actual operatives, the collusion of the local ''non-combatants'' swells the effective number of real participants far beyond the number of soldiers their adversary may be able to field. Furthermore, the surrounding populous provides maximum opportunity for '''Cover and Concealment''' both before and after any particular strike.

'''Total War'''

Total War is the practice of considering all of an enemy's resources as valid targets; to include civilian population, and means of production (agricultural and industrial). 

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, there were no industrial means of production, aside from perhaps mining, smelting, and the activities of smiths (armourers). Agricultural means of production (farms and farmers) were more often siezed to augment the invader's supplies than destroyed, or rather destroyed by their defender to deny them to the invader (Scorched Earth Policy). Civilian populations, however, have always suffered during war, whether because they were taken to be sold into slavery, because their food was taken or destroyed, because their homes were occupied or destroyed, or due to the pestilence which always accompanies warfare.

During the high middle-ages in Europe, the code of Chivalry supposedly forbade the mistreatment of non-combatants. It is not at all clear that the civilians would agree that this was actually the case.

And for an all too brief period around the 18th century, War was considered a Gentlemen's' Sport: supposedly not making more of a mess than could be cleaned up by tea-time. This is more likely a Victorian romanticisation, all the more plausible the further you were in time and space from the battle field.

WWI and to a greater degree WWII were text-book examples of Total War; with indiscriminate use of Chemical Weapons and bombing (conventional and nuclear) of industrial/population centres to destroy enemy resources and morale.

'''Law of War'''

In conjunction with the increased use of Total War, the '''Geneva Conventions''' have been an attempt by the larger players in geo-politics to provide a framework for minimizing the inherent suffering of war. In particular, guidelines have been laid down concerning the &quot;fair&quot; treatment of medical facilities and personnel, clergy/chaplains, the wounded, and prisoners of war. 

The International Red Cross (and sister organizations such as the Red Crescent, et al.) are the bodies responsible for implementing many of the humanitarian assistances prescribed under the various Geneva Conventions.

The International Court at The Hague is the responsible body for trying and prosecuting parties suspected of breaching the guidelines laid out in the Geneva Conventions. [vide War Crimes and War Criminals]

Various treaties have been attempted to eliminate or reduce the threat from Chemical, Biological, and Nuclear weapons of mass destruction. None of these have been nearly as comprehensive as the Geneva Conventions. The United States, for instance, reserves the right of 1st strike with Nuclear Weapons, the right to retaliate with Chemical Weapons (2nd strike), and will not use Biological Weapons (no strike). 

It is extremely important to note, that the Geneva Conventions and these other treaties are all agreements between the governments of states/nations. Supranational terrorist groups are NOT parties to these agreements, and indeed, their most basic tactics fly in the very face of these agreements. It is left as an exercise for the reader as to whether or not these individuals should be accorded the rights guaranteed under these agreements.

'''Religious and Ideological Wars'''

Aside from merely wishing to conquer another group, and take what is theirs, Religious and Ideological Wars have been an attempt by one party to violently control the way another group thinks, or to subjugate or at least harm them because of what they think.

A non-exhaustive list of examples of this behaviour include the spread of Islam (7th century onward -- the creation of the Caliphate), various civil wars of the Byzantine Empire, the Crusades (12th through 14th centuries), the Wars of the Reformation, the spread and containment of Communism (the Cold War)(20th century), and the more recent disagreement between Islamic fundamentalist terrorists and the Western Nations.

==Levels of Military Thinking==

===Strategy===

If you're only thinking about military matters, you're not thinking about strategy. Strategy encompasses all the tools at a nation's disposal: military, diplomatic, economic and social. Military force is but one tool in a nation's toolbox.

Strategy is defining a nation's needs and objectives, and then devising a plan for meeting those needs and objectives. For example, in WWII Hitler knew he could not sustain Germany's military/industrial expansion without access to oil. Germany had no oil reserves and neither did any of its immediate neighbours. The closest oil reserves of any size were in the Caucasus mountains of Russia. So to meet Germany's need for oil, Hitler's strategy was to invade Russia and take theirs.

The actual invasion plan was not a strategic decision, but an operational one. At the military operational level, you are concerned primarily, if not solely, with military matters. So the decision to invade Russia was a strategic decision, but the decision of when and where to attack, and with what forces, were all operational decisions. Typically, strategic decisions are made by a country's political leaders while operational decisions are made by its senior military commanders.

=== Tactics ===

If you can smell the smoke and hear the gunfire, you're in a tactical situation. Tactical engagements are often called &quot;battles.&quot; The battles of The Alamo and Little Big Horn are famous examples of tactical battles. While strategic situations may take months, years or even decades to play out, tactical situations are usually resolved in a few minutes to a few days. In land combat, tactical decisions are made at the lower levels of the command structure, from junior officers down to individual soldiers. In naval combat, they are typically made by junior to senior level officers commanding anything from a single ship to a large carrier group. In air combat, tactical decisions are made by squadron leaders, who are typically mid-level officers, to individual pilots. Tactical decisions must typically be made quickly, under fire, and with immediate life-and-death consequences.

Decisions can however, be both a tactically good decision, but a strategically bad decision. This is how tactics and strategy are usually differentiated. For example, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor destroyed far more American military resources that Japanese military resources. This was a tactical victory by the Japanese, but the overall grand strategy was a failure because the events following Pearl Harbor resulted in Japan's defeat.

===Operations===

Between the political abstractions that characterize strategy and the minute-to-minute, life-and-death drama that characterizes tactics, lies the realm of operations. Operations tend to be strictly military affairs and are orchestrated by senior military commanders, generals and admirals. Operations tend to be unfold over days, weeks or even months and to involve large numbers of men and several battles. The Invasion of Normandy and the Tet Offensive are famous examples of recent military operations. The distinctions between these levels are fuzzy. For example, in the Battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War, there were actually a number of smaller tactical engagements, making the overall Battle of Gettysburg look more like an operational engagement than a tactical one.

==Military Branches and What They Do==

===The Army===

The primary job of the army is to take and control territory and to stop the enemy from doing the same. Modern armies are composed of basically 3 groups. First is the infantry, composed of individual soldiers fighting &quot;up close and personal&quot; with personal, hand-held weapons. This is the dirtiest, most dangerous, and most important job in the military. In the beginning was the infantry, and the infantry is still considered &quot;The Queen of the Battlefield.&quot; You can bomb the enemy's capital into a smoking rubble, but until your guys are walking around in its streets and cleared out any survivors, you can't claim to have conquered it.

Then there is the artillery, composed of big guns, or more recently, rockets. The guys firing the big guns rarely see their targets. They rely on forward observers to tell them where to shoot. An observer can be a guy on a hilltop, a guy in an airplane or anywhere they can see the target. This is called &quot;indirect fire.&quot; If the guys firing the guns can see their targets it is called &quot;direct fire.&quot; Artillery guys hate direct fire because it means the enemy is way too close. Half of all combat casualties are caused by artillery, so locating and destroying the enemy's artillery is always a high priority.

Finally, there is armour or tanks. Tanks specialize in moving quickly across relatively open ground and delivering a lot of fire-power. While tanks look big and imposing, they do have their vulnerabilities. Their main one is that they can't see very well. So tanks depend on infantry to be their eyes. A tank without infantry cover is very vulnerable. The Marines like to say that &quot;Hunting tanks is fun and easy.&quot; Tanks need room to move to be at their most effective, so they are of limited usefulness in heavy jungle or forest (like Vietnam), mountains (like Korea and much of Afghanistan), or in built-up cities (like Stalingrad). But in flat, open areas, like the deserts of Iraq and the steppes of Russia, they are fearsome indeed.

===The Navy===

Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans. The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods. One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain. At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic. Had the Allies failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.

In addition to this basic role, modern navies have developed other capabilities as well. An example is putting nuclear missiles into a submarine to turn it into a mobile, almost undetectable missile base. Submarines have also distinguished themselves as superb platforms from which to spy on the enemy. The recent best-seller ''Blind Man's Bluff'' is a gripping account of how this was done during the Cold War. The American navy has invested a lot to develop the ability to conduct amphibious assaults, that is, to attack from the sea using land-based forces (think D-Day). This is the primary mission of the U.S. Marines. Aircraft carriers also provide the navy with a mobile airfield which can be used to conduct air operations virtually anywhere in the world.

===The Air Force===

The introduction of aircraft in the early 20th Century adds a new dimension to warfare. That dimension reflects itself not only in new ways to deploy fire but also in boosting the ability of the ground troops to deploy their fire, supplying knowlegde about quantity, quality and disposition of opposing forces. Air power has a negative effect on the enemy's morale as well.

Since the introduction of balloons to spy on the enemy and to direct artillery barrages the importance of the aircraft rose exponentially: 
#balloons and reconaissance fixed-wing aircraft: spying, spotting
#air-superiority fighters: air-to-air fighting, gaining control of the air-space
#tactical bombers: targeting foes in the battlefield - JU-87 Stuka
#strategic bombers: destroying the enemy's ability to wage war - Allied campaign against the Axis
#rocket-proppeled unmanned one-use weapons - V1 and V2
#rotary-wing aircraft: both as gunships or transports
#multi-purpose unmanned aircraft: both as gunships or as reconnaissance

It's now impossible to disassociate ground and air power: the regular infantry or even small, commando-like units can call upon superior firepower in the form of airstrikes; small, highly mobile, unmanned aircraft can acquire information about enemy forces or infrastructure to direct ground operations. It's the exploration of all dimensions that deliver victory.

==Logistics==

Logistics is essentially distribution and delivery of supplies to troops. Supplies include anything from food rations, to additional soldiers, to munitions, to fuel and anything in between. As armies of an invading force moves out of it's home territory, supply lines are formed to deliver such supplies to soldiers fighting towards the front. Without supplies, soldiers will go hungry, vehicles will run out of fuel, guns will run out of ammunition, and armies will be unable to replace men lost in combat.

The concept of logistics has become increasingly important throughout the history of warfare. The more advanced military technology is, the more supplies necessary to continue a war effectively. For example, soldiers fighting with swords required far fewer and complicated supplies than soldiers fighting with gunpowder muskets. Today modern soldiers fighting with assault rifles with tanks and armored personnel carriers require a large variety of complicated supplies including ammunition, fuel, repair kits, additional weapons, etc.

Logistics is also part of strategy. During World War II the Chinese forces used a strategy where they purposely let the Japanese forces take land, while buying the Chinese forces time. Eventually the Japanese advance was halted as Japan simply could not find the supplies to reach further into China, while trying to fight an insurgency in the territory Japan occupied at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Debugging is the art of diagnosing errors in programs and determining how to correct them. &quot;Bugs&quot; come in a variety of forms, including: coding errors, design errors, complex interactions, poor user interface designs, and system failures.  Learning how to debug a program effectively, then, requires that you learn how to identify which sort of problem you're looking at, and apply the appropriate techniques to eliminate the problem.

Bugs are found throughout the software life cycle.  The programmer may find an issue, a software tester might identify a problem, or an end user might report an unexpected result.  Part of debugging effectively involves using the appropriate techniques to get necessary information from the different sources of problem reports.

The most common types of mistakes when programming are:
* Programming without thinking
* Writing code in an unstructured manner

== Bugs in Detail ==

What are these different kinds of bugs, then?

With coding errors, the source of the problem lies with programmer induced erroneous or improper code.  Some examples of coding errors include:
* Disregarding adopted conventions.
* Calling the wrong function (&quot;moveUp&quot;, instead of &quot;moveDown&quot;)
* Using the wrong variable names in the wrong places ( &quot;moveTo(y, x)&quot; instead of &quot;moveTo(x, y)&quot;)
* Failing to initialize a variable ( &quot;y = x + 1&quot;, where x has not been set) when absolutely required.
* Skipping a check for an error return.

Software users readily see some design errors, while in other cases design flaws make a program more difficult to improve or fix, and those flaws are not obvious to a user.  Obvious design flaws are often demonstrated by programs that run up against the limits of a computer, such as available memory, available disk space, available processor speed, and overwhelming input/output devices.  More difficult design errors fall into several categories:
* Failure to hide complexity
* Incomplete or ambiguous &quot;contracts&quot;
* Undocumented side effects

Complex interactivity bugs arise in scenarios where multiple parts of a single program, multiple programs, or multiple computers interact.

Poor user interface designs often lead users to use the program in ways that accomplish something other than what they intend.  For example, a &quot;search&quot; page for a web site might have an option for &quot;case-insensitive&quot; searching.  When the option is hard for the user to find or see, that user might report a bug that some of their data is &quot;lost&quot;, simply because it is not found by the case sensitive search.

Sometimes, computer hardware simply fails, and it usually does so in wildly unexpected ways.  Determining that the problem lies not with the software itself, but with the computer(s) on which it is usually complicated by the fact that the person debugging the software may not have access to the hardware that shows the problem.

== Preventing Bugs ==

No discussion of debugging software would be complete without a discussion of how to prevent bugs in the first place.  No matter how well you write code, if you write the wrong code, it won't help anyone.  If you create the right code, but users cannot work the user interface, you might as well have not written the code.  In short, a good debugger should keep an open mind about where the problem might lie.

Although it is outside the scope of this discussion to describe the myriad techniques for avoiding bugs, many of the techniques here are equally useful after the fact, when you have a bug and need to uncover it and fix it.  Thus, a brief discussion follows.

=== Understand the Problem ===

In order to write effective software, the developer must solve the problem the user needs solved.  Users, naturally enough, do not think in strict algorithms, windowing systems, web pages, or command line interfaces.  Rather, users think of their problems in the way that they think of their problems (yes, that is circular).

Sit down with the intended user, and ask them what they want from the software.  Users frequently want more than software can actually deliver, or have contradictory aims, such as software that does more, but doesn't require that they learn anything new.  In short, ask the users what their goals are.  Absent those goals, users will keep reporting bugs that do not add up to a coherent whole.

=== Effective Processes ===

=== Development Tools ===

=== Unit Testing ===
Unit testing means checking what happens in all possible states that the current module can enter. Therefore you should prepare a &quot;test list&quot; where you define all the possible inputs for current module. 
&lt;br /&gt;
For example: We have program that gets positive numbers from the user and process them. First we need to check if the input is a number (it can be a char), then we will check if it's positive. By checking I mean enter input and see what happens. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Hint: When you start to write this test list you'll notice that it's quite hard to predict all the possibilities; if you the option to ask someone else (that didn't help writing the module) to help it could be fruitful.

=== Documenting Code ===

== Basic debugging steps ==
Although each debugging experience is unique, certain general principles can be applied in debugging.  This section particularly addresses debugging software, although many of these principles can also be applied to debugging hardware.

The basic steps in debugging are:

* Recognize that a bug exists
* Isolate the source of the bug
* Identify the cause of the bug
* Determine a fix for the bug
* Apply the fix and test it

===Recognize a bug exists===
Detection of bugs can be done proactively or passively.

An experienced programmer often knows where errors are more likely to occur,
based on the complexity of sections of the program as well as possible data corruption.
For example, any data obtained from a user should be treated suspiciously.  Great care should be taken to verify that the format and content of the data are correct. Data obtained from transmissions should be checked to make sure the entire message (data) was received.
Complex data that must be parsed and/or processed may contain unexpected combinations of values that were not anticipated, and not handled correctly.
By inserting checks for likely error symptoms, the program can detect when data has been corrupted or not handled correctly.

If an error is severe enough to cause the program to terminate abnormally, the existence of a bug becomes obvious.
If the program detects a less serious problem, the bug can be recognized, provided error and/or log messages are monitored.
However, if the error is minor and only causes the wrong results, it becomes much more difficult to detect that a bug exists; this is especially true if it is difficult or impossible to verify the results of the program.

The goal of this step is to identify the symptoms of the bug.  Observing the symptoms of the problem, under what conditions the problem is detected, and what work-arounds, if any, have been found, will greatly help the remaining steps to debugging the problem.

===Isolate source of bug===
This step is often the most difficult (and therefore rewarding) step in debugging.
The idea is to identify what portion of the system is causing the error.
Unfortunately, the source of the problem isn't always the same as the source of the symptoms.
For example, if an input record is corrupted, an error may not occur until the program is processing a different record, or performing some action based on the erroneous information, which could happen long after the record was read.

This step often involves iterative testing.  The programmer might first verify that the input is correct, next if it was read correctly, processed correctly, etc.  For modular systems, this step can be a little easier by checking the validity of data passed across interfaces between different modules.  If the input was correct, but the output was not, then the source of the error is within the module.  By iteratively testing inputs and outputs, the debugger can identify within a few lines of code where the error is occurring.

Skilled debuggers are often able to hypothesize where the problem might be (based on analogies to previous similar situations), and test the inputs and outputs of the suspected areas of the program.  This form of debugging is an instance of the [[wikipedia:scientific method|scientific method]].  Less skilled debuggers often step sequentially through the program, looking for a place where the behavior of the program is different from that expected.  Note that this is still a form of scientific method as the programmer must decide what variables to examine when looking for unusual behavior.   Another approach is to use a &quot;[[wikipedia:binary search|binary search]]&quot; type of isolation process.  By testing sections near the middle of the data / processing flow, the programmer can determine if the error happens during earlier or later sections of the program.  If no data problems are detected, then the error is probably later in the process.

===Identify cause of bug===
Having found the location of the bug, the next step is to determine the actual cause of the bug, which might involve other sections of the program.  For example, if it has been determined that the program faults because a field is wrong, the next step is to identify why the field is wrong.  This is the actual source of the bug, although some would argue that the inability of a program to handle bad data can be considered a bug as well.

A good understanding of the system is vital to successfully identifying the source of the bug.  A trained debugger can isolate where a problem originates, but only someone familiar with the system can accurately identify the actual cause behind the error.  In some cases it might be external to the system: the input data was incorrect.  In other cases it might be due to a logic error, where correct data was handled incorrectly.  Other possibilities include unexpected values, where the initial assumptions were that a given field can  have only &quot;n&quot; values, when in fact, it can have more, as well as unexpected combinations of values in different fields (field x was only supposed to have that value when field y was something different). Another possibility is incorrect reference data, such as a lookup table containing incorrect values relative to the record that was corrupted.

Having determined the cause of the bug, it is a good idea to examine similar sections of the code to see if the same mistake is repeated elsewhere.  If the error was clearly a typo, this is less likely, but if the original programmer misunderstood the initial design and/or requirements, the same or similar mistakes could have been made elsewhere.

===Determine fix for bug===
Having identified the source of the problem, the next task is to determine how the problem can be fixed.  An intimate knowledge of the existing system is essential for all but the simplest of problems.  This is because the fix will modify the existing behavior of the system, which may produce unexpected results.  Furthermore, fixing an existing bug can often either create additional bugs, or expose other bugs that were already present in the program, but never exposed because of the original bug.  These problems are often caused by the program executing a previously untested branch of code, or under previously untested conditions.

In some cases, a fix is simple and obvious.  This is especially true for logic errors where the original design was implemented incorrectly.  On the other hand, if the problem uncovers a major design flaw that permeates a large portion of the system, then the fix might range from difficult to impossible, requiring a [[wikipedia:Rewrite (programming)|total rewrite]] of the application.

In some cases, it might be desirable to implement a &quot;quick fix&quot;, followed  by a more permanent fix.  This decision is often made by considering the severity, visibility, frequency, and side effects of the problem, as well as the nature of the fix, and product schedules (e.g., are there more pressing problems?).

===Fix and test===
After the fix has been applied, it is important to test the system and determine that the fix handles the former problem correctly.  Testing should be done for two purposes: (1) does the fix now handle the original problem correctly, and (2) make sure the fix hasn't created any undesirable side effects.

For large systems, it is a good idea to have [[wikipedia:Software testing|regression tests]], a series of test runs that exercise the system.  After significant changes and/or bug fixes, these  tests can be repeated at any time to verify that the system still executes as expected.  As new features are added, additional tests can be included in the test suite.

==Steps to reduce debugging==
There are concrete steps that can be taken to reduce the amount of time spent debugging software.  These are listed in the sections below.

===The correct mindset===
Probably the most important thing you can do when you are starting to debug a program is to realize that you don't understand what is going on.  Programmers who are convinced that their program should work fine are less likely to find errors simply because they are refusing to admit their confusion.  If the program behaved the way you think it does, you wouldn't be debugging; the program would be working fine.  Even when the program appears to work, if you examine it with the thought that there is at least one bug remaining and you are going to find it, then you are more likely to find something wrong with the program.

===Start at the source===
The time when you are most aware of where problems are more likely to arise is usually when first designing and writing the code.  By inserting integrity checks at various places within the program, problems can be detected and reported by the program itself.  In addition to detecting problems, considerations should be given as to how best to handle each error.  Options include:
*Report error, set invalid fields to a default value, and continue
*Report error, discard the record associated with the invalid value, and continue
*Report error, transfer invalid record into separate file/table so the user can examine and possibly correct the problem
*Report error and terminate the program

===Treat user input with suspicion===
Any data that originated from users (including external systems) should be treated with suspicion.  Carefully validate all such input data, performing syntactical and semantical integrity checks.  Such invalid data are a common source of programming errors.  Think not just of data entered in error, but malicious data as well, as in [[wikipedia:buffer overflow|buffer overflow]] exploits.

If data are entered interactively by users, you can provide appropriate [[wikipedia:error message|error message]]s and allow the user to correct the invalid field(s).  If data are not from an interactive source, then the erroneous records should be handled as described above.

===Use of log files===
Programs that write information to log files can provide significant information that can be used to analyze what was going on before, during, and after problems are encountered.  The number of entries to be searched can be reduced by creating various log files, such as a separate log for each major component of the system, plus one log file strictly for errors.  Each entry should be date/time stamped so that entries from different logs can be correlated.

===Test suites===
A standard set of tests that can be run to perform [[wikipedia:Regression testing|tests]] can assist in finding errors before they make it into production.  These test cases should be automated as much as possible to reduce the amount of effort required to perform these tests.  As new features are added to the system, additional tests should be created to exercise those features.

===Change one thing at a time===
When making a lot of changes, apply them incrementally.  Add one change, and then test that change thoroughly before starting on the next change.  This will reduce the number of possible sources of new bugs.  If several different changes are applied at the same time, then it is much more difficult to identify the source of the problem.  Furthermore, minor errors in different areas can interact to produce errors that never would have happened if those changes had been applied one at a time.

===Back out changes that have no effect===
If you make a change to fix a problem, but the program still behaves the same, back out those changes before proceeding.  The fact that your changes didn't do anything indicates one of several things:
*The problem is not where you think it is
*The area you modified either isn't being called, or isn't being called the way you think it is
*Assuming the section you changed wasn't executed, you might have introduced new bugs that won't appear until you fix the current bug

===Try another port of your Application===
Programs, that are available under different Architectures (e.g. Operation Systems like MS Windows, MacOSX, Linux or
Processors like Intel Pentium, PowerPC or DEC Alpha) sometimes react differently on other Systems (especially for subsequent errors). Sometimes it is far more easy to find the error on a different architecture.

===Think of similar situations===
When a bug has been found, think of other places where the same mistake might have been made.  Check those places and see if the same problem exists there as well.

== Finding User Interface Bugs ==

== Finding Design Bugs ==

== Finding Coding Errors ==

Not every kind of program is debugged in the same way and not all techniques can be used on all types of programs. 

The main character in debugging is the debugger. This is software which runs simultaneous with the newly written program and allows you to pause the program and read memory addresses, stack and various other normally invisible parts of your program. 

Another methode of debugging is the log-file. Outputting the contents of certain variables can provide valuable information on how your program performs. Outputting a string containing the name of the function when the function is called can be useful in locating when an error is introduced. For finding where a program crashes it's more practecle to use the debugger.

Large programs are hard to debug, small programs are (relatively) easy to debug. So the key is to turn a large program into a lot of small programs for debugging. This is called &quot;Unit testing&quot; and involves compiling a part of your program (a routine, a collection of related routines, a module or even a complete subsystem) with extra code to allow it to run without the rest of the code in place. 

Full screen application (especially games) can be hard to debug as you won't be able to see the debuggers output. A solution lays in using a null-modem cable, a second computer and a terminal program (e.g. Hyperterminal). Pipe the output of the debugger through the null modem cable to the second computer.

 e.g. In Dos with gdb using a serial null modem cable:
 
 Configure the port with mode: mode COM2: 9600,n,8,1,none
 Pipe the output to COM2 by adding &gt;COM2 when you invoke the debugger.

===BlitImage255===
Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'PutImage',imageArray,[rect],[copyMode])

Copy &quot;imageArray&quot; to a window, slowly. &quot;imageArray&quot; may be double or uint8. Its
values, which should be non-negative integers, are copied to the window, by
CopyBits or CopyBitsQuickly. &quot;imageArray&quot; can be an MxN array (for any window)
or MxNx3 array (only if the window pixelSize is 16 or 32 bits). In the latter
case the three r g b components are combined, as appropriate for the window
pixelSize, to form a single value that is copied to the window. In 16-bit mode
r, g, and b each contribute 5 bits. In 32-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 8
bits.

&quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to &quot;rect&quot;, scaling if
necessary. The rect default is the imageArray's rect, centered in the window.
The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of MATLAB's
numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper
left, and the rows are horizontal. Unless you specify a &quot;Quickly&quot; copyMode,
PutImage inherits the behavior of CopyBits, scaling the image into the rect.

The copyMode argument is a string variable that is passed to the VideoToolbox
CopyWindows routine. copyMode can be 'srcCopy' (default) or 'bltFast'. 

The copying is done in two stages. First, slowly, from the image array into a
temporary offscreen window, and then, quickly, from there to the window
designated by &quot;windowPtr&quot;.
 
===BringMATLABToFront===

Usage:

SCREEN('MATLABToFront',[n])

Bring forward n-th window in MATLAB Window menu.  If not specified, n defaults
to 0 (the command window).
 
===BringWindowToFront===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowToFront')

Bring specified window to front.
 
===ClearScreen===
Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillRect',[color],[rect])

Fill &quot;rect&quot;. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this
window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire screen, so you can use this
function to clear the screen.
 
===Close===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'Close')

Close any of SCREEN's windows (on- or offscreen). Closing an on-screen window
takes about a second. After closing the last on-screen window the cursor is made
visible.
 
===CloseAll===

Usage:

SCREEN('CloseAll')

Close all of SCREEN's windows (on- and offscreen). Closing each on-screen window
takes about a second. After closing the last on-screen window the cursor is made
visible.
 
===CloseScreen===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'Close')

Close any of SCREEN's windows (on- or offscreen). Closing an on-screen window
takes about a second. After closing the last on-screen window the cursor is made
visible.
 

===Computer===

Usage:

desribeStruct=SCREEN('Computer')

Return information about the computer in a Matlab struct.
 
===CopyWindow===

Usage:

SCREEN('CopyWindow',srcWindowPtr,dstWindowPtr,[srcRect],[dstRect],[copyMode])

Copy images, very quickly, between two windows (on- or off- screen). copyMode
can be only 'srcCopy' on Win.  (default, will scale image to fit in dstRect).
Use with Rush for reliable timing. See Rush. 
 
===CopyWindows===

Usage:

SCREEN('CopyWindow',srcWindowPtr,dstWindowPtr,[srcRect],[dstRect],[copyMode])

Copy images, very quickly, between two windows (on- or off- screen). copyMode
can be only 'srcCopy' on Win.  (default, will scale image to fit in dstRect).
Use with Rush for reliable timing. See Rush. 
 

===DrawLine===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'DrawLine',[color],fromH,fromV,toH,toV,[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw a line. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel. Default is black. Default &quot;penWidth&quot; and &quot;penHeight&quot;
is 1. &quot;penMode&quot; specifies the drawing mode: The Win32 GDI interface does not
have support for these Copy, Or, xOr operatation. So the pen modes here
represent the line styles of the pen: 'patCopy' (solid pen, default), 'patOr'
(dashed), 'patXor' (dashdot), 'patBic' (dotted), 'notPatCopy' (invisible),
'notPatOr' (dashed), 'notPatXor' (dashdotdot), 'notPatBic' (inside frame).

===DrawOval===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillOval',[color],[rect])

Fills an ellipse with the given color, inscribed within &quot;rect&quot;.&quot;color&quot; is the
clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel;
default produces white with the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize.
Default rect is whole window.
 
===DrawPoly===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillPoly',[color],pointList)

Fill polygon. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you
want to poke into each pixel; default produces white with the standard CLUT for
this window's pixelSize. &quot;pointList&quot; is a matrix: each row specifies the (x,y)
coordinates of a vertex.
 
===DrawRect===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillRect',[color],[rect])

Fill &quot;rect&quot;. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this
window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire screen, so you can use this
function to clear the screen.
 
===DrawText===

Usage:

[newX,newY] = SCREEN(windowPtr,'DrawText',text,[x],[y],[color])

Draw text. &quot;text&quot; may include two-byte characters (e.g. Chinese). Default &quot;x&quot;
&quot;y&quot; is current pen location. &quot;color&quot; is the CLUT index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with the
standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. &quot;newX,newY&quot; return the final pen
location. 
 
===FillArc===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillArc',[color],[rect],startAngle,arcAngle)

Draw a filled arc inscribed within the rect. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar
or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces
black with the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is
entire window. Angles are measured clockwise from vertical.
 
===FillOval===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillOval',[color],[rect])

Fills an ellipse with the given color, inscribed within &quot;rect&quot;.&quot;color&quot; is the
clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel;
default produces white with the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize.
Default rect is whole window.
 
===FillPoly===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillPoly',[color],pointList)

Fill polygon. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you
want to poke into each pixel; default produces white with the standard CLUT for
this window's pixelSize. &quot;pointList&quot; is a matrix: each row specifies the (x,y)
coordinates of a vertex.
 
===FillRect===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillRect',[color],[rect])

Fill &quot;rect&quot;. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this
window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire screen, so you can use this
function to clear the screen.
 
===FrameArc===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FrameArc',[color],[rect],startAngle,arcAngle,[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw an arc inscribed within the rect. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g
b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with
the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire window.
Default pen size is 1,1 .Angles are measured in degrees, clockwise from vertical.

===FrameOval===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FrameOval',[color],[rect],[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw the outline of an oval.  &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with the
standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire window.
Default pen size is 1,1. 
 
===FrameRate===

Usage:

hz=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'FrameRate',[hz])

Frame rate, in Hz, as most recently measured for this screen (typically when you
first opened it). 

MacOS:
FrameRate counts frames over some measured period and calculates the rate.
Setting &quot;hz&quot; doesn't affect the screen, only the returned value. Setting &quot;hz&quot; to
NaN or [] forces SCREEN to remeasure it now, eg after you use a Control Panel to
change the screen resolution. The cached value is flushed when you close the
last window on this screen. 

Windows:
The returned value is the nominal frame rate, not the measured rate. The
returned value is always current.  FrameRate will accept an argument, for
compatibility with the MacOS implementation, but it ignores the value passed.
 
===FrameRect===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FrameRect',[color],[rect],[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw the outline of a rectangle. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with the
standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire window.
Default pen size is 1,1. &quot;penMode&quot; specifies the drawing mode: The Win32 GDI
interface does not have support for these Copy, Or, xOr operatation. So these
pen modes here reprensent the line styles of the pen: 'patCopy' (solid pen,
default), 'patOr' (dashed), 'patXor' (dashdot), 'patBic' (dotted), 'notPatCopy'
(invisible), 'notPatOr' (dashed), 'notPatXor' (dashdotdot), 'notPatBic' (inside
frame). 
 
===Gamma===

Usage:

[oldGammaTable,dacSize]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Gamma',[gammaTable],[dacSize])

Get/set the gamma table. The gamma table will usually be 256x1 or 256x3. Most
users won't need this function. 
 
===GetClut===

Usage:

clut=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'GetClut',[bits])

Get the color lookup table (CLUT) of a video screen. The returned &quot;clut&quot; is a
3-column matrix with one row per RGB entry in the hardware CLUT. The &quot;clut&quot;
values will be in the range 0 to 255 for an 8-bit CLUT.
 

 
===GetFrontWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN('GetFrontWindow')

Get window pointer for frontmost window.

===GetImage===

Usage:

imageArray=SCREEN(windowPtr,'GetImage',[rect])

Slowly copy an image from a window, returning a MATLAB uint8 array. If the
window's pixelSize&gt;8 then the returned imageArray has three layers, an RGB
image. &quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates, and its default is the whole window.
CHANGE: as of April, 1998, imageArray is now uint8 instead of double to save
space (a factor of 8). However, MATLAB will issue an error if you try to do math
on a uint8 array, so you may need to use DOUBLE to convert it, e.g.
imageArray/255 will produce an error, but double(imageArray)/255 is ok. Also see
'PutImage' and 'CopyWindow'.
 
===GetImage255===

Usage:

imageArray=SCREEN(windowPtr,'GetImage',[rect])

Slowly copy an image from a window, returning a MATLAB uint8 array. If the
window's pixelSize&gt;8 then the returned imageArray has three layers, an RGB
image. &quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates, and its default is the whole window.

imageArray/255 will produce an error, but double(imageArray)/255 is ok. Also see
'PutImage' and 'CopyWindow'.
 
===GetMATLABWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN('GetMATLABWindow',[n])

Get window pointer for n-th in MATLAB's Window menu.
 
===GetWindowByTitle===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN('GetWindowByTitle',title);

Get window pointer for window with specified title.
 
===GlobalRect===
SCREENGlobalRect not supported yet. 
 
===IsOffscreen===

Usage:

isOffscreen=SCREEN(windowPtr,'IsOffscreen')

Find out whether window is offscreen.  Responses: 1=yes; 0=no
 
===MATLABToFront===

Usage:

SCREEN('MATLABToFront',[n])

Bring forward n-th window in MATLAB Window menu.  If not specified, n defaults
to 0 (the command window).
 
===MoveWindow===
SCREENMoveWindow is not supported yet. 
 
===OpenOffscreenWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'OpenOffscreenWindow',[color],[rect],[pixelSize]);

Open an offscreen window (offscreen surface in DirectDraw). This is simply an
area in memory that is treated as a window. Offscreen windows are very useful
for creating images for subsequent display, because copying between windows is
very fast. You may specify a screen (a screenNumber&gt;=0) or no screen
(screenNumber=-1). If you do designate a screen then the offscreen window is
attached to the DirectDraw object associated with that screen. You may specify
no screen (screenNumber=-1), but any real screen must already have an open
SCREEN window when you call OpenOffscreenWindow. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index
(scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default is
white. &quot;rect&quot; specifies the size of the offscreen window and what part of the
screen the offscreen window is aligned with. If supplied, &quot;rect&quot; must contain at
least one pixel. If a screenNumber is supplied then &quot;rect&quot; is in screen
coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the size of that screen. If
a screenNumber of -1 is supplied then &quot;rect&quot; defaults to the size of the main
screen. (In all cases, subsequent references to this new offscreen window will
use its coordinates: origin at its upper left.) &quot;pixelSize&quot; sets the depth (in
bits) of each pixel. If you specify a screen (screenNumber&gt;=0) and a pixelSize&gt;0
then they must be consistent. If you specify no screen (screenNumber=-1) then
the default pixelSize is the same as the main screen, but you can specify any
legal depth: 8, 16, 24, 32. A pixelSize of 0 or [] is replaced by the default.
 
===OpenWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'OpenWindow',[color],[rect],[pixelSize]);

Open an onscreen window. Specify a screen by a windowPtr or a screenNumber (0 is
the main screen, with menu bar). &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default is white. If supplied,
&quot;rect&quot; must contain at least one pixel. If a windowPtr is supplied then &quot;rect&quot;
is in the window's coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole
window. If a screenNumber is supplied then &quot;rect&quot; is in screen coordinates
(origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole screen. (In all cases,
subsequent references to this new window will use its coordinates: origin at its
upper left.) The Windows version accepts &quot;rect&quot; but disregards it, the window is
always the size of the display on which it appears. &quot;pixelSize&quot; sets the depth
(in bits) of each pixel; default is to leave depth unchanged. Opening or closing
a window takes about a second. 
 
===PixelSize===

Usage:

[oldPixelSize,oldIsColor,pages]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'PixelSize',[pixelSize],[isColor])

Get/set screen depth, gray/color mode, and number of video pages. (We don't yet
provide a way of changing the page.)
 
===PixelSizes===

Usage:

pixelSizes=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'PixelSizes')

List all possible pixelSizes for this screen.The Windows Version returns only
pixel sizes available at the current display size.
 
===Preference===

Usage:

boolean=SCREEN('Preference','Backgrounding')
oldBoolean=SCREEN('Preference','IgnoreCase',[boolean])
psychTableVersion=SCREEN('Preference','PsychTableVersion')
mexFunctionName=SCREEN('Preference','PsychTableCreator')
oldPriority=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt',priority)
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt',[boolean])
bits=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','ClutDacSize')
boolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','FixedClut')
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking',[boolean])
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutQuickly',[boolean])
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutCallsWaitBlanking',[boolean])
oldFrames=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutSimulatesBlankingInterrupts',[frames])

Get/set various preferences. The first four are general, the rest are related to
WaitBlanking or SetClut and are screen-specific. &quot;boolean&quot; values are 1
(nonzero) for Yes and 0 for No. Preferences are volatile: They're set by SCREEN
when you first use each screen, and they're flushed by closing the last SCREEN
window (e.g. by 'Close', 'CloseAll', or flushing SCREEN.mex by typing &quot;clear
screen&quot;). So do any preference setting after calling 'OpenWindow'. WARNING:
These settings allow you to access all the internal parameters that determine
SCREEN's behavior. As a result the set of parameters is ever-changing, as SCREEN
evolves to deal with an ever-changing environment (e.g. video drivers that don't
wait for blanking, and Rush's high priority). Feel free to play with these
expert controls, but, if you do, realize that you may have to tweak your
'Preference' calls with each new release of the PsychToolbox.

- SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking reports whether the monitor's video driver waits
for blanking. Usually read-only, you can also set/clear this on the PowerMac
7300/7500/7600/8500/8600 built-in driver.
- SetClutQuickly specifies your preference for whether to use a custom
SetEntriesQuickly.c driver (if available for this device) in place of the
standard video driver. The SetEntriesQuickly drivers don't wait for blanking.
- SetClutCallsWaitBlanking determines whether WaitBlanking should be called
after each call to SetClut.
- SetClutSimulatesBlankingInterrupts sets/gets the number of blanking interrupts
to simulate after each SetClut, to make up for interrupts missed during the
SetClut call.
- WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt specifies a preference for whether WaitBlanking
should use SetClut (original driver) or the screen's blanking interrupt to wait
for blanking. See 'WaitBlanking'.
- MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt specifies the maximum priority at which the
hardware blanking interrupt still works. Normally this is 1, but it's reduced to
0.5 (on non-PCI Macs) if necessary for timing the 3-ms interval during which
spurious VBL interrupts are ignored. Your programs can override this setting,
but your computer is likely to hang unless you really know what you're doing.

 
===PutColorImage===
PutColorImage is obsolete.  Use PutImage instead.
Please use SCREENPutImage.
 
===PutImage===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'PutImage',imageArray,[rect],[copyMode])

Copy &quot;imageArray&quot; to a window, slowly. &quot;imageArray&quot; may be double or uint8. Its
values, which should be non-negative integers, are copied to the window, by
CopyBits or CopyBitsQuickly. &quot;imageArray&quot; can be an MxN array (for any window)
or MxNx3 array (only if the window pixelSize is 16 or 32 bits). In the latter
case the three r g b components are combined, as appropriate for the window
pixelSize, to form a single value that is copied to the window. In 16-bit mode
r, g, and b each contribute 5 bits. In 32-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 8
bits.

&quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to &quot;rect&quot;, scaling if
necessary. The rect default is the imageArray's rect, centered in the window.
The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of MATLAB's
numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper
left, and the rows are horizontal. Unless you specify a &quot;Quickly&quot; copyMode,
PutImage inherits the behavior of CopyBits, scaling the image into the rect.

The copyMode argument is a string variable that is passed to the VideoToolbox
CopyWindows routine. copyMode can be 'srcCopy' (default) or 'bltFast'. 

The copying is done in two stages. First, slowly, from the image array into a
temporary offscreen window, and then, quickly, from there to the window
designated by &quot;windowPtr&quot;.
 
===Rect===

Usage:

rect=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Rect')

Get local rect of window or screen.
 
===Screens===

Usage:

screenNumbers=SCREEN('Screens')

Return an array of screenNumbers.
 
===SelectMATLAB===

Usage:

SCREEN('MATLABToFront',[n])

Bring forward n-th window in MATLAB Window menu.  If not specified, n defaults
to 0 (the command window).
 
===SetClut===

Usage:

err=SCREEN(windowPtr,'SetClut',clut,[startEntry],[bits])

Set the DirectDraw palette for the screen.

The palette is set immediately, without waiting for the vertical blanking.

The &quot;clut&quot; argument is a MATLAB matrix with 3 columns. The number of entries
written is the number of rows in &quot;clut&quot;. Each RGB entry in the hardware CLUT is
loaded with a row of &quot;clut&quot;. Each &quot;clut&quot; value should be in the range 0 to 255
for an 8-bit CLUT. Argument startEntry is optional and determines which CLUT
entry to load first (entries are numbered from 0 up), to load just a subset of
the CLUT's entries. 
We suggest that &quot;startEntry&quot; always be zero or greater. 

The &quot;bits&quot; argument specifies how many bits you want to write to the CLUT.
Typically it will be 8, which is the default value. If you set it to some other
value, the range of allowable entries scales accordingly. Thus if you use a
9-bit CLUT, then each entry should be between 0 and 511, etc. 

PREFERENCES:

===SetClutQ===

Usage:

err=SCREEN(windowPtr,'SetClut',clut,[startEntry],[bits])

Set the DirectDraw palette for the screen.

The palette is set immediately, without waiting for the vertical blanking.

The &quot;clut&quot; argument is a MATLAB matrix with 3 columns. The number of entries
written is the number of rows in &quot;clut&quot;. Each RGB entry in the hardware CLUT is
loaded with a row of &quot;clut&quot;. Each &quot;clut&quot; value should be in the range 0 to 255
for an 8-bit CLUT. Argument startEntry is optional and determines which CLUT
entry to load first (entries are numbered from 0 up), to load just a subset of
the CLUT's entries. 
We suggest that &quot;startEntry&quot; always be zero or greater. 

The &quot;bits&quot; argument specifies how many bits you want to write to the CLUT.
Typically it will be 8, which is the default value. If you set it to some other
value, the range of allowable entries scales accordingly. Thus if you use a
9-bit CLUT, then each entry should be between 0 and 511, etc. 

PREFERENCES:

===SetDrawingRegion===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'SetDrawingRegion',shapeSpec,[shapeFlag])

Make subsequent drawing to the window visible only if it is within the specified
region. This does not apply to PutImage or CopyWindow operations. 
Call with rect equal to screenRect to reestablish the entire screen.  Drawing
outside the region is suppressed, but still takes the normal amount of time to
complete.

If shapeFlag == 0 [default], shapeSpec is a rect, region is rectangular.
If shapeFlag == 1, shapeSpec is a rect, region is oval.
If shapeFlag == 2, shapeSpec is a point list, region is polygonal.

 
===SetGamma===

Usage:

[oldGammaTable,dacSize]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Gamma',[gammaTable],[dacSize])

Get/set the gamma table. The gamma table will usually be 256x1 or 256x3. Most
users won't need this function. 
 
===TextFace===

Usage:

oldStyle=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextStyle',[style])

Get/set the font style for future text draws in this window. Useful values for
style follow; they may be OR'd.

0=normal,1=bold,2=italic,4=underline. (Outline, Condense and Extend are not yet
supported on the Windows version)
 
===TextFont===

Usage:

[oldFontName,oldFontNumber]=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextFont',[fontNameOrNumber])

Get/set the font for future text draws in this window. You can ask what the
current font is, or specify the desired font by number or by name (e.g.
'Helvetica'). Font numbers may not be consistent from PC to PC.If no windowPtr
is given, and no fontName argument is supplied, then print out a list of all
font names. The default font (set by Windows) is 1 (the System font) for both
on-screen off-screen windows. 
 
===TextMode===

Usage:

oldCopyMode=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextMode',[copyMode])

Get/set text copy mode of this window.

copyMode can be an integer or a string: 'srcCopy' (default), 'srcOr', 'srcXor',
'srcBic', 'notSrcCopy', 'notSrcOr', 'notSrcXor', 'notSrcBic', 'patCopy',
'patOr', 'patXor', 'patBic', 'notPatCopy', 'notPatOr', 'notPatXor', 'notPatBic'.
On the Windows version, this function does nothing, since there is no apparent
options on Windows that correspond to the Mac text modes.
 
===TextSize===

Usage:

oldFontSize=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextSize',[fontSize])

Get/set the font size for future text draws in this window.
 
===TextStyle===

Usage:

oldStyle=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextStyle',[style])

Get/set the font style for future text draws in this window. Useful values for
style follow; they may be OR'd.

0=normal,1=bold,2=italic,4=underline. (Outline, Condense and Extend are not yet
supported on the Windows version)
 
===TextWidth===

Usage:

width=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextWidth',text);	% horizontal offset (negative for right-to-left scripts, e.g. Hebrew).

Get width of text string. Width is the change in horizontal pen position that
would be produced by calling DrawText; it's negative for right-to-left scripts
(e.g. Hebrew). The text may include 2-byte characters (e.g. Chinese).
 
===UsageWarnings===

Usage:

[oldMore,oldSeverity,oldAlready]=SCREEN('UsageWarnings',[more],[severity],[already])

Control how usage warnings are handled.

Severity=0(suppress),1(warn), 2(error)
 
===VideoCard===

Usage:

[cardName,driverName,driverVersion,slotName]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'VideoCard')

Get information about video hardware.
 
===WaitBlanking===

Usage:

framesSinceLastWait=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WaitBlanking',[waitFrames])

Wait specified number of blankings (frame endings). Call with waitFrames==1 (or
omit it, since that's the default) to wait for the beginning of the next frame.
Video cards mark the end of each video frame by briefly reducing the voltage to
the Vertical Blanking Level (VBL), which &quot;blanks&quot; the screen to black. We do all
video timing relative to the beginning of blanking. You may want to run
'WaitBlanking' at high priority (see Rush and Priority) for reliable timing. To
keep this routine as fast as possible, no value is returned unless you supply an
argument to receive it. When processor priority is at or below
MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt the WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt 'Preference'
controls, for each screen, whether 'WaitBlanking' calls SetClut (default) or
waits for a blanking interrupt. When processor priority is above
MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt, 'WaitBlanking' always uses SetClut (i.e.
cscSetEntries or cscDirectSetEntries call to video driver).
 
===WaitVBL===

Usage:

framesSinceLastWait=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WaitBlanking',[waitFrames])

Wait specified number of blankings (frame endings). Call with waitFrames==1 (or
omit it, since that's the default) to wait for the beginning of the next frame.
Video cards mark the end of each video frame by briefly reducing the voltage to
the Vertical Blanking Level (VBL), which &quot;blanks&quot; the screen to black. We do all
video timing relative to the beginning of blanking. You may want to run
'WaitBlanking' at high priority (see Rush and Priority) for reliable timing. To
keep this routine as fast as possible, no value is returned unless you supply an
argument to receive it. When processor priority is at or below
MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt the WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt 'Preference'
controls, for each screen, whether 'WaitBlanking' calls SetClut (default) or
waits for a blanking interrupt. When processor priority is above
MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt, 'WaitBlanking' always uses SetClut (i.e.
cscSetEntries or cscDirectSetEntries call to video driver).
 
===WindowKind===

Usage:

kind=SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowKind')

What kind of windowPtr is this? Returns 0 if it's invalid, -1 our offscreen, 1
our onscreen, 2 MATLAB's onscreen.
 
===Windows===

Usage:

windowPtrs=SCREEN('Windows')

Return an array of windowPtrs.
 
===WindowScreenNumber===

Usage:

screenNumber=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WindowScreenNumber')

Get the screen number.
 
===WindowTitle===

Usage:

title=SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowTitle')

Get window's title
 
===WindowToBack===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowToBack')

Send specified window to back
 
===WindowToFront===

Usage:

Ada is very well suited for all kind of calculations. You can define you own fixed point and floating point types and &amp;mdash; with the aid of generic packages call all the mathematical functions you need. In that respect Ada is on par with [[Programming:Fortran|Fortran]]. This module will show you how to use them and while we progress we create a simple [[wikipedia:Reverse Polish notation|RPN]] calculator.

== Simple calculations ==

=== [[Wikipedia:Addition|Addition]] ===

Additions can be done using the predefined operator {{Ada/operator|+}}. The operator is predefined for all numeric types and the following, working code, demonstrates its use:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|numeric_1.adb}}

    F_IO.Put (Value_2);
    T_IO.Put (&quot; = &quot;);
    F_IO.Put (Value_1 {{Ada/operator|+}} Value_2);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Numeric_1;

=== [[Wikipedia:Subtraction|Subtraction]] ===

Subtractions can be done using the predefined operator {{Ada/operator|-}}. The following extended demo shows the use of + and - operator together:

         Result := Value_1 + Value_2;
      {{Ada/kw|when}} '-' =&gt;
         Result := Value_1 - Value_2;
      {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt;
         T_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Illegal Operation.&quot;);
         {{Ada/kw|goto}} Exit_Numeric_2;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
 
   F_IO.Put (Value_1);

 {{Ada/dl|&lt;&lt;}}Exit_Numeric_2{{Ada/dl|&gt;&gt;}}
   {{Ada/kw|return}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Numeric_2;

Purists might be surprised about the use of goto &amp;mdash; but some people prefer the use of goto over the use of multiple return statements if inside functions &amp;mdash; given that, the opinions on this topic vary strongly. See the [[Ada Programming/Control#Isn.27t_goto_evil.3F|isn't goto evil]] article.

=== [[Wikipedia:Multiplication|Multiplication]] ===

Multiplication can be done using the predefined operator {{Ada/operator|*}}. For a demo see the next chapter about Division.

=== [[Wikipedia:Division (mathematics)|Division]] ===

Divisions can be done using the predefined operators {{Ada/operator|/}}, {{Ada/operator|mod}}, {{Ada/operator|rem}}. The operator {{Ada/operator|/}} performs a normal division, {{Ada/operator|mod}} returns a modulus division and {{Ada/operator|rem}} returns the remainder of the modulus division.

The following extended demo shows the use of the {{Ada/operator|+}}, {{Ada/operator|-}}, {{Ada/operator|*}} and {{Ada/operator|/}} operators together as well as the use of a four number wide stack to store intermediate results:

The operators {{Ada/operator|mod}} and {{Ada/operator|rem}} are not part of the demonstration as they are only defined for integer types.

== [[Wikipedia:Exponentiation|Exponential]] calculations ==

All exponential functions are defined inside the generic package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}}.

=== [[Wikipedia:Exponentiation|Power of]] ===

Calculation of the form &lt;math&gt;x^y&lt;/math&gt; are performed by the  operator {{Ada/operator|**}}. Beware: There are two versions of this operator. The predefined operator {{Ada/operator|**}} allows only for Standard.Integer to be used as exponent. If you need to use a floating point type as exponent you need to use the {{Ada/operator|**}} defined in {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}}.

=== [[Wikipedia:Root (mathematics)|Root]] ===

The square root &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{x} &lt;/math&gt; is calculated with the function &lt;code&gt;Sqrt()&lt;/code&gt;. There is no function defined to calculate an arbitrary root &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt;. However you can use logarithms to calculate an arbitrary root using the mathematical identity: &lt;math&gt; \sqrt[b]{a} = e^{\log_e (a) / b} &lt;/math&gt; which will become &lt;code&gt;root := Exp (Log (a) / b)&lt;code&gt; in Ada. Alternatively, use &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[b]{a}=a^{\frac1b}&lt;/math&gt; which, in Ada, is &lt;code&gt;root := a**(1.0/b)&lt;/code&gt;.

=== [[Wikipedia:Logarithm|Logarithm]] ===

{{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}} defines a function for both the arbitrary logarithm &lt;math&gt;log_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the natural logarithm &lt;math&gt;log_e(x)&lt;/math&gt;, both of which have the same name &lt;code&gt;Log()&lt;/code&gt; distinguished by the number of parameters.

=== Demonstration ===

The following extended demo shows the how to use the exponential functions  in Ada. The new demo also uses [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Strings.Unbounded|Unbounded_String]] instead of Strings which make the comparisons easier.

Please note that from now on we won't copy the full sources any more. Do follow the download links to see the full program.

=== [[Wikipedia:Complex number|Complex]] arithmethic ===

For [[Algebra/Complex Numbers|complex arithmetic]] Ada provides the package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Types}}. This package is part of the &quot;special need Annexes&quot; which means it is optional. The open source Ada compiler GNAT implements all &quot;special need Annexes&quot; and therefore has complex arithmetic available.

Since Ada supports user defined operators, all &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/operator|+}}, {{Ada/operator|-}}, {{Ada/operator|*}})&lt;/small&gt; operators have their usual meaning as soon as the package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Types}} has been instantiated &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/kw|package}} ... {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} ...)&lt;/small&gt; and the type has been made visible &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|type}} ...)&lt;/small&gt;

Ada also provides the packages {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Complex_IO}} and {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Elementary_Functions}} which provide similar functionality to their normal counterparts. But there are some differences:

* {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Elementary_Functions}} supports only the exponential and trigonometric functions which make sense in complex arithmetic.

* {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Complex_IO}} is a child package of {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} and therefore needs its own {{Ada/kw|with}}. Note: the &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Complex_IO}}Get ()&lt;code&gt; function is pretty fault tolerant - if you forget the &quot;,&quot; or the &quot;()&quot; pair it will still parse the input correctly.

So, with only a very few modifications you can convert your &quot;normals&quot; calculator to a calculator for complex arithmetic:

=== [[Linear Algebra/Vectors in Space|Vector]] and [[Linear_Algebra/Describing_the_Solution_Set#matrix|Matrix]] Arithmetic ===

Ada supports [[Linear Algebra/Vectors in Space|vector]] and [[Linear_Algebra/Describing_the_Solution_Set#matrix|matrix]] Arithmetic for both normal real types and complex types. For those, the generic packages Ada.Numerics.Generic_Real_Arrays and Ada.Numerics.Generic_Complex_Arrays are used. Both packages offer the usual set of operations, however there is no I/O package and understandably, no package for elementary functions.

Since there is no I/O package for vector and matrix I/O creating a demo is by far more complex &amp;mdash; and hence not ready yet. You can have a look at the current progress which will be a universal calculator merging all feature.

Status: Stalled - for a Vector and Matrix stack we need Indefinite_Vectors &amp;mdash; which are currently not part of GNAT/Pro. Well I could use the booch components ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the United States, [[w:Genealogy|genealogy]] is a major and growing hobby, aided in large part by the increasing availability of both free and subscription on-line information resources.  This chapter contains information on some of these on-line resources as a beginning to a more thorough treatment of the pecularities of pursuing genealogy research in the United States.  The point of view taken here is largely that of an individual looking into his or her own history.

==Immigration==
The vast majority of Americans are descendents of immigrants within the past 400 years.  One of the points of interest for most researchers is &quot;when did my family arrive in the United States?&quot;  This invariably has multiple answers as a result of mingling blood lines immigrant groups or distinct waves of immigrants.  There are basically two parts to this question: &quot;where was the entry point?&quot; and &quot;when was the entry time?&quot;  In many cases a researcher has one of these two pieces of information, often as an anecdote passed down orally through the family.

===Major entry points===
====New York and Ellis Island====
One of the most significant entry points in the United States in terms of the sheer volume of persons passing through it was [[w:Ellis Island|Ellis Island, New York]].  Millions of immigrants entered the country through this point during its years of operation from 1892 to 1924.  In 1982, [[w:Lee Iacocca|Lee Iacocca]], at the behest of [[w:Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan]], headed the formation of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation (SOLEIF).  In 2001, an activity of this foundation led to the establishment of the American Family Immigration History Center, which has made available on-line 25,000,000 immigrant arrival records for public access.  The website for the Foundation, which prominently features a search interface for this set of records, is located at http://www.ellisisland.org/.

== metric symbols ==

The '''liter''' is abbreviated as [[Cookbook:L|L]].
The '''milliliter''' is abbreviated as [[Cookbook:mL|mL]].

There is no metric unit designated by a lowercase l. This would be confused with the number 1 and uppercase letter I.

== Pie Crust ==

[[Cookbook:Lemon_Meringue_Pie]] and [[Cookbook:Banana_Cream_Pie]] have very similar crusts. Since the crust is useful by itself, and duplication leads to inconsistency, I was thinking I'd move the crust instructions to a new [[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust]] page. I hope you don't mind.

Problem is, the recipes are already inconsistent. I don't know if this is intentional or not. The banana one wants &quot;1 egg, whipped&quot; (the white included?), while the lemon one wants &quot;1 egg yolk&quot; (not whipped?). Even if this is intentional, it would be nice to move the more-normal of the two (the banana one?) to a page by itself.

BTW, if you think I'd be responsible and useful as an admin, please support [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#AlbertCahalan|my adminship request]]. I have well over 1500 wiki edits, which has been enough to earn me a few enemies it seems. (sorry I'm not perfect; I've probably made a few dreadful edits but I have shown responsibility elsewhere, including as a Tux Paint and procps developer)

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:43, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

::In the crust recipe the egg white is really optional. When making the Lemon Meringue Pie, I use the egg white in the Meringue, where it is more useful. When making the Banana Cream Pie, I just use the whole egg in the crust. This pie crust recipe, using vinegar, results in a consistently good flaky crust. Other pie crust recipes I've tried, turn out in a tough crust. Probably because this recipe tolerates handeling more than others. I will vote for you. [[User:Reubenbarton|Reubenbarton]] 19:17, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It's interesting that the crust uses 100% shortening. Very old pie crust recipies use lard, which is supposedly the best. Shortening was developed as a lard substitute. Shortening keeps longer and has less saturated fat, but it does have ''trans-'' fats which are now thought to be worse than saturated fats. It seems that modern pie crust recipes are moving towards the use of butter, which seems very wrong to me. Butter does not have the same melting properties and it contains almost 20% non-fat content. Butter even has more saturated fat than lard, so it isn't the choice to make for health. Since lard is the most healthful of the choices and seems like a perfect drop-in alternative to shortening, it might deserve a mention. Perhaps you could try it. I just bought a tub of lard to replace my shortening, but I'm not exactly a pie expert, and the hot weather here would probably make for a bad pie crust no matter what recipe I use. Do you use a chilled surface, chilled roller, or strong air conditioning? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:09, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I have used lard in pie crusts and biscuits. Lard makes a more flaky crust. It also makes a far superior biscuit. Lard gives the crust a different flavor than shortening. Shortening doesn't really have a flavor, but lard does. Lard can also impart a slight flavor to other things like cookies. I guess my aversion to using lard is because of being told for so many years that lard and animal fat are &quot;bad&quot; for you. It seems that every other year some health study comes out pointing in a different direction. But I do use lard on occasion. The other points you make are also true. Shortening is easier to store and use. I live in Sacramento, California. In the summer, temperatures here reach 100-degrees F. for days on end. My house is air conditioned. I also chill the shortening. For me, cooking is a hobby and my wife enjoys the break when she doesn't have to cook. [[User:Reubenbarton|Reubenbarton]] 01:47, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::Heh. Yeah, I know! It felt weird buying a tub of lard last week. Lard sure did get a bad reputation, but it seems to be the best of the well-known ''solid'' fats. You can't make a pie crust with olive oil... or can you? Compared to most liquid oils, '''all''' the solid fats are bad. People used to fry in lard, which certainly doesn't make sense when Canola oil works so well now. (never fry in olive oil; it will smoke) I'll guess that the major past abuse of lard was for frying french fries, for which there are many good alternatives. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:10, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::: According to [http://www.hormel.com/templates/knowledge/knowledge.asp?catitemid=42&amp;id=571], olive oil has a higher smoke point than canola. Go figure. Corn oil is the traditional choice for a frying oil (I belive most donuts these days are fried in corn). Donuts in particular used to be fried in coconut oil (or lard), which has a much higher level of saturated fat (like lard) but does not suffer from many of the problems of [partially-]hydrogenated oils or heated unsaturated fats (which are hydrogenated to some degree by being heated). From [http://www.fi.edu/brain/fats.htm#brainblockers]: &quot;... if French fries were cooked in saturated fat instead of in hydrogenated vegetable oils, they would probably be safer.&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 03:21, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::::: That's a very cheap solvent-extracted olive oil then. The smoke point of olive oil varies greatly. The [[Cookbook:Smoke_Point|numbers we have]] show olive oil at 200-406 ºF and Canola at 440 ºF. When people say that olive oil is especially good for you, they're referring to the greenish flavorful kind that smokes at only 200ºF.

==Code Snippets==

* Function that takes a list of desired keys and returns the number of the one that was pressed and is nearer to the front of the list that was passed. It ignores other keypresses.
&lt;pre&gt;
 function keyPressed = getKeys(keysWanted) % keysWanted is a matrix list of keys you are 
                                           % waiting for e.g, [124 125 kbName('space')]
  flushevents('keydown');
  success = 0;
  while success == 0
   pressed == 0;
   while pressed == 0
    [pressed, secs, kbData] = kbcheck;
   end;
    for i = 1:length(keysWanted)
      if kbData(keysWanted(i)) == 1
       success = 1;
       keyPressed = keysWanted(i);
       flushevents('keydown');
       break;
      end;
    end;
    flushevents('keydown');
   end;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   

* Wait for a key press, continue after two seconds
&lt;pre&gt;
  tEnd=GetSecs+2;
  while ~KbCheck &amp; GetSecs&lt;tEnd
    % Sleep one millisecond after each check, so we don't
    % overload the system in Rush or Priority &gt; 0
    WaitSecs(0.001);
  end
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Bring command window to front. Even though it won't come in front of a window opened by Screen, it is useful to include this, as it allows you to type e.g. Screen('Closeall') to close the window of a crashed program
&lt;pre&gt;
commandwindow;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Issue: KbCheck doesn't appear to wait for key presses, exits loop earlier then expected, continues to return key presses. Solution: make sure you first wait for any keys to be released. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
commandwindow;
touch=1;
while touch==1
    [touch, secs, keycode] = KbCheck;
    % Sleep one millisecond after each check, so we don't
    % overload the system in Rush or Priority &gt; 0
    WaitSecs(0.001);
end
touch = 0;
i=0;
while ~touch
 % Sleep one millisecond after each check, so we don't
 % overload the system in Rush or Priority &gt; 0
 WaitSecs(0.001);
 [touch, secs, keycode] = KbCheck;
 fprintf('.');
 if i==50
  fprintf('\n');
  i=0;
 end
 i=i+1;
end
clc; % clear command window, removing any typed characters
fprintf('\ntouch down\n\n');
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Everyone!  Bill Beaty here.  &quot;Static electricity is electricity which is static&quot; is a common misconception which has made its way into K6 textbooks.  In fact, &quot;Static&quot; electricity retains all of its characteristics even when it flows, therefore its unmoving-ness is not important in understanding it.  A better definition: ''Static electricity occurs whenever a piece of matter contains more protons than electrons, or when it contains more electrons than protons.''  Or this one:''When the positive and negative charges in matter are not equal, the matter has a charge imbalance.  We call this imbalance by the name Static Electricity.''  Remember that rubbing some fur against some rubber does not create any charges of electricity, instead it creates an ''imbalance'' of charges (the charges, the electrons and protons, were already there beforehand.)

This is a pastry shell pie filled with fresh sliced bananas in a vanilla pudding type base. A layer of whipped cream is added to the top.

==Ingredients==
===[[Cookbook:Pie Crust|Pie crust]]===
*[[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust|Grandma's Pie Crust]].

===Pie filling===
*1/2 cup white granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*6 tablespoons [[cookbook:Flour|all purpose flour]]
*1/4 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
*2 1/2 cups [[cookbook:milk|milk]]
*1 [[cookbook:egg|egg]], whipped
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
*4 ripe [[cookbook:banana|banana]]s, sliced
*1/4 cup [[cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]

===Pie topping===
*1/2 cup [[cookbook:Cream|heavy cream]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
*1 1/2 teaspoons [[cookbook:powdered sugar|powdered sugar]]

==Procedure==
===Pie crust===
#Prepare [[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust|Grandma's Pie Crust]].

===Pie filling===
#In the top of a [[cookbook:double boiler|double boiler]], [[cookbook:whisk|whisk]] together sugar, flour, salt and milk. Stir out any lumps.
#Bring water to [[cookbook:boiling|boiling]] in lower portion of double boiler.
#Stir constantly until mixture is thickened, about 5-minutes.
#Place lid on mixture and continue cooking for 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
#Beat egg in a small bowl. Add about 1/2 cup of hot pie filling mixture to egg in bowl and stir well. This tempers the egg so it won't scramble when added to the hot pie filling.
#Pour tempered egg mixture into pan of hot pie filling. Stir constantly and cook for 2 more minutes.
#Remove from heat, add butter and vanilla. Stir until mixed.
#Slice 2 bananas. Dip slices in lemon juice, shake off excess and distribute banana slices in the bottom of baked pie shell.
#Pour half of pie filling over bananas in bottom of pie shell. Make sure banana slices are covered by pie filling.
#Slice remaining 2 bananas. Dip in lemon juice, shake off excess and arrange on top of filling in pie.
#Pour remainder of pie filling over second layer of bananas in pie shell. Cover all bananas with filling.
#Chill for about 1 hour before adding topping.


===Pie topping===
#In a large bowl, whip cream with [[cookbook:electric mixer|electric mixer]] until peaks are just forming.
#Beat vanilla and sugar into cream and continue mixing until peaks form in cream.
#Don't over beat the mixture or it will form lumps and begin to turn to butter.
#Spread whipped cream mixture over pie filling on chilled pie. Keep chilled until served.

==Warnings==
The pie filling is quite hot when pouring it into pie shell. Keep this pie refrigerated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikicode vs. HTML tags ==

The [[Template:Ada/attribute]] template was fully written with wikicode (two quotes), but later it was changed to HTML tags because sometimes there where some visualisation problems: Those two quotes of the template when placed after the quote of the attribute of the code became boldface in wikicode. For that reason it where changed to &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tags, doing the same with the other two templates: [[Template:Adakw]], [[Template:Ada/operator]]. And although in principle there couldn't happen the same problem with those two, I think it's safer to stick to HTML tags. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 20:57, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Dann sollten wir auch Template:Ada/operator_2 anpassen ;-) --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:27, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: Sorry? Automatic translation, is it correct?: ''Then we should adapt also [[Template:Ada/operator 2]] ;-)''. I didn't know that this template existed. Added to [[Template:Ada]] and put HTML tags. Thanks for pointing it out! --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 08:23, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Ups. did not notice that I wrote german. We will also need a 2nd version for special - because both operator and special need to display characters which wiki won't like. I will do it as soon as there is time - rigth now my wife waits for me.--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:42, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

''For laptop users: You might have to turn on the &quot;Emulate Numpad&quot; option if you don't have a number pad on your laptop. This is found above the &quot;File,&quot; &quot;Add,&quot; &quot;Timeline,&quot; [etc.] pullout bar under &quot;System and OpenGL&quot; (also called the &quot;User Preferences&quot; bar later on).''

I've searched for this for a long time and havent found .... I don't have the &quot;System and OpenGL&quot; bar, only the &quot;User Preferences&quot; bar.
Where is this option ???? --[[User:Wladston|Wladston]] 13:24, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

Found it. Put your mouse cursor just under the bottom edge of the &quot;File&quot; menu bar, and drag down. A new panel will open. Dennis G. Jerz, 12 July 2006.

== More Syntax ==

Should we include syntax examples for things like menu paths? With so many different users people are constantently using different ways such as:

'''SPACE'''''&amp;rarr;Add&amp;rarr;Lamp''

'''SPACE''' &gt; Add &gt; lamp ''etc''...

and '''SPACE''' -&gt; ''Add'' -&gt; ''lamp''

So how should we display these paths?

Also some people use 'return' when we seem to have always used '''ENTER'''.. hmmm --[[User:Kisubo|Kisubo]] 01:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
----


Yes, i think we should. I like the first one with &amp;rarr;.

I also think there should be a global syntax for menu items and values and thelike. This would make them stick out of the text much better and thus the tutorial can be easier referred back to. Like when you've already finished the tutorial before but forgot about a certain function or something. Then it would be easier to find those remarks, if you don't have to read through it again.
Using italic letters with quotation marks would be a start (like &quot;''File''&quot; menu).

==Mac Users without multi-button mice==

&lt;strike&gt;So now there's a section for Mac single-button mice, but on my iMac, running Blender 2.41, I'm finding what's been written here to be inaccurate; did it change at some point?  For me, LMB is regular click, RMB is Apple+click, MMB is Option+click, and I'm fairly certain I haven't changed any of the defaults...&lt;/strike&gt;.

Ok, I looked a bit further, and saw text in the ''Blender Windowing System'' page that said part of this.  I duplicated it here, but am guessing that it probably shouldn't be in both places.

[[User:DavidJaquay|DavidJaquay]] 20:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)


== Key sequence ==
It would be fine to add some syntax about key sequence : how to write the '''CTRL''', '''SHIFT''', '''MKEY''' sequence ?

I think it should be : '''CTRL + SHIFT + MKEY''' ( some people write : '''CTRL-SHIFT-M''' ).
Others : '''ALT''', '''MKEY''' : '''ALT + MKEY''' ( some people write : '''ALT-M''' ).

== Reformated content ==
I've reformated content to use footnotes on this page, as well as imported in the ''Non-standard equipment'' from other chapters. The purpose:
* To eliminate redundancy, and better overall book content by centralizing niche stuff.
* To better equip those with non-standard equipment early on
I've also use the wikibook syntax, if someone likes those old orange tables, feel free to add a ''style-sheet'' for them. [[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] 17:00, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

== Mac Command key ==
On the newer Mac keyboard they have removed the Apple logo form the command key. Since the command key has had this weird character (&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#8984;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) on it for so long it might be easier to refer to it by the character itself.

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#8984;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''</text>

A service pack can be incremental, which means it only contains the updates that were not present in the previous service packs or, it can be cumulative, which means it includes the contents of all its predecessors. In the case of Microsoft's products, an incremental update was called a service release. For example, Office 2000 must be upgraded to '''service release''' 1 ('''SR'''-1) before one can install SP2.

== Macro Security ==
Macro security settings are located in the Trust Center. However, if you work in an organization, your system administrator might have changed the default settings to prevent anyone from changing any settings and execute macros.

==Macro Recording==
A great way of learning about Excel VBA is using its macro recording function. With the function, you tell Excel to start recording, then perform various steps as if you were working without a macro recorder, and finally, tell Excel to stop recording. VBA code corresponding to what you did using Excel GUI has been recorded by Excel. While the code often cannot be meaningfully used without a modification, by starting from it and modifying it you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent reading the VBA documentation.

== Making an XLA ==
* Works on: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329750/en-us|Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2], [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324126/en-us|Microsoft Excel 2000 SR-1]

An XLA is one way to make a VBA code-library. It's basically just a normal spreadsheet(.xls file) but has its worksheets hidden. Here's how to create a new one:
* New Workbook
* Save-As ...Name it whatever
* Hit Alt-F11
* In the Project-tree, select VBAProject(whatever.xls)/ThisWorkbook
* Hit F4 to get Properties View
* Find Property IsAddin and set to True
* Hit Save
* Close Excel
* Rename whatever.xls to whatever.xla

Alternatively, you can use Save As / Excel AddIn.

==Accessing the Registry==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

This recipe is for reading/writing keys local to your application -- this is to provide persistent settings for your VBA app. It does not cover arbitrary access to the Registry (i.e. looking at any key).

The VBA sub/functions are &lt;code&gt;SaveSetting&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetSetting&lt;/code&gt;. You can type the following into the Immediate window  to get a feel for how these work:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
SaveSetting &quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;, &quot;MyKeyName&quot;, &quot;Hello World&quot;
MsgBox GetSetting(&quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;, &quot;MyKeyName&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to iterate over all keys in a given section you can do so as follows:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Sub ShowAllKeys()
   Dim mySettings As Variant
   mySettings = GetAllSettings(&quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;)
   If Not IsEmpty(MySettings) Then
      Dim counter As Integer
      For counter = LBound(mySettings) To UBound(mySettings)
          Dim keyname As String: keyname = mySettings(counter, 0)
          Dim keyval As String: keyval = mySettings(counter, 1)
          MsgBox keyname &amp; &quot;=&quot; &amp; keyval
      Next
   End If
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also delete a registry key as follows:
 DeleteSetting &quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;, &quot;MyKeyName&quot;

FYI: Excel/VBA sticks this in the following registry location:
 MyComputer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\MyApplicationName\MyConfigSection
...where &lt;code&gt;MyApplication&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MyConfigSection&lt;/code&gt; are whatever you specified in your &lt;code&gt;SaveSettings&lt;/code&gt; call.

They end up in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\MyApplicationName\MyConfigSection.

==Prevent Confirmation Popups In Excel==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

Make the following call from VBA:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Application.DisplayAlerts = False
&lt;/source&gt;

==Making Cells Read-Only==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Sub ProtectMe()
  Range(&quot;A1:IV65536&quot;).Locked = False
  Range(&quot;A1&quot;).Locked = True
  ActiveSheet.Protect Password:=&quot;Test&quot;
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finding Non-Empty Portion of Worksheet==
A Worksheet has a maximum size of 65536 rows by 256 columns. However if you want to iterate over all cells you probably don't want to visit all of the empty ones. For this purpose the Worksheet provides the UsedRange property. For example:
 ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count
tells you how many non-empty rows are in the given worksheet. Empty rows which are inbetween the first and last used row are counted as well. Example: If a given Worksheet has entries in cells A7 and B16, used range is considered to be A7:B16, which counts for a total of 10 rows.

==Using Events==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

Consider the following class definition -- Assume its a class called CMyClass:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Option Explicit
Dim WithEvents mySheet As Worksheet

Public Sub Init(aWS as Worksheet)
   Set MySheet = aWS
End Sub

Private Sub mySheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
   Dim MyRange As Range
   For Each MyRange in Target
      Debug.Print CStr(MyRange)
   Next
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The main ideas here are:
* By declaring mySheet WithEvents, you're saying that CMyClass is listening to mySheet's events.
* By declaring the member sub mySheet_SelectionChange you're indicating how an instance of CMyClass should react if mySheet experiences a selection change (i.e. the user selects a new cell or range of cells);  The general pattern for events is sub memberVarName_EventName(params).
* You can disconnect the eventing between the given worksheet and CMyClass by setting mySheet = nothing;
* You can create classes that throw events of your design using:
** You would declare at the top of the class: Public Event SomeNiceEventName(YourFavoriteParam1 as WhateverType, etc...), 
** You could then raise that event (i.e. firing it to whatever listeners your class has) using RaiseEvent SomeNiceEvent(&quot;Some nice event happened.&quot;);
* VBA in Excel doesn't like the letters r or c used as variables. Those letters mean 'row' and 'column' elsewhere.

A little more detail is given here: [[http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/vbanut/chapter/booklet.html#sect12]]

==Caveat: Uncaught Exceptions ==
Caveat: Uncaught exceptions in event-handlers cause VBE to mysteriously reset. If you are causing an uncaught exception in an event-handler, you probably won't get an error popup. Instead, VBE will just reset. For this reason you should make sure you're catching exceptions in all of your event handlers.

==Caveat: Online-Help Typos ==
Some versions of Excel can have typos in the F1-help. Here's an example of a Click handler with the ''correct'' parameters:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
 Private Sub clicksrc_Click(ByVal Ctrl As Office.CommandBarButton, CancelDefault As Boolean)
    MsgBox &quot;I got a click!&quot;
 End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Iterating Over MultiSelected Cells==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

The following code-snippet writes &quot;YAY!&quot; in each cell selected by the user:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For Each Cell in Selection
   Cell.Value = &quot;YAY!&quot;
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exporting VBA Code ==
* Works on Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

The following code provides a very primitive routine to write serializes the VBA code in your modules to files:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Option Explicit
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)
  Dim objModule As Object
  On Error Resume Next
  
  For Each objModule In ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents
    DoEvents
    If objModule.CodeModule.CountOfLines &gt; 0 Then
      objModule.Export objModule.Name &amp; &quot;.bas&quot;
    End If
  Next objModule

End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Resize a Named Range==
*Excel 2003
 
Note that the ''Resize'' property of ''Range'' objects does ''not'' change the size of the range object.  It returns a new anonymous ''Range'' object.  Easiest way to do this is to set the .Name property of the Resized range:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub ResizeRange(ByVal RangeName As String, _
                Optional NewRowCount As Long = 0, _
                Optional NewColumnCount As Long = 0)
    
  Dim oRange As Range
  Set oRange = Range(RangeName)
  If NewRowCount = 0 Then
    NewRowCount = oRange.Rows.Count
  End If
  If NewColumnCount = 0 Then
    NewColumnCount = oRange.Columns.Count
  End If
  
  oRange.Resize(NewRowCount, NewColumnCount).Name = RangeName
  
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
==Creating a Named Range==
*Excel 2002

Named Ranges allow the user to refer to a cell or range of cells by name instead of by their cell address. This name can be used in other cell formulas as well as in VBA (e.g. using the &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;''SomeName''&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;). There are two sorts of named ranges: ''Workbook Names'' and ''Worksheet Names''. 

To create a ''Workbook Name'' you can select the cell you want to name, pull down ''Insert--&gt;Name--&gt;Define...''  This will bring up the &quot;Define Name&quot; dialog. Here you can enter the new name for your cell.

The create a ''Worksheet Name'' you follow the same procedure but precede the name with ''Sheetname''&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Sheet1!InitialValue&lt;/code&gt; to create a named-range only visible from within worksheet &lt;code&gt;Sheet1&lt;/code&gt;.

When there are two variables with the same name, one local (''Worksheet Name'') and one global (''Workbook Name''), the spreadsheet uses the local variable.

There is no way to ''visualize'' a named range. The closest thing is to pull down again ''Insert--&gt;Name--&gt;Define...'', but this method does not show if a variable is a local ''Worksheet Name'' or a global ''Workbook Name''.

The named range can be a single cell, part of a row, part of a column or a rectangular group of cells. Each one behaves differently:
* A single cell can be referenced anywhere in the worksheet or, if it's defined globally (''workbook name''), anywhere in any worksheet.
* A group of cells composing part of a row can only be referenced in a parallel row. For example, if the named variable is ''mass'' and it spans the cells C5:L5, then a reference to ''mass' at cell E8 (say, a formula like ''=mass * (3e8)^2'') would take the value at C8, but a reference to ''mass'' at cell M9 would return an error
* Similarly, a group of cells composing part of a column can only be referenced in a parallel column. Cells outside the range will return an error
* A group of cells that define a rectangular array of sides greater than one is only useful to be referenced in other worksheets - so, there's no point in defining them locally (''worksheet name''). For example, if ''covmatrix'' are the cells ''Sheet1!B2:D4'', then if cell ''Sheet2!C3'' has the formula ''=1/sqrt(covmatrix)'', then it will return ''1/sqrt(Sheet1!C3)''.

==Reading a File==
Reading a file line by line AKA for each line of a file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  MyFileName = &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\File.txt&quot;
  FileNo = FreeFile()
  Open MyFileName For Input As #FileNo
  While Not EOF(FileNo)
    Line Input #FileNo, MyLine
    MsgBox MyLine
  Wend
  Close #FileNo
&lt;/source&gt;

==Writing to a File==
Writing to a file:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
  MyFileName = &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\File.txt&quot;
  FileNo = FreeFile()
  Open MyFileName For Output As #FileNo
  For I = 1 To 10
    Print #FileNo, Str(I);
    ' The semicolon above prevents printing of a newline
  Next
  Close #FileNo
&lt;/source&gt;

Writing the tab-separated content of the current worksheet to a text file, disregarding some of cell content formatting such as percentages:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
  MyFileName = &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\File.txt&quot;
  FileNo = FreeFile()
  Open MyFileName For Output As #FileNo
  RowCount = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells.Rows.Count
  ColumnCount = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells.Columns.Count
  For RowNo = 1 To RowCount
    For ColNo = 1 To ColumnCount
      Print #FileNo, Cells(RowNo, ColNo); ' The semicolon bars newline printing
      If ColNo &lt; ColumnCount Then
        Print #FileNo, vbTab;
      End If
    Next
    If RowNo &lt; RowCount Then
      Print #FileNo, vbNewline;
    End If
  Next
  Close #FileNo
&lt;/source&gt;

==File Existence==

Testing whether a file exists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If Dir(MyFileName) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; Then
    MsgBox &quot;The file exists.&quot;
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Directories==
Making a directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  MkDir &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\TestFolder&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Removing a directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  RmDir &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\TestFolder&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Changing a directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ChDir &quot;C:\Users&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Changing the current drive:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ChDrive &quot;C:&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Listing the content of a directory, using a custom filter encompassing two file extensions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Directory = &quot;C:\Users\Joe Hoe\&quot;
Set Files = New Collection
Set FileFullPaths = New Collection
MyFile = Dir(Directory)
While MyFile &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
  Extension = LCase(Right(MyFile, 4))
  If Extension = &quot;.txt&quot; Or Extension = &quot;.bat&quot; Then
    Files.Add MyFile
    FileFullPaths.Add Directory &amp; MyFile
  End If
  MyFile = Dir() 'Next file or folder
Wend
&lt;/source&gt;

==Grep==
Searching for a regular expression in the lines of the files of a directory aka grepping:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Directory = &quot;C:\Users\Joe Hoe\&quot;
PatternString = &quot;target.*path&quot;
  
MyFile = Dir(Directory)
Set Lines = New Collection
Set RegExp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
RegExp.Pattern = PatternString
RegExp.IgnoreCase = True
While MyFile &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
  Extension = LCase(Right(MyFile, 4))
  If Extension = &quot;.txt&quot; Or Extension = &quot;.bat&quot; Then
    MyFullFileName = Directory &amp; MyFile
    FileNo = FreeFile()
    Open MyFullFileName For Input As #FileNo
    While Not EOF(FileNo)
      Line Input #FileNo, MyLine
      If RegExp.Test(MyLine) Then
        Lines.Add MyLine
      End If
    Wend
    Close #FileNo
  End If
  MyFile = Dir() 'Next file or folder
Wend
'Lines is a collection of the matching lines
&lt;/source&gt;

==Clipboard==
Prerequisites: Accessing the clipboard from an Excel sheet requires that a reference to MSForms (Microsoft Forms Object Library) is set in the sheet. You can set the reference by adding and subsequent removing of a user form, via Insert &gt; UserForm in a pop-up menu. To check the presence of a reference, see Tools &gt; References menu.

Placing text on the clipboard:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyClipboard = New MSForms.DataObject
MyClipboard.SetText &quot;My string&quot;
MyClipboard.PutInClipboard
&lt;/source&gt;

Getting text from the clipboard:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyClipboard = New MSForms.DataObject
MyClipboard.GetFromClipboard
TextContent = MyClipboard.GetText
&lt;/source&gt;

Links:
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.dataobject.aspx DataObject Class] at msdn.microsoft.com; contains a section on Visual Basic, whose applicability to Excel VBA is unclear

==Range==
A range is a set of cells. The cells in a range do not need to be adjacent. However, the cells in a single range do need to belong to a single worksheet.

Defining a new range:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Selection 'The current selection, possibly of multiple cells
Set MyRange = ActiveCell 'The single active cell
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 2) 'Row=1, Column=2 AKA B
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 1).Offset(0, 1) '=Cells(1, 2)
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 2).Offset(0, -1) '=Cells(1, 1)
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 1).Offset(0, -1) 'An error
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;A1:C2&quot;) 'Letters indicate columns; numbers indicate rows
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;A1:A3,C1:C3&quot;) 'A discontinuous range
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:C2&quot;).Cells(1, 1) '=Cells(2, 2) =Range(&quot;B2&quot;)
Set MyRange = Rows(1) 'An entire row
Set MyRange = Columns(1) 'An entire column
Set MyRange = Cells(2,2).EntireRow
Set MyRange = Cells(2,2).EntireColumn
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B1:C1&quot;).EntireColumn 'Two entire columns
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlUp) '=Cells(1, 2) =Range(&quot;B1&quot;)
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlToLeft) '=Cells(2, 1) = Range(&quot;A2&quot;)
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlDown) '=Cells(&lt;last row number&gt;, 2)
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlToRight) '=Cells(2, &lt;last column number&gt;)

&lt;/source&gt;

Iterating a range AKA for each cell in a range:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Selection
For Each Cell in MyRange
  MsgBox Cell
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Iterating rows and iterating columns AKA for each row of a range and for each column of a range, even if discontiguous:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set Rng = Range(&quot;A1:B1,D3:E3&quot;) 'Discontiguous range
For Each Row In Rng.Rows
  RowNo = Row.Row
Next
For Each Column In Rng.Columns
  ColNo = Column.Column
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Making an union (a range subsuming both) or intersection (a range covering only cells in common) of two ranges:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;A1:C2&quot;)
Set MyRange = Union(MyRange, Range(&quot;A5:C5&quot;))
MyRange.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 0)
Set MyRange = Intersect(MyRange, Columns(2))
MyRange.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 100, 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

Selecting a range:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Sheets(1).Range(&quot;A1:B1,D1:E1&quot;)
MyRange.Select 'Even a discontinuous range can be selected
&lt;/source&gt;

Activating a cell:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Range(&quot;A1:B2&quot;).Select 'Affects Selection, generally of multiple cells
Range(&quot;A2&quot;).Activate 'Affects ActiveCell, the single one
&lt;/source&gt;

Finding out about a range AKA learning about a range, including the number of cells AKA cell count, the first row, the last row, the first column, the last column, row count, and column count:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set Rng = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;) 'Contiguous range
NumberOfCells = Rng.Cells.Count
FirstRowNo = Rng.Row
LastRowNo = Rng.Row + Rng.Rows.Count - 1 'Only for contiguous ranges
FirstColNo = Rng.Column
LastColNo = Rng.Column + Rng.Columns.Count - 1 'Only for contiguous ranges

Set Rng = Range(&quot;A1:B1,D1:E1&quot;) 'Discontiguous range
BrokenLastColNo = Rng.Column + Rng.Columns.Count - 1 'Only for contiguous ranges
'Do it the correct way for discontiguous range
LastColNo = 0
For Each Cell in Rng
  If Cell.Column &gt; LastColNo then
    LastColNo = Cell.Column
  End If
Next

Set RangeWorksheet = Rng.Worksheet
&lt;/source&gt;

==Worksheet==
To create, access, or delete worksheets, you can use the  methods of Worksheet objects. Examples follow.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyNewWorksheet = Sheets.Add 'Create
Set MyNewWorksheet2 = Sheets.Add(After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)) 'Create and place as the last sheet
MyNewWorksheet.Name = &quot;My Sheet&quot;
Set IndexedWorksheet = Sheets(1) 'Access by index
Set NamedWorksheet = Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;) 'Access by name
Set NamedWorksheet2 = Worksheets(&quot;Name&quot;) 'Does the same thing as the line above
MyNewWorksheet.Delete
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Cells(1,1) = &quot;New Value&quot; 'Access the cells of the worksheet
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Cells.Clear 'Clear an entire worksheet, including formatting and cell values
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Columns(1).Sort key1:=Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Range(&quot;A1&quot;) 'Sort the first column
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Columns(1).Sort key1:=Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Range(&quot;A1&quot;), _
  order1:=xlDescending, header:=xlYes 'Use descending instead of ascending; do not sort
                                      ' the first cell, considering it a header
MyNewWorksheet2.Visible = xlSheetHidden
MyNewWorksheet2.Visible = xlSheetVisible
&lt;/source&gt;

Obtaining an existing sheet by name or creating it if it does not exist:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
NewSheetName = &quot;My Sheet&quot;
Set MySheet = Nothing
On Error Resume Next
Set MySheet = Sheets(NewSheetName)
On Error GoTo 0
If MySheet Is Nothing Then
  Set MySheet = Sheets.Add(After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count))
  MySheet.Name = NewSheetName
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Searching==
You can search for values in a sheet as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim SoughtString As String
SoughtString = &quot;London&quot;
Set ForeignKeySheet = Sheets(&quot;CitySize&quot;)
Set FoundCell = ForeignKeySheet.Columns(1).Find(SoughtString, LookAt:=xlWhole)
If Not FoundCell Is Nothing Then
  'The value associated with the key is in column 2
  CitySize = FoundCell.Offset(0, 1)
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to have a substring match, drop &quot;LookAt:=xlWhole&quot; or use &quot;LookAt:=xlPart&quot;.

==Cell Formatting==
You can format cells including text color, background color, font properties and border, but also formatting as a number, percent or text from VBA as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Selection.Characters.Font.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 'Foreground color AKA text color
  Selection.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 230) 'Background color
  Selection.Characters.Font.ColorIndex = xlAutomatic 'Reset foreground color
  Selection.Interior.Color = xlAutomatic 'Reset background color
  Selection.Font.Name = &quot;Verdana&quot; 'Font face
  Selection.Font.Size = 8 'Font size
  Selection.Font.Bold = True
  Selection.Font.Italic = True
  Selection.Font.Underline = True
  'Selection.Font.Strikethrough = True
  Selection.Font.Name = Application.StandardFont 'See also ClearFormats below
  Selection.Font.Size = Application.StandardFontSize 'See also ClearFormats below
  'Selection.Borders.LineStyle = xlLineStyleNone or xlDouble or xlDashDotDot or other
  Selection.Borders.Weight = xlMedium ' xlHairline, xlThin, xlMedium, or xlThick
  'Selection.Borders(xlEdgeBottom).Weight = xlThick
  ' LineStyle and Weight interact in strange ways.
  Selection.Borders.Color = RGB(127, 127, 0) 'Will be overridden below; applies to all borders
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeBottom).Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeTop).Color = RGB(0, 255, 0)
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeLeft).Color = RGB(0, 0, 255)
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeRight).Color = RGB(0, 127, 127)
  Selection.Borders(xlInsideHorizontal).Color = &amp;H7FFF00 'A tricky hex matching RGB(0, 255, 127)
  Selection.Borders(xlInsideVertical).Color = RGB(255, 127, 0)

  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;General&quot;
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;00&quot; 'As a number with zero decimal places, showing at least two digits
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;0.000&quot; 'As a number, showing three decimal places and no more
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;0.0%&quot; 'As a percent with one decimal place
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;@&quot; 'As text
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;0.00E+00&quot; 'As a number in scientific notation,
                                      'the string before E formatting the significand
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;m/d/yyyy&quot; 'As a date; whether &quot;/&quot; is shown depends on locale
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;d. mmmm yyyy hh:mm:ss&quot; 'As date, showing the month using a word,
                                      'also showing time
                                        
  Selection.ClearFormats 'Remove formatting, keeping cell content.
                         'Removes also the formatting set using NumberFormat.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Color==
In Excel VBA, RGB colors are plain numbers rather than objects. Some color examples are listed in [[#Cell Formatting]].

Some examples:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Selection.Characters.Font.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 'Foreground color AKA text color
Selection.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 230) 'Background color
Selection.Characters.Font.ColorIndex = xlAutomatic 'Reset foreground color
Selection.Comment.Shape.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(220, 255, 160)
'The above is the fill color, that is, the background color
Selection.Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font.ColorIndex = 3 'Red per default
'Selection.Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0) 'Does not work in Excel 2007
If False Then
  ActiveWorkbook.Colors(3) = RGB(200, 0, 0) 'Make the red in the index 5 a bit darker
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Setting the background color of the cells of the 1st column to the row number color index:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
For ColorIndex = 1 to 56
  Cells(ColorIndex,1).Interior.ColorIndex = ColorIndex 
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Color index in the default palette:
* 0 - Automatic
* 1 - Black
* 2 - White
* 3 - Red
* 4 - Green
* 5 - Blue
* 6 - Yellow
* 7 - Magenta
* 8 - Cyan
* 9 - Dark red
* 10 - Dark green
* 11 - Dark blue
* ... etc., through 56

Finding all cells whose text color approaches green:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
  TargetColor = RGB(0, 255, 0)
  Tolerance = 200
  'Extract the color components. The extraction is unneeded, but if the target
  'color came from the color of a selected cell, it would be needed.
  TmpColor = TargetColor
  TargetColorRed = TmpColor Mod 256
  TmpColor = TmpColor \ 256
  TargetColorGreen = TmpColor Mod 256
  TmpColor = TmpColor \ 256
  TargetColorBlue = TmpColor Mod 256

  For Each Cell In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells
    MyColor = Cell.Characters.Font.Color 'Color is a number
    'Extract the RGB components of the color
    Red = MyColor Mod 256
    MyColor = MyColor \ 256
    Green = MyColor Mod 256
    MyColor = MyColor \ 256
    Blue = MyColor Mod 256
    'Find the distance from the target color
    Distance = ((Red - TargetColorRed) ^ 2 + _
                (Green - TargetColorGreen) ^ 2 + _
                (Blue - TargetColorBlue) ^ 2) ^ 0.5
    If Distance &lt; Tolerance Then
      Cell.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 230) 'Mark the cell using its background color
    End If
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Visibility==
Hiding a '''row''' (hide a row, hide row):
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Rows(2).Hidden = True
'Rows(2).Hidden = False 'Show it again
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding several rows at once:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Range(&quot;A1:A3&quot;).EntireRow.Hidden = True 'Hide rows 1, 2, and 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding the rows of the currently selected cells:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Selection.EntireRow.Hidden = True
&lt;/source&gt;

Looping over rows that are visible AKA shown AKA not hidden:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For RowNo = 1 To 10
  If Not Rows(RowNo).Hidden Then
    'Do something on the row
  End If
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Toggling the visibility of rows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For RowNo = 1 To 10
  If Not Rows(RowNo).Hidden Then
    Rows(RowNo).Hidden = True
  Else
    Rows(RowNo).Hidden = False
  End If
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding a '''column''' (hide a column, hide column):
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Columns(2).Hidden = True
'Columns(2).Hidden = False 'Show it again
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding several columns at once:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Range(&quot;A1:C1&quot;).EntireColumn.Hidden = True 'Hide columns 1, 2, and 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding the columns of the currently selected cells:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Selection.EntireColumn.Hidden = True
&lt;/source&gt;

Other tricks pertaining to visibility of columns work in a direct analogy to the examples for rows above.

==Hyperlink==
Opening or following a hyperlink (open a hyperlink, follow a hyperlink, open hyperlink, follow hyperlink):

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;http://www.microsoft.com&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening the Wikipedia article for the article title found in the single active cell by opening a put-together URL:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot; &amp; ActiveCell
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening a Wikipedia article per article title in any of the currently selected cells:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
For Each Cell In Selection
  ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot; &amp; Cell
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening a local hyperlink, with a possible pop-up asking for confirmation for security reasons:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;file://C:\Users\Joe Hoe\Desktop\Test.txt&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Temporary file==
Getting a temporary file, with unclear robustness of the following method, which uses random numbers and tests for file existence:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Function GetTempFile(Prefix As String, Suffix As String) As String
  TempFolder = Environ$(&quot;tmp&quot;)
  Randomize
  While True
    TempFileName = TempFolder &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; Prefix &amp; CStr(Int(10000000 * Rnd)) &amp; Suffix
    If Dir(TempFileName) = &quot;&quot; Then 'Then the file does not exist
      GetTempFile = TempFileName
      Exit Function
    End If
  Wend
End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

* [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195763/en-us?fr=1 How To Use GetTempFileName API to Create a Unique Temporary File] at Microsoft.com

==Command Output==
If you do not mind a popping up console window, here is a way of obtaining output of a command from Excel VBA:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyShell = CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)
Set ExecObject = MyShell.Exec(&quot;tasklist /v&quot;)
' AllText = ExecObject.StdOut.ReadAll
Do While Not ExecObject.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  Line = ExecObject.StdOut.ReadLine()
  If InStr(Line, &quot;AcroRd32.exe&quot;) &gt; 0 Then
    'Do something
  End If
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

If having a console window popping up is not acceptable and you are okay with creating a temporary file, here is another way of obtaining output of a command from Excel VBA:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
'Summary: Run &quot;attrib&quot; on the file in column A (1) of the row
'of the currently selected cell, writing the result into
'column B (2) of the row.

'Get temp file name
TempFolder = Environ$(&quot;tmp&quot;)
Randomize
TempFileName = &quot;&quot;
While TempFileName = &quot;&quot;
  TempFileNameCand = TempFolder &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; &quot;mytmp&quot; &amp; CStr(Int(10000000 * Rnd)) &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;
  If Dir(TempFileNameCand) = &quot;&quot; Then 'Then the file does not exist
    TempFileName = TempFileNameCand
  End If
Wend
 
'Run the command
Set MyShell = CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)
MyCommand = &quot;cmd /c attrib &quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; Cells(Selection.Row, 1) &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot; &gt;&quot; &amp; TempFileName
MyShell.Run MyCommand, 0, True '0 = show no window
'Although attrib has an exe file, we need to use &quot;cmd&quot; for the
'redirection to work.

FileNo = FreeFile()
Open TempFileName For Input As #FileNo
While Not EOF(FileNo)
  Line Input #FileNo, MyLine
  Cells(Selection.Row, 2) = MyLine
Wend
Close #FileNo
Kill TempFileName 'Delete the file to clean up, although not strictly necessary
&lt;/source&gt;

==Dimensions==
Row height and column width:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Selection.RowHeight = 15
Cells(1,1).RowHeight = 15 'Can be applied to cells, not only to rows
Rows(4).AutoFit 'Automatically adjust row height
'Cells(4, 1).AutoFit 'Error
Cells(4, 1).EntireRow.AutoFit
Selection.EntireRow.AutoFit 'Auto fit the row height of the current selection
ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.AutoFit 'Auto fit the row height of the entire sheet
Selection.RowHeight = ActiveSheet.StandardHeight

Columns(1).ColumnWidth = 70
Cells(1,1).ColumnWidth = 70 'Can be applied to cells, not only to columns
Columns(2).AutoFit 'Automatically adjust column width
Selection.EntireRow.AutoFit 'Auto fit the column width of the current selection

==Comment==
Working with comment aka note:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
If Cells(1,1).Comment Is Nothing Then
  Cells(1,1).AddComment Text:=&quot;Hey&quot;
  'AddComment throws an error if the cell already has a comment
  'Range(&quot;A2:A3&quot;).AddComment Text:=&quot;Hey&quot; 'Error
  'AddComment throws an error if applies to more than one cell at once.
End If
Cells(1,1).Comment.Text Text:=Selection.Comment.Text &amp; &quot; there&quot;
Cells(1,1).Comment.Visible = True 'Prevent the comment from autohiding
Cells(1,1).Comment.Visible = False 'The default setting
Cells(1,1).Comment.Shape.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(220, 255, 160)
'The above is the fill color, that is, the background color
Cells(1,1).Comment.Shape.Height = 60
Cells(1,1).Comment.Shape.Width = 80
Cells(1,1).Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font.Name = &quot;Verdana&quot;
Cells(1,1).Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font.Size = 9
Cells(1,1).Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters(1, 3).Font.Bold = True
If False Then
  'Selection.Comment.Delete
  Cells(1,1).ClearComments
  Range(&quot;A1:A2&quot;).ClearComments 'Can apply to several cells at once
  Cells(1,1).PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteComments
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Collecting all comments of the sheet into a string:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;

== Add-Ins at Startup ==

Controlling what add-ins Excel opens at startup:

'''Microsoft Excel 2003:''' Configure loaded add-ins via Tools -&gt; Add-ins. Their list is mirrored in the following Registry key, but there's no advantage in editing the Registry:
 HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Init Commands

'''Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2:'''When you start Excel, it may automatically load addins (i.e. those you added from Tools -&gt; Add-Ins). The list of add-ins that get loaded come from the following registry key:
 HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Excel\Options
Under this key you may find a list of string-variables:
* OPEN
* OPEN1
* OPEN2
* etc...
The values of these variables is the name of the add-in. Excel, on start-up, will attempt to load the add-in in string-variable OPEN first, then OPEN1 (if present), onward until it runs out of such string-variables. It seems like Excel will automatically renumber the keys if they are not consecutive (i.e. OPEN1, OPEN3, OPEN4 will become OPEN1, OPEN2, OPEN3).

Note also the list of add-ins presented when you do Tools -&gt; Add-Ons is, in part, populated by the contents of the following key:
 HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Excel\Addin Manager

See also the following MS KB article: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/161439/EN-US/ How to Remove Entries from Add-Ins Dialog Box].

== Nuking Retained State ==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2
* OS: Windows XP

Nuking Excel's Retained State: Excel remembers all sorts of things between runs: What addins to load, what buttons and menus to display, etc. Sometime you'll want to clean all of this stuff up and bring Excel back to its factory state.

Nuking Excel Checklist:
#Make sure the following directories are empty:
##C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10\xlstart
##C:\apps\xp\application data\Microsoft\xlstart
#Nuke the auto-open keys from the registry(as shown below);
#Nuke all .xlbs – For example check here:
##C:\apps\xp\application data\Microsoft\Excel

'''Chili powder''' is a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]], made from assorted chiles (like anchos and arbol chiles). It is generally a red or green powder, and used often in chili con carne, the stew involving meat, tomato products, sometimes beans, and assorted chiles. It is similar to [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]].

==Ingredients==

*6 ancho chiles, stemmed and finely chopped
*3 dried arbol chiles, stemmed and finely chopped
*2 tbs garlic powder
*1 tbs dried oregano
*2 tbs whole toasted cumin

==Procedure==
#Give everything a run in a blender, food processor, or spice grinder until it's a fine powder.

'''Cooking Spray''' is normal cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] in a spray can.

==Warning==
Cooking spray is easy to ignite as it comes out of the can. Cooking spray cans may dangerously explode when heated.</text>

[[Image:ToastedWhiteBread.jpg|right|180px|thumb|American Toast.]]

'''Toast''' is sliced [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] which has been browned, to varying degrees, on each side by exposure to radiated heat. Historically, the bread was placed on a wire toasting fork and held before the red hot charcoal or embers of an open fire, and toasted one side at a time. It can be made by placing the bread slices under a hot grill or  broiler, and turning when one side of the bread is browned to taste. Nowadays, in most western countries, toast is usually made in an electric toaster which browns both sides of the bread simultaneously. Most toasters have a timing mechanism to control the degree of browning and &quot;pop up&quot; the bread slices when the toasting is complete. Toast often accompanies [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] foods, particularly [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]] and [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]. 

Toast can be eaten with a topping of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] and a classic combination of toppings is [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] with [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] sprinkled on top. The recipe uses about &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of sugar and 1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of cinnamon for each slice of bread. The butter is well-spread and melted first, so that the cinnamon and sugar will stick to the toast. 

==Ingredients==
*one or more slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], sized to fit your [[Cookbook:Toaster|toaster]]
*topping (optional)

==Procedure==
[[Image:Toaster.jpg|thumb|right|A Toaster]]

#Ensure that the [[Cookbook:Toaster|toaster]] is plugged in, generally clean, and functional.
#Place some bread slices into the toaster. Usually, you must place each slice into a separate slot. Some toasters can hold two slices in an extra-wide slot. If you use a [[Cookbook:Toaster Oven|toaster oven]], you may need to lay the bread slices flat on a metal grill inside the toaster oven.
#If the toaster has a darkness control, adjust it as desired.
#Activate the toaster.
#Watch the bread as it browns. If it starts to get excessively dark, activate the pop up mechanism and carefully remove the toast. If you are unable to make the toast pop out, unplug the toaster. Do not reach into a slotted toaster, whether with your hand or a metal tool, while it is plugged in or very hot.
#Spread your choice of topping on the toast with a [[Cookbook:Knife|knife]], [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]], or [[Cookbook:Spoon|spoon]].

==Toppings==
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*[[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*[[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]
*[[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]
*[[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*[[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*[[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]

==Variations==
*The bread crust can be cut off after the toast has been cooked. The topping can be added to both sides.
*Replace ordinary bread slices with a [[Cookbook:Bagel|bagel]] or [[Cookbook:English Muffin|English muffin]] cut across the axis.
*Butter would be the best topping choice when using  [[Cookbook:Raisin Bread|raisin bread]] to make toast.
*Replace each slice of bread with a [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffle]] or [[Cookbook:Scone|scone]].

'''Jelly''' is filtered and solidified [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] syrup.

The fruit is crushed or pureed, then boiled to reduce the amount of water. Depending on the type of fruit, additional [[Cookbook:Pectin|pectin]] or [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] may need to be added. If there is not enough pectin, the jelly will not solidify. At some point while the jelly is still liquid, it is filtered or strained to remove any seeds or skins.

'''Cranberry sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] or a [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] made by cooking cranberries, sugar, and often other ingredients together. Many, if not most, Americans are more familiar with the canned cranberry sauce which is a clear, solidified, jelly that is often valued for the property of maintaining the shape of the can in which it is packaged.

The fruit will generally come apart when vigorously [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], so there is no need to crush or puree it when a jam-style cranberry sauce is desired. Cranberry sauce can be made from cranberries and sugar alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Do Some Research==
Is that demo looking tempting enough to download? Or how about that brand new piece of hardware? Well before you do, perhaps you should do some research on it first. By doing your research you can avoid future potential problems by at least being aware of bugs, compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and undesirable inclusions like spyware &amp; adware. 

'''You can research:'''
* Reviews &amp; Ratings
* Frequently Asked Questions
* Release Notes
* Press Releases
* Version History
* System Requirements

==Update Everything==
Applications, operating systems, drivers... Nearly everything on your PC can be updated. Updates are often released to remove bugs, fix exploits, improve compatibility, optimize performance, add features, refresh databases, and enhance experiemce.

However you should be aware that some updates are purely optional and may be require certain conditions to be applicable, especially firmware updates.

While you should avoid interrupting software updates, you should never interrupt a firmware update.

'''You should update your:'''
* Anti-Virus
* Anti-Spyware / Anti-Adware
* Personal Firewall
* Operating System
* Internet Browsers
* Communications Software (E-Mail, IM, and Chat Clients)
* Productivity Suites
* Favorite Applications
* Device Drivers
* Firmware

'''You should run:'''
* Anti-Virus scans
* Disk - defragmentation tool
* Disk Cleanup wizard

A useful tutorial on a sequence for managing your computer's health is available at [http://seniornetwgtn.blogspot.com/] under the '''WORKSHOP NOTES''' heading ''Clean your PC''

==Keep your passwords safe==
Your passwords protect your files, your user accounts, and your online accounts, so don't you think you should protect your password?

'''General Guidelines:'''
* Avoid using personal data as passwords--you shouldn't use your birthday, your national insurance/social security number, or proper names as passwords.
* Include capital letters, numbers, and symbols.
* If you can, avoid using any word in the dictionary in your password, or any proper names. Crackers (criminal hackers) have lists of nearly all words in English, as well as other languages, and by using a special program, can test thousands of words per second against your password. Ideally, a password should be at least 8 characters (letters/numbers) long, and contain letters and numbers interspersed  throughout its length; for example &quot;9hyl8rn25g&quot;; do not use this example as your password! 
* Use multiple passwords.
* In general, don't EVER give your password to others, even other family members. There are normally ways they can obtain their own user accounts and passwords. Any person who knows a secret doubles the likelihood that secret will be revealed, at the very least.
* If someone you don't personally know asks you for your password, including individuals from the &quot;phone company&quot;, the &quot;cable company&quot;, the &quot;ISP&quot;, the &quot;bank&quot;, the &quot;police&quot;, the &quot;government&quot;, from &quot;corporate&quot;, from &quot;IT&quot; or &quot;MIS&quot;, or any individual purporting to hold a position of authority, generally assume that the request is malicious in nature, unless:
1. They ask you in person--not by phone, by email, or instant messenger;
2. You ask for and they show a tamper-proof photo identification card--merely wearing a uniform is insufficient;
3. You call where they came from, verify that they are actually who they say they are, and verify that in their job, they normally ask people for their passwords.
* Verify where you enter your password, especially on the Web. There are fake sites that look like real ones which are designed to trick you into giving out your password.
* When in doubt, change your password.

'''Keep the system free from all junk files:'''

* Remove all the files in the Temp Folder, Temporary Internet files Folder, History Folder and the recent document Folder. you can do this by doing the Disk Cleanup.

== Why were the pages on Set Theory moved to Topology? ==

I am wondering why these pages on Set Theory were moved under Topology.  Since Set Theory underlies many parts of mathematics (e.g. Discrete Mathematics as well), shouldn't a book on Set Theory stand on its own, with some less-thorough reference to Set Theory given in the books on Topology, Discrete Math, etc.?

I agree whole-heartedly.  If there is no objection in, say, a month, I will declare a consensus and move the restore this to being its own book.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:48, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

Ditto, merging with what's in Discrete Mathematics would be appreciated also.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 04:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

After many months of no objections, I hereby declare a consensus and have restored Set Theory as its own book. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:13, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity navbar ==

The Set Theory pages have a &lt;nowiki&gt;nav3&lt;/nowiki&gt; template creating backlinks to [[Wikiversity:School of Mathematics]] and their [[School of Mathematics:Pure Mathematics]].  However, this book was not created as part of Wikiveristy.  [[School of Mathematics:Pure Mathematics]] lists several &quot;Structured courses&quot;; each of these have this &lt;nowiki&gt;nav3&lt;/nowiki&gt; template with similar backlinks.  [[School of Mathematics:Pure Mathematics]] also lists several &quot;Texts for reference&quot;.  The idea, so it seems, is that these are books outside Wikiversity offering related material.  Of these only Set Theory has the backlinks to Wikiversity.  I would like to remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;nav3&lt;/nowiki&gt; template from the Set Theory pages.  If there is no objection after about a month, I will declare a consensus and remove it.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:30, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bayesian analysis is the branch of statistics based on the idea that we have some knowledge in advance about the probabilities that we are interested in, so called ''a priori'' probabilities. This might be your degree of belief in a particular event, the results from previous studies, or a general agreed-upon starting value for a probability. The terminology &quot;Bayesian&quot; comes from the Bayesian rule or law, a law about conditional probabilities. The opposite of &quot;Bayesian&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;Classical Statistics.&quot;

===Example===
Consider a box with 3 coins, with probabilities of showing heads respectively 1/4,  1/2 and 3/4. We choose arbitrarily one of the coins. Hence we take 1/3 as the a priori probability &lt;math&gt;P(C_1)&lt;/math&gt; of having chosen coin number 1. After 5 throws, in which X=4 times heads came up, it seems less likely that the coin is coin number 1. We calculate the a posteriori probability  that the coin is coin number 1, as:

:&lt;math&gt;P(C_1|X=4)=\frac{P(X=4|C_1)P(C_1)}{P(X=4)}=\frac{P(X=4|C_1)P(C_1)}{P(X=4|C_1)P(C_1)+P(X=4|C_2)P(C_2)+P(X=4|C_3)P(C_3)}=
\frac{ {5 \choose 4} (\frac 14)^4 \frac 34 \frac 13}
{{5 \choose 4} (\frac 14)^4 \frac 34 \frac 13+{5 \choose 4} (\frac 12)^4 \frac 12 \frac 13+{5 \choose 4} (\frac 34)^4 \frac 14 \frac 13}=
&lt;/math&gt;
In words:
: The probability that the Coin is the first Coin, given that we know heads came up 4 times... Is equal to the probability that heads came up 4 times given we know it's the first coin, times the probability that the coin is the first coin. All divided by the probability that heads comes up 4 times (ignoring which of the three Coins is chosen). The binomial coefficients cancel out as well as all denominators when expanding 1/2 to 2/4. This results in
::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{3}{3 + 32 + 81}=\frac{3}{116}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the same way we find:
:&lt;math&gt;P(C_2|X=4)=\frac{32}{3 + 32 + 81}=\frac{32}{116}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;P(C_3|X=4)=\frac{81}{3 + 32 + 81}=\frac{81}{116}&lt;/math&gt;.

This shows us that after examining the outcome of the five throws, it is most likely we did choose coin number 3.

Actually for a given result the denominator does not matter, only the relative Probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(C_i) = P(C_i|X=4)/P(X=4)&lt;/math&gt;
When the result is 3 times heads the Probabilities change in favor of Coin 2 and further as the following table shows:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Error handling|Libraries}}

Preprocessors are a way of making text processing with your C program before they are actually compiled. Before the actual compilation of every C program it is passed through a Preprocessor. The Preprocessor looks through the program trying to find out specific instructions called Preprocessor directives that it can understand. All Preprocessor directives begin with the # (hash) symbol.
C++ compilers use the same C preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Understanding C++/C Preprocessor]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[w:Preprocessor|preprocessor]] is a part of the compiler which performs preliminary operations (conditionally compiling code, including  files etc...) to your code before the compiler sees it.  These transformations are lexical, meaning that the output of the preprocessor is still text. 

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE: Technically the output of the preprocessing phase for C consists of a sequence of tokens, rather than source text, but it is simple to output source text which is equivalent to the given token sequence, and that is commonly supported by compilers via a &lt;tt&gt;-E&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/E&lt;/tt&gt; option -- although command line options to C compilers aren't completely standard, many follow similar rules.
|}

==Directives==
Directives are special instructions directed to the preprocessor (preprocessor directive) or to the [[w:compiler|compiler]] (compiler directive) on how it should process part or all of your source code or set some flags on the final object and are used to make writing source code easier (more portable for instance) and to make the source code more understandable. Directives are handled by the preprocessor, which is either a separate program invoked by the compiler or part of the compiler itself.

===#include===
C has some features as part of the language and some others as part of a '''standard library''', which is a repository of code that is available alongside every standard-conformant C compiler. When the C compiler compiles your program it usually also links it with the standard C library. For example, on encountering a &lt;code&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; directive, it replaces the directive with the contents of the &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; header file.

When you use features from the library, C requires you to ''declare'' what you would be using. The first line in the program is a '''preprocessing directive''' which should look like this:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

The above line causes the C declarations which are in the &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; [[w:Header file|header]] to be included for use in your program. Usually this is implemented by just inserting into your program the contents of a '''header file''' called &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt;, located in a system-dependent location. The location of such files may be described in your compiler's documentation. A list of standard C header files is listed below in the Headers table.

The &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; header contains various declarations for input/output (I/O) using an abstraction of I/O mechanisms called '''streams'''. For example there is an output stream object called &lt;tt&gt;stdout&lt;/tt&gt; which is used to output text to the standard output, which usually displays the text on the computer screen.

If using angle brackets like the example above, the preprocessor is instructed to search for the include file along the development environment path for the standard includes.

 #include &quot;other.h&quot;

If you use  quotation marks (&lt;tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;), the preprocessor is expected to search in some additional, usually user-defined, locations for the header file, and to fall back to the standard include paths only if it is not found in those additional locations.  It is common for this form to include searching in the same directory as the file containing the &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; directive.

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE: You should check the documentation of the development environment you are using for any vendor specific implementations of the &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; directive.

* &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Wctype.h|&lt;wctype.h&gt;]]&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===#pragma===
The '''pragma''' (pragmatic information) directive is part of the standard, but the meaning of any pragma depends on the software implementation of the standard that is used. The #pragma directive provides a way to request special behavior from the compiler. This directive is most useful for programs that are unusually large or that need to take advantage of the capabilities of a particular compiler. 

Pragmas are used within the source program.

 #pragma token(s)

#pragma is usually followed by a single token, which represents a command for the compiler to obey. You should check the software implementation of the C standard you intend on using for a list of the supported tokens. Not surprisingly, the set of commands that can appear in #pragma directives is different for each compiler; you'll have to consult the documentation for your compiler to see which commands it allows and what those commands do. 

For instance one of the most implemented preprocessor directives, &lt;code&gt;#pragma once&lt;/code&gt; when placed at the beginning of a header file, indicates that the file where it resides will be skipped if included several times by the preprocessor.

NOTE: Other methods exist to do this action that is commonly referred as using '''include guards'''.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===&lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt;===

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fff2f2; border: solid 1px #ffbfbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
WARNING: Preprocessor macros, although tempting, can produce quite unexpected results if not done right. Always keep in mind that macros are textual substitutions done to your source code before anything is compiled. The compiler does not know anything about the macros and never gets to see them. This can produce obscure errors, amongst other negative effects. Prefer to use language features, if there are equivalent (In example use &lt;code&gt;const int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;d constants).

That said, there are cases, where macros are very useful (see the &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt; macro below for an example).    
|}

The &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; directive is used to define values or macros that are used by the preprocessor to manipulate the program source code before it is compiled.  Because preprocessor definitions are substituted before the compiler acts on the source code, any errors that are introduced by &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; are difficult to trace.  

By convention, values defined using &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; are named in uppercase.  Although doing so is not a requirement, it is considered very bad practice to do otherwise.  This allows the values to be easily identified when reading the source code.

Today, &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; is primarily used to handle compiler and platform differences. E.g., a define might hold a constant which is the appropriate error code for a system call.  The use of &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; should thus be limited unless absolutely necessary; &lt;tt&gt;typedef&lt;/tt&gt; statements and constant variables can often perform the same functions more safely.  

Another feature of the &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; command is that it can take arguments, making it rather useful as a pseudo-function creator. Consider the following code: 

 #define ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ( ((x) &lt; 0) ? -(x) : (x) )
 ...
 int x = -1;
 while( ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ) {
 ...
 }
		
It's generally a good idea to use extra parentheses when using complex macros. Notice that in the above example, the variable &quot;x&quot; is always within its own set of parentheses. This way, it will be evaluated in whole, before being compared to 0 or multiplied by -1. Also, the entire macro is surrounded by parentheses, to prevent it from being contaminated by other code. If you're not careful, you run the risk of having the compiler misinterpret your code.

Because of side-effects it is considered a very bad idea to use macro functions as described above.

 int x = -10;
 int y = ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x++ );

If ABSOLUTE_VALUE() were a real function 'x' would now have the value of '-9', but because it was an argument in a macro it was expanded twice and thus has a value of -8.

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fefefe; border: solid 1px black; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
Example:

To illustrate the dangers of macros, consider this naive macro
 #define MAX(a,b) a&gt;b?a:b
and the code
 i = MAX(2,3)+5;
 j = MAX(3,2)+5;
Take a look at this and consider what the value after execution might be.  The statements are turned into 
 int i = 2&gt;3?2:3+5;
 int j = 3&gt;2?3:2+5;
Thus, after execution &lt;tt&gt;i=8&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j=3&lt;/tt&gt; instead of the expected result of &lt;tt&gt;i=j=8&lt;/tt&gt;! This is why you were cautioned to use an extra set of parenthesis above, but even with these, the road is fraught with dangers. The alert reader might quickly realize that if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; contains expressions, the definition must parenthesize every use of &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; in the macro definition, like this:
 #define MAX(a,b) ((a)&gt;(b)?(a):(b))
This works, provided &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; have no side effects. Indeed, 
 i = 2;
 j = 3;
 k = MAX(i++, j++);
would result in &lt;tt&gt;k=4&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i=3&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j=5&lt;/tt&gt;. This would be highly surprising to anyone expecting &lt;tt&gt;MAX()&lt;/tt&gt; to behave like a function.

So what is the correct solution? The solution is not to use macro at all. A global, inline function, like this

 inline int max(int a, int b) { 
   return a&gt;b?a:b 
 }

has none of the pitfalls above, but will not work with all types.

| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE: The explicit &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; declaration is not really necessary unless the definition is in a header file, since your compiler can inline functions for you (with gcc this can be done with &lt;code&gt;-finline-functions&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt;). The compiler is often better than the programmer at predicting which functions are worth inlining. Also, function calls are not really expensive (they used to be). 

The compiler is actually free to ignore the &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; keyword. It is only a hint (except that &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; is necessary in order to allow a function to be defined in a header file without generating an error message due to the function being defined in more than one translation unit).

('''#, ##''')

The '''#''' and '''##''' operators are used with the &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; macro. Using # causes the first argument after the '''#''' to be returned as a string in quotes. For example, the command 

 #define as_string( s ) # s
		
will make the compiler turn this command 

 puts( as_string( Hello World! ) ) ;
		
into 

 puts( &quot;Hello World!&quot; );
		
Using '''##''' concatenates what's before the '''##''' with what's after it. For example, the command 

 #define concatenate( x, y ) x ## y
 ...
 int xy = 10;
 ...
	
will make the compiler turn 

 printf( &quot;%d&quot;, concatenate( x, y ));
		
into 

 printf( &quot;%d&quot;, xy);
		
which will, of course, display &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt; to standard output.

It is possible to concatenate a macro argument with a constant prefix or suffix to obtain a valid identifier as in

 #define make_function( name ) int my_ ## name (int foo) {}
 make_function( bar )

which will define a function called &lt;tt&gt;my_bar()&lt;/tt&gt;. But it isn't possible to integrate a macro argument into a constant string using the concatenation operator. In order to obtain such an effect, one can use the ANSI C property that two or more consecutive string constants are considered equivalent to a single string constant when encountered. Using this property, one can write

 #define eat( what ) puts( &quot;I'm eating &quot; #what &quot; today.&quot; )
 eat( fruit )

which the macro-processor will turn into

 puts( &quot;I'm eating &quot; &quot;fruit&quot; &quot; today.&quot; )

which in turn will be interpreted by the C parser as a single string constant.

The following trick can be used to turn a numeric constants into string literals

 #define num2str(x) str(x)
 #define str(x) #x
 #define CONST 23
 
 puts(num2str(CONST));

This is a bit tricky, since it is expanded in 2 steps. First &lt;code&gt;num2str(CONST)&lt;/code&gt; is replaced with &lt;code&gt;str(23)&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn is replaced with &lt;code&gt;&quot;23&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. This can be useful in the following example:

 #ifdef DEBUG
 #define debug(msg) fputs(__FILE__ &quot;:&quot; num2str(__LINE__) &quot; - &quot; msg, stderr)
 #else
 #define debug(msg)
 #endif

This will give you a nice debug message including the file and the line where the message was issued. If DEBUG is not defined however the debugging message will completely vanish from your code. Be careful not to use this sort of construct with anything that has side effects, since this can lead to bugs, that appear and disappear depending on the compilation parameters.

===macros===

Macros aren't type-checked and so they do not evaluate arguments. Also, they do not obey scope properly, but simply take the string passed to them and replace each occurrence of the macro argument in the text of the macro with the actual string for that parameter (the code is literally copied into the location it was called from).

An example on how to use a macro:
&lt;pre&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 #define SLICES 8
 #define ADD(x) ( (x) / SLICES )

 int main(void) 
 {
   int a = 0, b = 10, c = 6;

   a = ADD(b + c);
   printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, a);
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

NOTE:&lt;br&gt;
It is usually bad practice to define macros in headers.

A macro should be defined only when it is not possible to achieve the same result with a 
function or some other mechanism. Some compilers are able to optimize code to where calls to small functions are replaced with inline code, negating any possible speed advantage.
Using typedefs, enums, and &lt;tt&gt;inline&lt;/tt&gt; (in C99) is often a better option.
|}

One of the few situations where inline functions won't work -- so you are pretty much forced to use function-like macros instead -- is to initialize compile time constants (static initialization of structs).
This happens when the arguments to the macro are literals that the compiler can optimize to another literal.

===#error===
The '''#error''' directive halts compilation.   When one is encountered the standard specifies that the compiler should emit a diagnostic containing the remaining tokens in the directive.  This is mostly used for debugging purposes.

 #error message

===#warning===

Many compilers support a  '''#warning''' directive. When one is encountered, the compiler emits a diagnostic containing the remaining tokens in the directive.

#warning message

===#undef===
The '''#undef''' directive undefines a macro.  The identifier need not have been previously defined.

===#if,#else,#elif,#endif (conditionals)===
The '''#if''' command checks whether a controlling conditional expression evaluates to zero or nonzero, and excludes or includes a block of code respectively. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
 #if 1
 /* This block will be included */
 #endif
 #if 0
 /* This block will not be included */
 #endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

The conditional expression could contain any C operator except for the assignment operators, the increment and decrement operators, the address-of operator, and the sizeof operator.

One unique operator used in preprocessing and nowhere else is the '''defined''' operator. It returns 1 if the macro name, optionally enclosed in parentheses, is currently defined; 0 if not.

The '''#endif''' command ends a block started by &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;#ifndef&lt;/code&gt;.

The '''#elif''' command is similar to &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, except that it is used to extract one from a series of blocks of code. E.g.:

&lt;pre&gt;
 #if /* some expression */
   :
   :
   :
 #elif /* another expression */
   :
 /* imagine many more #elifs here ... */
   :
 #else
 /* The optional #else block is selected if none of the previous #if or
    #elif blocks are selected */
   :
   :
 #endif /* The end of the #if block */
&lt;/pre&gt;

===#ifdef,#ifndef===

The '''#ifdef''' command is similar to &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, except that the code block following it is selected if a macro name is defined. In this respect,

 #ifdef NAME

is equivalent to

 #if defined NAME



The '''#ifndef''' command is similar to '''#ifdef''', except that the test is reversed:

 #ifndef NAME

is equivalent to

 #if !defined NAME

== Useful Preprocessor Macros for Debugging ==
ANSI C defines some useful preprocessor macros and variables,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://docs.hp.com/en/B3901-90003/ch07s04.html HP C Compiler Reference Manual]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/preprocessor/preprocessor_vars C++ reference: Predefined preprocessor variables]
&lt;/ref&gt;
also called &quot;magic constants&quot;, include:

__FILE__   =&gt; The name of the current file, as a string literal&lt;br/&gt;
__LINE__   =&gt; Current line of the source file, as a numeric literal&lt;br/&gt;
__DATE__   =&gt; Current system date, as a string&lt;br/&gt;
__TIME__   =&gt; Current system time, as a string&lt;br/&gt;
__TIMESTAMP__ =&gt; Date and time (non-standard)&lt;br/&gt;
__cplusplus =&gt; undefined when your C code is being compiled by a C compiler; 199711L when your C code is being compiled by a C++ compiler compliant with 1998 C++ standard.&lt;br/&gt;
__func__ =&gt; Current function name of the source file, as a string (part of C99)&lt;br/&gt;
__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ =&gt; &quot;decorated&quot; Current function name of the source file, as a string (in GCC; non-standard)&lt;br/&gt;

==== Compile-time assertions ====

Some people&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.jaggersoft.com/pubs/CVu11_3.html &quot;Compile Time Assertions in C&quot;] by Jon Jagger 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;
define a preprocessor macro to allow compile-time assertions, something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(pred) switch(0){case 0:case pred:;}

COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT( BOOLEAN CONDITION );
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;static_assert.hpp&lt;/code&gt; [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost | Boost library]] defines a similar macro.
Some compilers define a &lt;code&gt;static_assert&lt;/code&gt; keyword used in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: C++0x#Static assertions]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Such compile-time assertions can help you debug faster than using only run-time assert() statements,
because the compile-time assertions are all tested at compile time,
while it is possible that a test run of a program may fail to exercise some run-time assert() statements.

==== X-Macros ====
One little-known usage pattern of the C preprocessor is known as &quot;X-Macros&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;X_macros&quot;&gt;Wirzenius, Lars.

2009.
Includes &quot;Practical Applications of the Preprocessor II: The X Macro Trick&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
An X-Macro is a [[C++ Programming‎/Programming Languages‎/C++‎/Code/File Organization#.h|header file]] or macro.  Commonly these use the extension &quot;.def&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;.h&quot;. This file contains a list of similar macro calls, which can be referred to as &quot;component macros&quot;.  The include file is then referenced repeatedly in the following pattern.  Here, the include file is &quot;xmacro.def&quot; and it contains a list of component macros of the style &quot;foo(x, y, z)&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define foo(x, y, z) doSomethingWith(x, y, z);
#include &quot;xmacro.def&quot;
#undef foo

#define foo(x, y, z) doSomethingElseWith(x, y, z);
#include &quot;xmacro.def&quot;
#undef foo

(etc...)
&lt;/source&gt;

The most common usage of X-Macros is to establish a list of C objects and then automatically generate code for each of them. Some implementations also perform any &lt;code&gt;#undef&lt;/code&gt;s they need inside the X-Macro, as opposed to expecting the caller to undefine them.

Common sets of objects are a set of global configuration settings, a set of members of a [[struct (C programming language)|struct]], a list of possible [[XML]] tags for converting an XML file to a quickly-traversable tree, or the body of an [[enumerated type|enum]] declaration; other lists are possible.

Once the X-Macro has been processed to create the list of objects, the component macros can be redefined to generate, for instance, [[mutator method|accessor and/or mutator]] functions.  Structure [[serialization|serializing and deserializing]] are also commonly done.

Here is an example of an X-Macro that establishes a struct and automatically creates serialize/deserialize functions. For simplicity, this example doesn't account for endianness or buffer overflows.

File '''star.def''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(x, int)
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(y, int)
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(z, int)
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(radius, double)
#undef EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
&lt;/source&gt;

File '''star_table.c''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) type member;
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  } starStruct;

void serialize_star(const starStruct *const star, unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(buffer, &amp;(star-&gt;member), sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }

void deserialize_star(starStruct *const star, const unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(&amp;(star-&gt;member), buffer, sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Handlers for individual data types may be created and accessed using token concatenation (&quot;&lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) and quoting (&quot;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) operators.
For example, the following might be added to the above code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define print_int(val)    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, val)
#define print_double(val) printf(&quot;%g&quot;, val)

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* print_##type will be replaced with print_int or print_double */
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot;, #member); \
    print_##type(star-&gt;member); \
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that in this example you can also avoid the creation of separate handler functions for each datatype in this example by defining the print format for each supported type, with the additional benefit of reducing the expansion code produced by this header file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define FORMAT_(type) FORMAT_##type
#define FORMAT_int    &quot;%d&quot;
#define FORMAT_double &quot;%g&quot;

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* FORMAT_(type) will be replaced with FORMAT_int or FORMAT_double */
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot; FORMAT_(type) &quot;\n&quot;, #member, star-&gt;member);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The creation of a separate header file can be avoided by creating a single macro containing what would be the contents of the file.  For instance, the above file &quot;star.def&quot; could be replaced with this macro at the beginning of:

File '''star_table.c''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define EXPAND_STAR \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(x, int) \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(y, int) \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(z, int) \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(radius, double)
&lt;/source&gt;

and then all calls to &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;star.def&quot;&lt;/code&gt; could be replaced with a simple &lt;code&gt;EXPAND_STAR&lt;/code&gt; statement.  The rest of the above file would become:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) type member;
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  } starStruct;

void serialize_star(const starStruct *const star, unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(buffer, &amp;(star-&gt;member), sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  }

void deserialize_star(starStruct *const star, const unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(&amp;(star-&gt;member), buffer, sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

and the print handler could be added as well as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define print_int(val)    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, val)
#define print_double(val) printf(&quot;%g&quot;, val)

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* print_##type will be replaced with print_int or print_double */
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot;, #member); \
    print_##type(star-&gt;member); \
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define FORMAT_(type) FORMAT_##type
#define FORMAT_int    &quot;%d&quot;
#define FORMAT_double &quot;%g&quot;

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* FORMAT_(type) will be replaced with FORMAT_int or FORMAT_double */
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot; FORMAT_(type) &quot;\n&quot;, #member, star-&gt;member);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

A variant which avoids needing to know the members of any expanded sub-macros is to accept the operators as an argument to the list macro:

File '''star_table.c''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*
 Generic
 */
#define STRUCT_MEMBER(member, type, dummy) type member;

#define SERIALIZE_MEMBER(member, type, obj, buffer) \
  memcpy(buffer, &amp;(obj-&gt;member), sizeof(obj-&gt;member)); \
  buffer += sizeof(obj-&gt;member);

#define DESERIALIZE_MEMBER(member, type, obj, buffer) \
  memcpy(&amp;(obj-&gt;member), buffer, sizeof(obj-&gt;member)); \
  buffer += sizeof(obj-&gt;member);

#define FORMAT_(type) FORMAT_##type
#define FORMAT_int    &quot;%d&quot;
#define FORMAT_double &quot;%g&quot;

/* FORMAT_(type) will be replaced with FORMAT_int or FORMAT_double */
#define PRINT_MEMBER(member, type, obj) \
  printf(&quot;%s: &quot; FORMAT_(type) &quot;\n&quot;, #member, obj-&gt;member);

/*
 starStruct
 */

#define EXPAND_STAR(_, ...) \
  _(x, int, __VA_ARGS__) \
  _(y, int, __VA_ARGS__) \
  _(z, int, __VA_ARGS__) \
  _(radius, double, __VA_ARGS__)

typedef struct {
  EXPAND_STAR(STRUCT_MEMBER, )
  } starStruct;

void serialize_star(const starStruct *const star, unsigned char *buffer) {
  EXPAND_STAR(SERIALIZE_MEMBER, star, buffer)
  }

void deserialize_star(starStruct *const star, const unsigned char *buffer) {
  EXPAND_STAR(DESERIALIZE_MEMBER, star, buffer)
  }

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  EXPAND_STAR(PRINT_MEMBER, star)
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This approach can be dangerous in that the entire macro set is always interpreted as if it was on a single source line, which could encounter compiler limits with complex component macros and/or long member lists.

This technique was reported by Lars Wirzenius&lt;ref&gt;Wirzenius, Lars. [http://liw.iki.fi/liw/texts/cpp-trick.html C Preprocessor Trick For Implementing Similar Data Types] Retrieved January 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in a web page dated January 17, 2000, in which he gives credit to Kenneth Oksanen for &quot;refining and developing&quot; the technique prior to 1997.  The other references describe it as a method from at least a decade before the turn of the century.

== The package Text_IO ==

Used for simple [[Ada Programming/Input Output|Input Output]] (IO) in text format.

== Tips and Tricks for Text_IO ==

=== Read a whole line from the console with Ada 95 ===

The &lt;code&gt;Get_Line ()&lt;/code&gt; procedure gets a line of text up until the receiving string fills up. If the line is longer than the buffer then you need to read it more than once. The following example from [[Ada Programming/Mathematical calculations|Mathematical calculations]] shows how this is done:

{{Ada/Sourceforge|numeric_4.adb}}

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
  
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Numeric_4 {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Str {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
   {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 ...
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_Line {{Ada/kw|return}} Str.Unbounded_String {{Ada/kw|is}}
      BufferSize : {{Ada/kw|constant}} := 2000;
      Retval     : Str.Unbounded_String := Str.Null_Unbounded_String;
      Item       : String (1 .. BufferSize);
      Last       : Natural;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      Get_Whole_Line :
         {{Ada/kw|loop}}
            T_IO.Get_Line (Item =&gt; Item, Last =&gt; Last);
 
            Str.Append (Source =&gt; Retval, New_Item =&gt; Item (1 .. Last));
 
            {{Ada/kw|exit}} Get_Whole_Line {{Ada/kw|when}} Last &lt; Item'{{Ada/attribute|Last}};
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} Get_Whole_Line;
         {{Ada/kw|return}} Retval;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Get_Line;
 
 ...


Ada 2005 has a function Get_Line which returns a newly created string which contains the whole string.

=== Reading a whole line from a file with Ada 95 ===

In principle it is the same as in console reading but you have to check for the end of file as well:

         {{Ada/kw|exit}} Get_Whole_Line {{Ada/kw|when}} Last &lt; Item'{{Ada/attribute|Last}}
                      {{Ada/kw|or}} IO.End_Of_File (File);

If you have to write code that can be used on various platforms (OS 9, OS X, and windows) you will run into some problems with psychtoolbox. This is due to different versions that run on different platforms and having different procedures for handling the screen. 

Using a few scripts that handle these differences, and calling these scripts can make your programs a little more universally accepted.

The scripts listed here will be changing often to match the current versions of the psychtoolbox, and you should check to see if your version is up to date. If you make any changes to the scripts on these pages, please make note of the date of the revision and what you changed, so that users of the scripts will know what was updtated.

===Scripts and functions===
*[[Psychtoolbox:ptb_ind_screen_setup.m|ptb_ind_screen_setup.m]] - April 7, 2005 - This script is used to set up the psychtoolbox screen function in a 
universal way to allow the same program to be run on windows, OS X,
and classic mac.
 
*[[Psychtoolbox:ptb_ind_flip.m|ptb_ind_flip.m]]- April 7, 2005 - 
This function is set up to allow the same code to be used in the 
new and old versions of psychtoolbox
&lt;br&gt;
screen_setup should be called at the begining of your script. This
should be called whenever you want to put what you have drawn 
on the screen.

*[[Psychtoolbox:ptb_ind_general_setup.m|ptb_ind_general_setup.m]] - July 6, 2005 - Used for other general setup information (directory seperation - / or :, left arrow right arrow interpretations, etc)

===Examples of use===
*[[Psychtoolbox:expanding_rectangle.m|expanding_rectangle.m]] - April 7, 2005

I was considering writing an automated job for the source code translations - but now I wonder if there is one already and I am too late ;-). --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:45, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== program for inserting the templates? ===

If you mean a program for inserting the templates - I have writen an ugly emacs script but it is full of bugs. It helps me in doing the translation but I still have to manually edit the page and load it in emacs with mozex (a mozilla extension). Of course the better would be to have a bot that downloads the page and performs the necessary conversion, too much for me. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:10, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Yes, using AdaCL ===

I was considering an AdaCL script and down/upload is not an issue since the aim is for &quot;working demos&quot; and they need real and tested source codes anyway. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:10, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

Put the new vertices on the gray line? What gray line??

Bryan

&quot;Then, select the vertices in the middle of the bone and press GKEY for grab and put it down like this.&quot;

Like what?? Please provide the pictures... We are all beginners here, how are we suppose to know what you mean by 'like this'??

Stanley, yet another frustrated beginner.

: Don't worry guys, here you will see all those nice missing pictures in the future. In the meantime you can check other finished [[Blender 3D: Tutorial Links List|Blender tutorials]].--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 11:52, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)


==Illustrations==
For those who need illustrations like myself, go to this website: [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/book1.html]http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/book1.html

Then, scroll down to 'Table of Contents' and click on 'Your first animation in 30+30 minutes'. This guide you in building your gingerbreadman, but with more illustrations. Enjoy your learnings!

:That link seems to be invalid now. However, Googling for the name, it seems that the gingerbreadman tutorial is also available here: http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/c1208.html --[[User:Slapout|Slapout]] 21:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::That one looks dead also. Here's new link http://docs.huihoo.com/blender/user-guide-2.3/ch04.html found from Google -- Roli

Added a simple graphic for the meantime. It should look better, but at least people will be able to understand what to do.


==Added images==
I added some images and then changed the text to be consistent with what was produced.  A speherical head just didn't make sense for a gingerbread man.
--[[user:Darkonc|Darkonc]] 11:33  6 Oct 2005 (PDT)


==Smoothing the head==
The text said to smooth the head first but the picture showed the body smoothed first. It doesn't matter which you smooth first, so I changed the order in the text. Also, the intro description says this page will cover basic lighting, but it doesn't. Should the page be marked as incomplete?
[[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 20:23, 30 October 2005 (UTC)


== Redundant tutorial (double)==
This feels just like the man produced in the earlier steps, with the exception that this one feels easier... Replace? [[User:81.224.183.67|81.224.183.67]] 20:27, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

I think the original gingerbread man tutorial also included armature and simple animation.
[[User:69.91.82.27|69.91.82.27]] 22:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, i totally agree. This didnt bring any new knowledge inn. Its just plain simple, and a lack of progress.

This could become an advanced tutorial in modeling, if the gum drops and the  way to texture them, as well as adding bones, and how to add/remove mesh areas from bones they don't belong too were added. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:21, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

This tutorial doesn't seem to be very different from modelling a simple person 1 and 2.

== Improper Modeling Technique ==

The head should not be a separate object from the body. Why don't we scrap this tutorial altogether?

: I may just be a noob, but all these reasons for removal sound good to me. Didn't introduce anything new really. Go ahead! Remove! Or add as a footnote to the simple man modelling.


== Great texture button screen shots ==
I think the great screen shots of the texture panels should be added to the volcano tutorial. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:22, 8 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

Gujarati is a language with grammatical gender. There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

Nouns can often, but by no means always, be identified as to their gender according to their ending. These same gender-linked suffixes are used to make adjectives, verbs, and even adverbs agree with nouns in Gujarati sentences.

==Introduction==
Brew is Qualcomm's mobile operating system for mobile handsets.  Prior to version 2.0 Qualcomm did not offer J2ME for their platform.  Usually, to determine the optional APIs(JSRs) you end up tracking by JVM Vendor and version on device.

==Brew 2.0==
*Supports MIDP 2.0 CLDC 1.0 via on air download of JVM, not fully enabled out of box.

==Brew 2.1(True Brew)==
The Esmertec JBed CLDC is one of the JVM solutions used by OEMs for Brew. Here I have listed the minimum known common J2ME components as you will have to track by JVM Vendor and JVM version on device to detemine the optional APIs(JSRs) that you can access on that device.

*Supports MIDP 2.0 and CLDC 1.0 fully enabled
*WMA JSR 120
*MMAPI JSR 135

==Brew 3.0==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Artic 
a.k.a Robert Engelhardt

==Education==
Robert holds a bachelors degree in Computer Science, which essentially means he spends entirely too much time in front of a computer. This doesn’t necessarily mean he knows how to use a computer better than anyone without such a degree, it just means he knows a few more technical terms he can shout between curses as everything goes wrong.
Robert also nearly held a minor in psychology, but decided against that rout when it meant that he would have to stay on an extra semester to get it.

==Hobbies==
Other than his interest in beekeeping, Robert also enjoys SCUBA diving, gardening, cooking and computer programming.

==Wiki Books Worked On==
===[[Beekeeping]]===
Robert has been interested in bees and beekeeping for a while but has not yet had the ability to actually keep bees until this year (2005). Right now his intentions are to remain a hobbyist, but he would like to introduce the world to such an entreating and possibly even profitable hobby by beginning a [[Beekeeping]] Wiki Book and adding to other such Wikis.
===[[Cookbook]]===
In some degree of relation to beekeeping, Robert tends to (or wants to) post recipes in regards to [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]; after all it is a spectacular substance that he believes is quite underrated.

One recipe Robert enjoys particular is [[Cookbook:Honey Taffy| Honey Taffy]], why not give it a try.

==Contact Info==
Robert can be contacted via e-mail at rheone &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt; at &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; gmail &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt; dot &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; com

==Special Thanks==
Robert is not known for perfect grammar, or spelling and he finds it hard enough to talk about himself in 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; person, but continues to do it in this profile regardless. Either way, Robert is aware of many of his imperfections, and if you become aware of any of them please correct them. Robert thanks you :)</text>

==Introduction==
Palm through its PalmOS operating system for PDAs does not supply JVMs packaged with its OS.  However, within the different platforms of PalmOS several JVMs have been provided.

==68K==
*MIDP 1.0
*CLDC 1.0
*JVM supplied by Sun as MIDP4Palm

==PalmOS Garnet==
JVMs provided for the Garnet 5.2 and Garnet 5.4 devices:
*MIDP 2.0
*CLDC 1.1
*Web Services JSR 172
*PIM JSR 75
*FileConnection 1.0(GCF)
*JVM is IBM's WEME(known by project name of J9)

Typcial devices:
*Treo 600
*Treo 650
*Tungsten C
*Tungsten T3
*Tungsten E
*Tungsten E2
*Tungsten T5
*Zire 72
*Palm TX

==Conclusion==
While JVMs are not packaged with PalmOS directly, we can still determine the MIDP/CLDC versions and optional apis by tracking by a combination of device and by JVM OEM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''What is Universal Design?'''&lt;br&gt; ==
Universal Design seeks to make instruction available and accessible to all learners. Limitations for learning should not present themselves due to differences in learning style, ability, or background.   

Universal Design does not support a one-size-fits all philosophy.  To the contrary, it emphasizes that learning opportunities need to be flexible to meet diverse needs.  If materials are designed for universal use, they will not need to be altered for use.  Differentiation will occur naturally.

Research is being completed to further develop an understanding of and practical uses for Universal Design.   [http://www.cast.org The Center for Applied Special Technology] is focusing on brain research and multimedia technology as research avenues that will further comprehension for designing effective instruction for all people.

== '''Origins of Universal Design''' ==
Universal Design originated in the field of architecture.  It seeks to meet the needs of a diverse public by making buildings accessible to all users.  To ensure that this occurs, the fundamentals of universal design   must be incorporated into the design process from the initial stages of the project. 

Universal design should benefit more than one group of users.  For example, curb ramps on sidewalks aid people in wheel chairs, people pushing strollers, and people riding bicycles.   

== '''Principles of Universal Design''' ==
Universal-design principles emphasize equitable use, flexibility, and adaptability.&lt;br&gt;
These standards are met by creating materials with the following qualities:

* '''Simplicity:''' Materials should be simple, intuitive, and easy to comprehend, regardless of the user's prior knowledge or skill set. 

* '''Clarity:''' Materials should provide clear directions, questions and expectations. 

* '''Accessibility:''' Materials should be usable with minimal physical effort. 

* '''Legibility:'''  Materials should be sized spaced for ease of viewing. &lt;br&gt;

* '''Positive:''' Materials should minimize accommodate unintended actions or errors with feedback.

* '''Supportive:''' Materials should provide built-in supports, such as help, multi-modality, and faculty-contact information.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For more information on the principles of Universal Design visit either of the following web sites:&lt;br&gt;

[http://web.archive.org/web/20050301193835/http://telr.osu.edu/dpg/fastfact/mswfiles/UniversalDesign.doc Universal Instructional Design, Ohio State University]

== '''Jakob Nielsen''' ==

[http://www.nngroup.com/ Nielsen] is a fore runner with regard to making things available to people.  His research focuses on universal design, usability, and accessibility for the Internet.  He has developed Web design guidelines that serve as a checklist for whether or not a website possesses user centered design.  He has patents on 76 different items, most are different things that can be used to make the Internet more accessible to a wide range of people with special needs.

== '''Usability''' ==

Five attributes can be assessed to determine the ease of interface usage.  &lt;br&gt;

* Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks? &lt;br&gt;

* Efficiency: How quickly can they perform tasks? &lt;br&gt;

* Memorability: How easily can they re-establish proficiency? &lt;br&gt;

* Error: How many errors on the site?  What occurs if an error is made?  &lt;br&gt;

* Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the site?

== '''Web Accessibility''' ==

[[Instructional Technology/Web Content Accessibility Guidelines/W3C guidelines|The World Wide Web Consortium]](W3C) develops and maintains the protocols used on the Web to insure interoperability to promote universal access. The W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has proposed guidelines for all Web authors.
Designing a well-organized Web site helps visitors navigate through the information presented. Some web development packages, such as [[Instructional Technology/Macromedia Dreamweaver|Macromedia Dreamweaver]], now possess the capability to preview page designs as they would look in different web browsers.  
*Maintain a simple, consistent page layout throughout your site. 
*Keep backgrounds simple. Make sure there is enough contrast. 
*Use standard HTML. 
*Caption video and transcribe other audio. 
*Make links descriptive so that they are understood out of context. 
*Include appropriate ALT/LONGDESC attributes for graphical elements on your page. 
*Include descriptive captions or other options for making graphical features accessible. 
*Provide alternatives for content in applets and plug-ins.
*Condensing text content &lt;br&gt;
*Spell-check and proof read &lt;br&gt;
*Locate and correct broken links &lt;br&gt;
*Include contact information and copyright notice &lt;br&gt;
*Provide contact information &lt;br&gt;
*Provide URL redirection when pages relocate &lt;br&gt; 
Test your Web site with a variety of Web browsers, and always test your pages with at least one text-based browser and with multi-media browsers with graphics and sound-loading features turned off. This way you will see your Web resources from the many perspectives of your users. Also, view the resources at your site using a variety of computing platforms, monitor sizes, and screen resolutions. Make sure you can access all of the features of your Web site with the keyboard alone, simulating the experience of Web users who cannot use a mouse. Make use of accessibility testing software such as A-Prompt, Bobby, and WAVE; they will point out elements that could be inaccessible. Then, revise your HTML to make your site accessible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Project Based Learning Definitions'''

The Buck Institute for Education (BIE)[http://www.bie.org] defines Project based learning (PBL) as &quot;a systematic teaching method that engages students in learning knowledge and skills through an extended inquiry process structured around complex, authentic questions and carefully designed products and tasks.&quot;[http://www.bie.org/pbl/pblhandbook/intro.php]

PBL is not a new idea.  It has roots that go back to the late 60's and 70's with open classroom theory and industrial education.  In this day and age where teachers need to teach multiple things at various levels, a project based approach makes sense for a majority of teachers.  PBL promotes ways to introduce a wider range of learning activities into a normal classroom setting.  If done correctly, learners will take on the responsibility of the learning and discover connections to other leaning opportunities around them.  PBL also takes into account the learners own background and uses their prior experiences to make the learning more concrete.  

'''PBL Benefits to Students'''

When PBL is used in the classroom it makes students switch from their usual mindset.  The students are presented with a real life problem to work through to solution.  Many times they are required to come up with a few plausible fixes for a problem and told to justify which one they find to be the best.  Students that go through this process come away with a more developed knowledge of subject matter, higher levels of confidence and greater technical and collaborative skills.   Studies have shown that students who complete a course enriched by using PBL are more likely to develop higher levels of critical thinking and problem solving skills than their traditional classroom setting counterparts.  Leadership and collaborative skills also seem to be higher when PBL lessons are used.  [http://www.thejournal.com/magazine/vault/A5162A.cfm]

According to the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory benefits of project-based instruction include:

*Preparing learners for the workplace by exposing them to competencies such as collaboration, project planning, decision making, and time management
*Teachers often see increased motivation through higher levels of attendance, participation, and homework
*Learners have greater collaborative opportunities to construct knowledge
*Increases in social and communication skills
*Learners are able to see connections between disciplines
*Increased problem-solving  skills
*Increased learner self-esteem
*Learners use individual learning strengths and diverse approaches to learning
*Provides real-world experiences to learn and use technology[http://www.nwrel.org/request/2002aug/benefits.html]


'''Criteria For PBL Programs'''

BIE published a list of distinguishing criteria of PBL.  It appears to be a pretty good list and points out what PBL should encompass.  Here is what BIE's list looks like:

*Put the students at the center of the learning process by recognizing their inherent “drive to learn.”
*The project work is central rather than peripheral
*Stress issues that lead students to in-depth exploration of topics
*Require the use of essential tools and skills, including technology, for learning, self management, and project management
*Specify products that solve problems, explain dilemmas, or present information generated through investigation and research.
*Include multiple products that permit feedback
*Use performance-based assessments that communicate high expectations, various skills, and rigorous challenges
*Encourage collaboration through large or small group student-led presentations and class project result evaluations
*A definite beginning, middle and end
*Real world problems [http://www.bie.org/pbl/pblhandbook/intro.php#standards]

A typical PBL project for high school students might be to design a future school.  In doing this, students would be introduced to various advanced math and engineering concepts.  An elementary project might consist of building and racing electric cars to learn lessons about energy and efficiency.  All projects should give students hands-on, serious, authentic experiences.

'''Using Multiple Intelligences in Project Based Learning'''

John Dewey theorized that learning should not only prepare one for life, but should also be an integral part of life itself. Simulating real problems and real problem-solving is one function of project-based learning. Students help choose their own projects and create learning opportunities based upon their individual interests and strengths. Projects assist students in succeeding within the classroom and beyond, because they allow learners to apply '''multiple intelligences'''  [http://www.multi-intell.com] in completing a project they can be proud of. Our society values individuals who can solve problems creatively, using multiple strengths, so why shouldn't we encourage students to do the same? 

However, traditional teaching strategies tend to focus on verbal/linguistic and mathematical/logical intelligences alone. This can create frustration for people who are comfortable with less traditional learning modalities, such as kinesthetic, visual, interpersonal, intrapersonal, musical, or naturalist. Project-based learning allows the teacher to incorporate numerous teaching and learning strategies into project planning and implementation. Assisting learners in developing all of their intelligences will make learning a part of living, not just a preparation for it.

'''The Role of Technology'''

Without computers PBL would be very different and much more difficult.  Learners use word processors and databases to help them categorize, analyze and keep track of data.  They use the internet, email and online forums for research, communication and collaboration with the outside world.  The collaboration element has probably the biggest benefit to any learner.  It allows them to talk to numerous experts about a variety of subjects.  If used correctly, then learners share information with each other and in doing this, further their own learning.  Without these technological advancements the learners working knowledge base would not be as plentiful.

Added, technology PBL can enhance the relevance of classroom projects, and foster multidisciplinary exploration, where various activities and subjects are explored and integrated in the project. For example, concepts from Maths, Fine Arts, and Physics can be applied to projects in architecture and design. The collaborative approach to designing PBL instruction can enhance motivation and achievement, as well as promote active learning and effective communication.

'''PBL Research'''

Regie Stites of SRI, International, wrote that researchers have investigated the impact of project-based learning (PBL) in a wide variety of educational contexts ranging from early childhood education to medical and legal education. [http://pblmm.k12.ca.us/PBLGuide/pblresch.htm]

Stites mentions that the points below &quot;should be kept in mind when considering the findings of research that compare the relative impacts of PBL and more traditional learning activities on student achievement&quot;: 

*Project-based learning is typically implemented in the context of comprehensive educational reforms and therefore it is difficult to isolate the effects of PBL on student learning.
*Project-based learning and closely related instructional strategies (such as problem-based learning and the project approach) are implemented differently in different contexts and therefore it is difficult to compare results across cases. 
*Project-based learning is linked to a theory of learning (constructivism) that entails a shift in learning objectives (stressing higher order thinking skills and performance-based, authentic assessments) and therefore standardized achievement tests may not be the best measures of PBL's impact.

The online magazine Edutopia [http://www.edutopia.org/] published an article in 2001 listing several of the studies that has been completed in the area of project-based learning. The studies in the article shows that PBL can improve students’ skills in the areas of communication, teamwork and problem solving and improve in core academic areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Instructional Design Based on Knowledge Objects'''''

Based on a chapter by Merrill in Reigeluth's Green Book.


== What is ITT ==

Merrill introduces the Instructional Transaction Theory (ITT) as an attempt to provide more precision to designing instruction for different kinds of instructional outcomes and also as an attempt to make automated instructional design possible. As a synthesis oriented theory, ITT emphasizes the integration of the components of Merrill’s Component Display Theory (CDT) into instructional transactions. An instructional transaction is all of the interactions necessary for a student to acquire a particular kind of knowledge or skill.

By describing instructional strategies as algorithms or transactions used for manipulating data structures or knowledge objects, Merill aims to provide a more precise description of the different kinds of instructional transactions required for different kinds of instructional outcomes. Building appropriate instructional transactions into instructional development tools will enable automating certain steps of the instructional design process and will increase efficiency. ITT extends Gagne's conditions of learning and Merrill's Component Display Theory so that the rules and principles involved are enough to drive automated instructional design – a computer-based system that creates instruction based on instructional parameters input by designers.

== Merrill's Instructional Transactions ==

An important element of ITT is called a knowledge object. Knowledge objects provide a way to represent knowledge and are used to build a set of transaction shells (instructional algorithms) to teach it (Merrill, 1996; Merrill, 2000). The transaction shells consist of rules for selecting and sequencing knowledge objects. ITT integrates these components into instructional transactions which are made up of all the interactions necessary to acquire a particular kind of knowledge or skill.

Merrill presents instructional goals for the IDENTIFY, EXECUTE, and INTERPRET transactions (the first three of his 13 instructional classes). The referenced example is an open-ended learning environment designed to teach technicians how to install or remove a double seat valve in a pipe. Merrill describes the learning environment in terms of the instructional goal it is designed to promote, the knowledge structure required by the learning environment, the general simulation engine which operates on this knowledge structure, and the learning activity of exploration. He also describes the three instructional transactions of IDENTIFY, EXECUTE, and INTERPRET. For each transaction, the instructional goal, the knowledge structure, the presentation of information to the student, the practice with feedback, and the learner guidance are presented. 

The component methods of ITT illustrate a possible increase of precision with which instructional strategies can be described in the form of knowledge objects. The instructional strategies can be described as methods for manipulating the elements of knowledge objects. They enable the specification of executable knowledge, that is, they enable both tutorial and experiential instruction from the same knowledge representation.

== Personal Reflections on ITT ==

I believe that Instructional Transaction Theory (ITT) has enormous potential, but I am convinced that it is a method that can only be leveraged by the use of technology. A little while ago, I attempted what I thought would be a modest project using ITT. I decided to develop a blueprint for how I could teach my students to troubleshoot computer printers and printer problems in the High School computer lab. However, the many “what if” scenarios quickly became overwhelming... so many conditions, so many combinations leading to different outcomes, so many different kinds of printers. Even if I had fully developed the architecture or blueprint, it would have been so complex that no one could have used it without the help of technology. In the end, I realized that computers are much more adept than people at keeping track of the large volume of properties and conditions and running and remembering all the “what if” calculations.

I know that there are object-based, database-driven websites out there that have thousands of knowledge objects, and I know that there has been work done by the Army on how the Army can develop an object-based, “chunky” system for writing and publishing instructional doctrine. ITT makes perfect sense to me, and I think that ITT could transform instruction and instructional design. 

When knowledge objects and database structures finally become standardized, we will possess the potential to have reusable, updatable components of instruction that move at the speed of the Internet. And, if instructional designers would share and allow their work to be treated as “objects” that are publicly available, then it would seem easy to generate personalized, adaptive instruction in a relatively short period of time and at minimal cost. However, there is still a lot of research and practice necessary to enable automating certain steps of the instructional design process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Web Accessibility for Disabilities ==

&quot;Accessible Design&quot; calls for design that includes the needs of people whose physical, mental, or environmental conditions limit their performance. &quot;[[Instructional Technology/Learning Management Systems/Universal Design|Universal Design]]&quot; aims to extend standard design principles to include people of all ages and abilities, but remains at the level of generality—so does not address all the specific needs of any particular disability. 

But even for people who do not have any specific physical or mental characteristics that affect computer use, it has been found that adopting universal design principles can reduce fatigue, increase speed, decrease errors, and decrease learning time for all users. In many ways, universal design addresses the larger issues of usability making things easier for everyone. 

General Principles
*Allow for Flexibility 
*Provide choices in features and ways that tasks can be accomplished 
*Accommodate right- and left-handed use 
*Allow the user to customize settings whenever possible 
*Keep in mind that people may be using adaptive technologies 
Be Simple and Intuitive 
*Do not design something differently from user expectations just to be different 
*Eliminate unnecessary complexity 
*Provide feedback 
Minimize Errors 
*Provide warnings 
*Build fail-safe features when possible 
*Do not establish patterns when you want people to pay attention 
*Redundancy provides flexibility for different user preferences, system configurations, or user abilities. This can be accomplished by using more than one way to represent, display, and enter data, such as: 
**using both a beep and a menu bar flash to notify a user of an error using text to label images 
**redundantly allowing a user to issue commands by typing or selecting something with a pointer 
Avoid Side Effects
*Side effects should be avoided because they cause particular problems for novice users and disabled users who may have difficulty detecting or correcting certain types of side effects.

''Beekeeping'' is being designed as an all-purpose broad scope reference book pertaining to apiculture, including information regarding bees, beekeeping and associated practices. Although ''Beekeeping'' is being written with the initial intent in aiding hobbyist, it is a growing resource that could also aid commercial beekeepers similarly. This Wiki book however, is not being written in a completely linear manner. Because of the writing style of this book, through the act of simply reading it chapter-by-chapter content will be lost. Reading in this manner should still prove to be worthwhile, but more topics and greater depth may be uncovered by following links within the text.
Much like other Wiki based texts, ''Beekeeping'' is dependant on the collaborative effort of the community. If you have read your fill of this book and have some extra information that you can add, we request you do so, but before submitting please visit the [[Beekeeping/Editing Guide| Editing Guidelines and Information]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Request for Help==
'''Beekeeping''' is designed as a collaborative book based on beekeeping and apiary practices. It exists as a guide to both beginners and experts alike. However if there are any experts in the audience we ask that you donate some of your time to help this project out by submitting some text or media. Every additional amount of text is helpful, whether it be a simply adding missing punctuation or the addition of great body of text. This book cannot evolve on its own; it requires your help. Please don’t be discouraged even if you are not an expert; if you have something to add then please do so.  Any help is appreciated.

==Submitting Text==
Articles can be submitted in the same manner as any other Wiki submission, with one minor difference. Article links must be formed with a prefix of “Beekeeping” followed by a slash “/”. In example to submit a link about beekeeping fashion you must do the following
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Beekeeping/Fashion|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Linking is done similarly to that of Namespace linking, in essence Beekeeping functions similarly to a namespace while not actually being one.

For a general reference guide of editing Wiki pages visit the [[Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|How_to_edit_a_page]] page.

==New Book==
'''Beekeeping''' is a new book.  Because of this you will see a rather copious amount of red text, please help us by adding a missing article.

==If It’s Missing Add It==
If at any time you see that an article is missing, feel free to add it or add a request for it. Occasionally subjects can be overlooked and may not be added, other times no one has simply taken the time to add one, take the initiative and do so.

==Stand Back and Take a Bow==
If you have submitted anything to '''Beekeeping''' please add your name and any comments you might have to the [[Beekeeping/Contributors| Contributors]] list. Any added info you can relay in regards to your experience or background with bees would be an added plus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}

==Faraday's Law==

In 1831, Faraday discovered the following three phenomena:
:1. If a coil of wire is pulled across a magnetic field, a current is induced.
:2. When a magnet is moved, a current is also induced.
:3. When the strength of the magnetic field is changed, a current is induced.

It is easy to understand the first phenomena. We know that a coil of wire has free electrons inside. When the current is moved, these charges are in motion, so a magnetic force will cause them to move, creating a current.

Of course, we would immediately recognize that phenomena 1 would imply phenomena 2 by the relativity principle. However, its explanation in classical mechanics is less straightfoward. Clearly, since the wire isn't moving, there is no magnetic force (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_B=q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, it must be the ''electric'' field creating the current. Somehow, a changing magnetic field must ''induce'' an electric field.

It turns out that the induced emf in all 3 cases is given by &lt;math&gt;\xi=- \frac{\partial\Phi_B}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic flux. Most people would call this Faraday's Law, but this equation really encompasses two physical laws: the Lorentz Force Law, and the induction of electric fields. IT is a miracle the same equation would describe two different phenomena.

The direction of the induced current is given by Lenz's Law, which states that the induced current will try to ''oppose'' the change in flux. This explains the negative sign in Faraday's equation. Lenz's Law is necessary for the Law of Conservation of Energy to hold. 

Consider a metal plate falling through a space between two magnets. As it is falling, the magnetic flux would change, giving rise to a induced current, also known as an ''eddy current''. Lenz's Law tells us that this current will oppose the change in flux, and so the magnetic force would act upwards on the plate. Thus, its velocity will slow. This application is used to damp pendulums, and is important enough to be considered for motor design.


== How Generators Work ==

In an electric generator, a coil of wires rotates in a magnetic field. As the wire rotates, the flux changes, and so a current is induced.

Suppose the coil has n turns. Then the induced potential is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\xi= - N \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

By Lenz's Law, this current flow in such a way so that it will oppose the changes in flux. Thus, if there were no external forces, the coil's rotation rate would slow down and eventually stop. This makes sense, for the current we induced carry energy, and because energy is conserved, the coil's rotation energy must decrease. Thus, a generator needs an external force to turn the coil of wires.

=== Real Generators ===

Real generators generally spin a large magnet inside a Coil, in Australia we use three phase generators, meaning that there are in fact three coils, at 120 degree spacings. These generators produce voltages in the thousands. They are powered by sources such as coal, oil, and hydoelectric. In some countries Nuclear Fission is used to produce steam which turns turbines.

== More on Faraday's Law ==

Let us try to relate the emf with the electric field. As the electric field moves a charge down the wire, it does work &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt; per unit charge. The total work per unit charge it does in moving the charge through the wire must be the emf, so  
:&lt;math&gt;\xi=\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt;

The law of fluxes would then be:
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -{d\Phi \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;


You might object, saying that the integral of an electric field along a closed path is always 0, or that the electric field is conservative, but that is only true for electro''static'' fields. Induced electric fields are never conservative, and there is no way of defining a potential energy for induced electric fields. &lt;math&gt;E=-\nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes false.

Faraday's Law is considered one of Maxwell's Equations. 

We can write it in its differential form by noting that &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}=\int_{A} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} \mathbf{E} \cdot ds=\int_{A} (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}=\int_{A} -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== External links ==

Hi and thanks for your contributions.  However Wikibooks is intended to be &quot;read&quot; in a standalone fashion and therefore content is what is required rather than weblinks.  This would be the case even if the page had quite a lot of text and certainly pages which merely contain links are unacceptable to us and so have been deleted. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

The '''grape''' is a popular small [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]].
Dried grapes are called [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]].
Grapes are commonly used to make [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]], and [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

Half of the world's fruit production goes to grapes. Most grapes are used for production of foods marketed as being without added [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. For this use, the juice is treated to remove the flavor and pretty much everything else except for the sugar and water.

Though not always, flavor can usually be guessed by color and size. Very large grapes tend to have a weak flavor. Green grapes also tend to have a weak flavor. Red grapes tend to have a fairly full flavor. Purple grapes tend to have the flavor of red grapes plus a sort of harsh bitter taste. Grapes with seeds tend to have better flavor than grapes without seeds.

Grapes are not normally cooked, except to demonstrate odd properties of a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]].
Cut the grape nearly in half, leaving a very thin connection. Place the grape in the microwave oven with the cut sides up. Microwave the grape.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lots of POV here. Let's make it more neutral.
[said by 137.222.40.132, so I can't easily respond]

:I'm not so sure you improved things.

:While organic food is a dream come true for corporate marketing, it isn't really a scam. Well, not more than anything else being pushed these days. You do get what you pay for. Just realize that you're ''not'' avoiding big agriculture corporations. They love having a premium price product to get some extra profit out of people with money to burn.
:: Organic food IS often a scam. Most large-scale producers take the minimum amount of measures necessary to receive organic certification, ie. not very many. They are very good at finding loopholes. In many cases they simply stick the organic label on the food they would have sold as non-organic and triple the price. [[User:137.222.40.132|137.222.40.132]] 18:33, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::: To me, &quot;scam&quot; implies that you are being cheated. You are not cheated. Of course, you should not expect the producer to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. You might argue that the requirements are too loose of course, but AFAIK they are being met. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:39, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:The &quot;''Because organic food commands a high price, it is often treated better than non-organic food.''&quot; paragraph is not really an argument against organic food. You only see it that way because of your viewpoint. The paragraph argues for both sides. If you buy food for taste, you ''want'' it packed in foam and shipped by air.
:: It's not my viewpoint. It was only suggested by the previous negative tone of the article. [[User:137.222.40.132|137.222.40.132]] 18:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Where do you get the idea that &quot;''Organically farmed animals generally receive more welfare''&quot;? I suspect that this is a hope you have. More than anything else, corporate marketing is about image. 
::What does corporate marketing have to do with animal welfare? Certification by the [http://www.soilassociation.org/ soil association] for instance requires higher standards of  animal welfare than government regulations. That's a fact, not a hope. [[User:137.222.40.132|137.222.40.132]] 18:33, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::What does a soilassociation certification have to do with &quot;organic&quot; products? At least in the USA, I'm pretty sure the FDA and USDA won't care. You can market something as organic with or without soilassociation certification. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:39, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:What do you mean that &quot;''Organic farming methods often discourage monoculture and its impact on species diversity.''&quot;? Everybody sane does crop rotation. Nobody can afford to grow things the old way, with beans growing up corn stalks and squash to provide weed control. In any case, species diversity of farming pests is not exactly a good thing.
::As you have mentioned before, you get what you pay for.
:::Sure, but ''nobody'' pays to have beans growing up cornstalks with squash all around. Normal &quot;organic&quot; produce comes from rather ordinary fields. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:39, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Alcoholic drinks''' are frequently used as [[Cookbook:Ingredients|ingredients]] in [[Cookbook:Recipes|recipes]]. This page lists the most common types used as ingredients. See the [[Bartending]] book for mixed drink recipes and other topics relating to direct uncooked consumption of alcoholic drinks.

Small amounts of alcohol can be useful for cardiovascular reasons and blood sugar. Harvard says &quot;For men, a good balance point is 1 to 2 drinks a day. For women, it's at most one drink a day.&quot; The USDA agrees, while also stating that women of childbearing age who are planning to become pregnant should completely avoid alcohol. Also, since ethyl alcohol turns to sugar in the bloodstream, it helps regulate blood sugar. See the warnings listed below though, while being aware that many people have difficulty keeping consumption moderate.

Refer to the wikipedia [[w:Effects of alcohol on the body|article]] for additional information but ultimately [[Wikibooks:Medical disclaimer|consult your doctor]] on health issues.

==[[Cookbook:Beer|Beer]]==
Beer is any variety of alcoholic drink produced by the brewing process: fermentation of starchy material derived from grains or other plant sources, such as malted barley or wheat. Beer typically has an alcoholic strength of from 3 to 8 percent.  However, certain Belgian and independent craft brewers produce beers with alcoholic strengths in excess of 8%, with 12 % not being uncommon for these styles.

==[[Cookbook:Cider|Cider]]==
Throughout most of the World cider is the fermented juice of apples (there are special cultivars used for cider making). In the USA cider normally refers to unfiltered unfermented apple juice and the alcoholic variety is known as &quot;hard cider&quot;. Cider, like beer, typically has an alcoholic strength of from 3 to 8 percent.

==[[Cookbook:Perry|Perry]]==

Perry or pear cider is an alcoholic beverage made of fermented pear juice. It is similar to cider, in that it is made using a similar process and often has a similar alcoholic content, up to 8.5% alcohol by volume.

==[[Cookbook:Wine|Wine]]==
Wine usually has an alcohol content of between 10 and 15 percent, and is made by fermentation of [[Cookbook:Grape|grape]] juice. [[w:Fruit wine|Fruit wine]]s are wine-like beverages made from fruits other than grapes. Fortified wine such as port and sherry is made by adding brandy to wine, increasing the strength to around 20 percent.

==[[Cookbook:Mead|Mead]]==
Mead is an alcoholic beverage made of honey, water, and yeast. It is roughly of the same alcoholic strength as wine, and is sometimes known as &quot;honey wine&quot;. Before import of grape wine became economical, mead was very popular in Northern Europe, including the British Isles, Poland and Scandinavia. In Viking Age Scandinavia, mead was considered to inspire skaldic poetry. Mead is probably also the origin of the word ''honeymoon'' as the father of the bride was said to give as a dowry a month's supply of the liquor.

==[[Cookbook:Spirits|Spirits]]==
The term '''spirits''' includes brandy, cognac, rum, vodka, gin, vermouth, and whisky; other spirits are not widely used in cooking. These are made by distilling weaker drinks to concentrate the alcohol content to 35 percent or more. Spirits are often used in dramatic formal flambe [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]], where a very high concentration of alcohol is required to allow ignition.

==Warnings==

Excessive consumption of alcohol may cause loss of social inhibition, vomiting, and a [[w:Hangover|hangover]]. In extreme cases, alcohol poisoning may occur, which can be fatal. It is known that excessive use for a prolonged period of time can cause liver diseases like cirrhosis, and may even alter brain functions.

Intoxicated people should not operate heavy machinery, including automobiles. Pregnant women should avoid alcoholic beverages, to prevent damage to the fetus ([[w:Fetal Alcohol Syndrome|Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]]).

Alcohol addiction ([[w:Alcoholism|alcoholism]]) can lead to weight gain and [[w:Cirrhosis|liver disease]].

Consumption is submitted to extensive regulation in most countries. In particular, a person not of legal drinking age who consumes alcohol may face legal troubles (along with their guardians, and/or those responsible for supplying the alcohol).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classification of beers ==

People are often confused about types of beer (i.e. ale vs. lager vs. stout, etc).  Let me first say that &quot;Beer&quot; doesn't belong as a type of beer.  All beer is beer.

'''All''' beer is either an ''ale'' or a ''lager''.  The distinction has to do with the type of yeast used.  As a rule of thumb (but only that -- there are exceptions), ale yeast ferments quickly at high temperatures and floats on top during fermentation, while lager yeast ferments at more slowly at low temperatures and stays on the bottom of the fermenting vessel.  This is somewhat confused by the fact that the process of fermenting beer at low temperatures is called ''lagering'', quite apart from what yeast is used.  A homebrewer can easiler  lager an ale (i.e. use ale yeast but ferment a lager temperatures) or ferment a lager at ale temperatures.  This is quite rare AFAIK in the commercial beer world -- Anchor Steam is an example of the latter.  But it's still technically a lager.

Beer is divided into styles.  See, for example, [http://www.mv.com/ipusers/slack/bjcp/style-index.html the BJCP Style Guide].  Ale and lager are not styles.  Stouts, for example, are ales.  And there are many types of stout.

In short, the all to common Ale vs. Lager is not useful in describing beer.  It's kinda like saying the types of cars are &quot;two door&quot; and &quot;four door&quot;.  True, but it's more an either-or attribute of being a car.  Talking about &quot;Coupes&quot;, &quot;Sedans&quot;, &quot;wagons&quot;, &quot;minivans&quot;, etc. is a better top-level organization.  While being four- or two- door is perhaps common or universally found in some styles and not others, it's not really a good top-level organization in exactly the same way ales and lagers are not good top level categories for beer.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:129.46.148.232|129.46.148.232]] ([[User talk:129.46.148.232|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/129.46.148.232|contribs]]) 01:04, 1 November 2005 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;

Alright so I've sort of taken it upon myself to fix up this page.  I agree that this shouldn't strive to be just another dictionary. (at least not at this point)  Right now I'm adding some instruction.  You can't learn a language with just a dictionary, although it's kind of hard without it.  I'm gonna email a few people who run online ASL dictionaries and see if I can link directly to their definitions. (or maybe they'll even let us put some stuff of this site, who knows?) Any help would be greatly appreciated. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 07:04, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Hi, I'm working on the French Sign Language wikibook.  I think this is a unique opportunity to build something really different -- not just a dictionary, but an actual manual of ASL (or LSF in my case).  In case you are geographically close enough to talk to anybody who could donate material, I've made a demo of the LSF wiki that you can transport on laptop.  This is useful for showing people directly exactly what we're trying to do, and really driving home the point that we're not trying to just build a dictionary.  If you want, I can send you the zip file.  Otherwise, if you have any other ideas on how we could collaborate, please let me know.  Cheers, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:52, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:Another note: videos on wikimedia projects have to be in the (free) ogg theora format.  I might be of some tech assistance on that end.  If you are a programmer, we might be able to work together to produce a user friendly video converter so that more people can get their ASL stuff online -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Alright! I can't believe someone is actually interested in helping me out on this.  I figured the popularity of sign language would be minimal to say the least.  Go ahead and email me the zip at genericdave AT hotmail.com (just be sure to post here once you have so I know to check it)  I would love to see your ideas.  As for the video stuff we could theoretically tape the stuff ourselves but I'd like to venture a few other directions first.  --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 23:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Sent.  Sorry it took me so long; I had to package it a bit more nicely than I had.  If anyone else is interested, contact me on my user page. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:41, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

::Oh, and I'd also like to suggest that instead of videos we could possibly use animated images (are gifs allowed on wikipedia?)  --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 23:50, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Worth considering.  Do you mean animated drawings? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:41, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

::::I mean basic picture animations so visitors will not have to have any sort of fancy plugins to view the pictures in site.  You can also check out how [http://www.lifeprint.com/ this guy] does it.  Getting any sort of dictionary up would be quite the undertaking.  We might be able to convince one of the owners of the other online dictionaries to let us link to some of their stuff for words that we use in examples and such.  Then again, there's no hurry to get this done or anything, and it's not like there's a big demand, so I see no reason why such a colossal undertaking should be ruled out.  By the way, I looked at the zip you sent me, good stuff.  I'll see about actually getting some information up before I worry about structure though.  I have a ASL midterm coming up here so I probably won't update much for a little while. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 11:19, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

=== Animations continued... ===

Interesting.  Commons *does* seem accept gif images, so it'd be an interesting thing to try out.  I have some doubts -- it might be very large and it might be too choppy to be useful -- but the only way to know for sure is to try it out.  

Otherwise, I think that the picture-strip format (i.e. the lifeprint approach you showed me) is a good complement to regular video.  Video for people who want to see the sign in motion (rhythm, etc).  Picture strip for those who want to get an idea at a glance (no need to keep going back and forth) or to print things out.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:08, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah you've got the basic idea.  I just hate sites that force people to install particular software in order to view anything.  I guess it would be pretty cool to have multiple kinds of examples in the dictionary.  Oh yeah and by the way, sorry if I'm slow on updating for the next few weeks.  Quarter's coming to an end here and school has a way of sneaking up on ya.  Like I said I'm planning on doing this but it's gonna be slow. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 02:38, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

::I understand :-) that's one of the things I like about this project.  It's impressive to see what people can do with the precious spare time they have.  I also understand the point about forcing people to install particular software.  But that's related to the reason why we are using the Ogg Theora format (see [[meta:Video policy]]).  It's the only free format around, the only thing that prevents us from being at the mercy of any one vendor.  Only problem is that it's very much a minority in the real world, hence the &quot;special&quot; software.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:00, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== GordKnot ==

Hey guys.  I don't know ASL, but I'm hoping to begin studying this summer.  Very glad to see this book getting some attention; as you stated above, there are many dictionaries online, but no lexicons and no grammars.  If you want any help on the technical end (converting or editing video, etc), let me know.  Also, I cue a bit (slowly - still working on that); would it be appropriate to put a page on CS in here, just as a &quot;here's one alternative that some Deaf use&quot;?  I don't have a Wiki account, but you can email me at gordknot@gmail.com -- GordKnot 19:35 10 December 2005 (UTC)

:Hey, welcome to the project!  You might consider creating an account so that we can interact more easily.    It's pretty painless: name, password, password (verification) and click the &quot;Create New Account&quot; button.  Here are some ideas on how to help the project along:
:* Can you do any computer programming? -- it would be great if we could make it easier for non-technical users to get their video into ogg format.  If we could have a graphical utility, or somehow integrate an anything-to-ogg converter into the wikipedia uploader, it would seriously move the project along.
:* Do you know anybody who teaches ASL?  See if you can get them to participate in the project, and/or donate course materials to the site.  I have a demonstrator that you can [http://eric.kow.free.fr/download/LSFwikiDemo.zip download] and carry around on a laptop.  It might be a useful way to show people what we're trying to accomplish.  
:Also, I think a &lt;s&gt;page of&lt;/s&gt; wikibook on cued speech would be very useful.  You might stir up some political issues, but wikimedia projects are very used to handling controversy, so we'll be ok :-) Please feel free to dive right in, put whatever content you think would be useful, change things, and generally be bold.  It's what makes this project work. Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:03, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

''Rather than composing another online American Sign Language (ASL) Dictionary, the goal of this page is to be a resource of various online ASL Dictionaries''
:Aw come on, we can do better than that! (N.B. I'm not an ASL speaker).  One thing I've always found frustrating about ASL books I see in the stores is that they almost always consist of dictionaries.  What about grammar?  How about we try to fill the gap?  Provide something that teaches people how to speak ASL, beyond a list of words, but how to manipulating things like Classifiers, Role, etc?  Check out the French Sign Language book (http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/LSF).  We in the LSF wiki community haven't had time to put anything really substantial together, but at least we're aiming high, and hopefully, little by little, we'll get there.  Don't you think there's room for collaboration on some real, '''useful''' sign language resources? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:47, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)


There's a lot more to ASL than simply knowing the signs.  Sentences are not formed the same way they are in American English.  I might take the time to add a bit of info about how to put the signs together at a later date. -- [[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]]

:Alright that's it.  I'm gonna completely revamp this thing.  I'm not gonna attempt another online dictionary (at least not at this point) but I'll definitely add some grammatical stuff. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 23:14, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[WB:WIW]] ==

ASL dictionaries and directories of websites are '''[[WB:WIN|not]]''' acceptable content. I've started an outline, and transwikied some content from Wikipedia. I hope to contribute more, but reverting to any of these previous conceptions of what the book might be would likely result in deletion.

== Infants and toddlers ==

I suggest a book about [[w:Sign language in infants and toddlers|Sign language in infants and toddlers]] --[[Special:Contributions/193.145.201.52|193.145.201.52]] ([[User talk:193.145.201.52|talk]]) 10:32, 14 October 2008 (UTC)

== Formating and making this book a book ==

If someone wants to work on the transwiki stuff I can help out with the formating. Also the pages need to be more book like. The idea is that this is going to be a pdf file and a text book for people to learn from. Pictures are fine but lets not have anything that moves around and can't be printed, eh?
We can put the moving stuff on wikimedia or something.
:Why would you avoid using video? Wikibooks isn't paper (luckily). I'd be happy to perform imports as needed - just let me know what's needed. Besides that, I can help with organization. However, I'm not able to take on much of an author role at the moment. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:17, 4 January 2009 (UTC)

== To Do ==

Pasted from the front page of this wikibook:
*[[/Grammar 1/]] is a de-wikified version of [[w:American Sign Language grammar]] which needs to be split up into the various grammar lessons.
*[[Transwiki:American Sign Language]] needs to be split into multiple modules: [[/History/]], [[/Simple Sentences 1/]]...
*[[Transwiki:Deaf culture]] needs to be split into multiple modules [[/Deaf Culture/]], [[/History/]], [[/Dialogue 1/]]...
*[[Transwiki:Bimodal bilingualism]] needs to be split into [[/Deaf Culture/]], [[/History/]].
*[[Transwiki:Deafness#Children of deaf adults]] can be merged into [[/Deaf Culture/]].
*[[Transwiki:Profanity in American sign language]] can be added towards the end of the book and reworked as a lesson.
*[[Transwiki:Two-handed manual alphabet]] can be added as an advanced lesson regarding combined hearing-vision impairments

If there are no protests, I would like to start a '''[[American Sign Language/Under Development|sandbox]]''' of sorts to develop a different approach for this wikibook. It will be a slow process, as I would like to gather images and make the lesson plans balance grammar learning with vocabulary introduction, and exercises. Help would be greatly appreciated, as my knowledge of ASL is basic at the moment. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 06:09, 27 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

x add Wikipedia links to radio stations

o add info about text-to-speech and links to comparisons and software (can also convert text and playback on MP3 plyaer for some software)

== Add INA website ==

Michael Foster noted:

Professor Cziko &amp; John:

The French website to which you alluded is the site for the National Audiovisual Institute in France that opened up its archives and released around 100,000 film, tv and radio clips for public use. Their website is:

http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php

I haven't used it for class yet, but there are lots of interesting historical and cultural documents that can make class and research more interesting.



== Spanish podcasts ==

Janet said:

I have just began listening to podcasts in Spanish and it is a great way to improve listening skills and understanding! I definitely am going to start using this resource on a more regular basis.  In addition, I like how I can subscribe to a podcast and then have itunes automatically download the most recent podcasts; that way, I don't have to worry about tuning in to a specific radio show at a specific time, for example, because podcasts are available at all times of the day.  Recently, I have been listening to ABC news in Spanish which I definitely reccomend because it is a great resource for staying in tune to what's going on in the world, and the announcer does not speak very fast so it is easier to understand.  Hopefully other learners find this helpful!

== English podcasts ==

Jing said:
For me, listening has been the most difficult part when learning English. During the days preparing for my TOEFL test,I found some useful on-line radio website whhich was really helpful for me.

Earth and Sky
http://www.earthsky.org/shows/
It provides numerous information relating to science and nature by interviewing with scientists each day. EFL learners can listen to every topic they are interested in by clicking the specific date. Moreover, each topic has complete script and related link on-line.

Also, it you found science is boring and too advanced, you can use this website, which was designed for learners of different levels. It is quite helpful for me on listening skill.

http://www.esl-lab.com/
It includes various conversation topics of our daily life. For me, when I feel that the content is more familiar with me, I can understand the context easier.
Also, it has vocabulary quizz followed by each conversation, vocabulary learning tips, and long conversation with realy video. And if you want to prepare for the TOEFL test, it has academic lecture, too.

I haven't tried podcast before. In fact, it's my first time hear about podcast. Maybe I will find more useful resourse there by the end of this course.

Need to add blogs and blog directories for finding blogs in different languages. Technorati is one blog search engine/directory. Google and Yahoo can also find blogs, but do they find them in non-English languages, too?

Here is a directory of Francophone blogs: http://www.annuaireblog.org/

== Google in searches in selected languages and countries ==

It is possible to use the Google search engine restricted to a selected language or to sites from a particuar country. Usually you add the country code after google, so that, for example, google.fr give you the French Google. Some codes that work for Google are:
*France http://google.fr
*German http://google.de
*Switerzland http://google.ch
*Canada http://google.ca
*Spain http://google.es


I suppose there are many others and there must be a directory of these somewhere.

{{wikipedia}}
'''Apprentice carpenters''' are paid trainees who are learning to construct and repair structures of wood, plywood, and wallboard. They attend formal classes and work under experienced carpenters on the job to learn their craft. Carpenters work on residential as well as commercial buildings. 

Once the apprenticeship is complete, the person gains the title of journey person and can begin searching for work for themselves.

'''Duties:''' As residential or construction carpenters, apprentices may perform some or all of these basic duties: 

* Read plans, blueprints, or instructions 
* Identify and find materials 
* Determine size/shape of the required parts 
* Measure and mark materials for cutting 
* Cut and shape materials using hand or power tools 
* Erect forms, wood framework, sub-flooring, sheeting, partitions, floor joists, studding, and rafters 
* Install trim, wood paneling, cabinets, windows, doors, hardware, and flooring 
* Check accuracy with levels, rules, plumb bobs, and framing squares and make any necessary adjustments

The carpenter who builds commercial buildings usually builds forms and places structural steel in forms. Commercial building carpenters also do many activities similar to those of residential carpenters. 

'''Working Conditions:''' The normal work week for an apprentice carpenter is 40 hours. As in other building trades, carpentry requires prolonged standing, climbing, bending, and kneeling. The job may be indoors or outdoors, at floor level, or on ladders or scaffolding. Carpenters employed outside the construction industry may perform a variety of installation and maintenance work.

'''Wages:''' The typical apprentice earns around 50%-70% of the standard wages for a journey-person. Apprentice wages increase as the person gains more experience.

== Carpentry Projects==
Woodworking plans for constructing cabinets, chairs, shelves, and other objects typically created by carpenters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Thermodynamics|next=Thermodynamics/Enthalpy}}

Thermodynamics is the study of the changes in energy that occur in reactions.

==Systems==
A '''system''' is the set of substances and energy that is being studied.  If, for example, reactions are occurring in a jar, everything inside the jar is the system, and everything outside the jar is the '''surroundings'''.  The surroundings are everything not in the system, which means the rest of the universe. The system and the surroundings together are called the &quot;universe&quot;.

One important issue is what kind of interactions exist between the system and its surroundings. Some systems may exchange matter and heat with the surroundings (like a system of boiling liquid losing matter and heat with the vapor). This is called an '''open system'''.  If there is just heat exchange occurring between the system and its surroundings it is called a '''closed system'''.  No matter can enter or leave a closed system.  And, finally, if there is no exchange of heat and no exchange of matter, the system is completely '''isolated'''.

==Temperature vs. Heat==
If you put a hot iron pot under cold water, it cools down very quickly. This is because iron has a low '''specific heat''', which is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius (or Kelvin). Solid iron only requires 0.45 J/(g*K), while liquid water holds about nine times as much energy (heat) per degree (temperature). So when water receives energy from the pot, it only warms up by a few degrees, while the pot cools down substantially.

{{Yellow Warning|'''Temperature''' is the measure of the kinetic energy of a particle. '''Heat''' is energy, measured in joules (J).  There is a very big difference between the two.}}

==Thermochemical Equations==
Equations don't just show chemicals; they also show how much energy is required or released. This energy is called '''enthalpy'''. There are two ways to write a thermochemical reaction, for example:

*&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + 571.6\ kJ&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \quad (\Delta H = -285.8~kJ)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the number is negative in the second format. Also, notice how the first equation has double the energy because there are two moles of water.  The second equation shows the amount of heat ''per mole'', so the number of moles does not affect it.

From a thermochemical reaction, one can tell the '''molar heat of formation''' of a compound. Usually, this is measured at 25°C, and is written as ΔH&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;°. It is the amount of heat required to make one mole of the substance.  The small ° symbol means &quot;standard&quot;, as in Standard Temperature and Pressure.

'''Molar heat of combustion''' is the opposite of the molar heat of formation. It measures the amount of energy released when a mole of the compound is burned. It is written as ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;°.

{{Info|In thermochemistry, if a reaction takes multiple steps, the heats from each reaction are simply added or subtracted. This is known as '''Hess's Law'''.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pencils ==
There are various grades of pencils.  In a range of soft 8B to very hard 9H.

* Dark, heavy lines are drawn with High &quot;B&quot; numbered pencils.
* Fine, light lines are drawn with High &quot;H&quot; numbered pencils.
* F and HB are in the middle range.
* General usage is HB, F or 2H in carpentry.

== Chalk Line ==
Chalk line tools are used to mark straight lines, generally over long distances.  A chalk line may also be referred to as a &quot;chalk box&quot;, as this is also descriptive of the hand tools!

===Description===
Most chalk line tools consist of a string, usually with a hook on one end, that is wound around a spindle that is inside a box or container that contains powdered chalk of various colors.  Colors of chalk that are generally available, but not limited to, are blue (most common), red, yellow and orange.

===Use===
To use a chalk line, the free end of the string (usually with a hook) is pulled from the box.  The free end is then either hooked onto an object, such as the edge of a board or a nail, or is held by an assistant.  The container end of the chalk line is then taken to the other end of the object to be marked.  Both ends of the string are then placed over pre-measured marks and pulled taut.  The string is pulled away from the object to be marked and released, transferring a chalk line from the string to the object.  This may be repeated several times to mark additional lines before the string must be returned to the box to have additional chalk applied to it.  Note that care must be taken when snapping lines - if the stringline is pulled away in a direction not perpendicular to the face of the object, the snapped line will curve. Also, snapping across a hump or dip may cause distortions in the desired line. Snapping lines in wet weather can be problematic. In the worst conditions you can replace the cotton line with twisted nylon of the same dimension and then use concrete dye (powder) instead of chalk, adding water to the box,mixing and draining excess. Then flick excess dye from string before snapping and quickly lifting the line from the surface. Puddles should be swept away before using this method.

==Scratch Awl==

===Description===
A scratch awl is basically a strong metal pointer with a handle.

===Use===

A scratch awl is used for marking on materials which do not readily take pencil or chalk marks.  A line is scratched into the material with the awl.  

Another common use is to make a small indentation in wood, etc. into which a nail or screw is placed, or a drill bit aligned prior to predrilling a properly aimed hole for the nail or screw.  To make the biggest indentation in the least time:
# push awl-point straight down against the surface
# wiggle it to and fro in one direction
# wiggle it rotary-wise
# repeat the last two steps in sequence a time or two as needed.

====With wired-cardboard crafts====

When boxes are to be repaired or signs or other structures built by wiring together sections of cardboard, one may use the awl to create holes at the right positions on fitting pieces of cardboard prior to placing them together, or match the pieces together first and while holding or clamping them tightly together, make the first holes (often two) just prior to inserting and twist-tying wires to a desired secure tightness.

====Solid core telephone wire====
The type of wire most easily used is the kind found in telephone cables since World War II, with a solid copper wire inside any of ten colors of plastic sheathing which brings the outer diameter to about 1-mm.  This wire, sometimes in cables of 50 or 100, may be found discarded in dumpsters when business buildings are demolished, or intercepted on the way to a &quot;recycler&quot; (they only trash the plastic and melt down the copper for recasting at the cost of energy; an effort should be made to save this fine crafts resource, placing reuse ahead of &quot;recycling&quot;). 

====Multi-awl====
This tool is made by wirebraiding a big 2&quot; safety pin, by its foothole, to the handle of a regular awl.  Use this pin to make holes in tough cardboard, large enough to admit one telephone wire, or to start holes which are then easily widened by the regular awl point, usually wide enough to admit four telephone wires or one conduit-size wire (3-mm.).

===Liquid marker===
This is usually the easiest tool for marking pieces of carpentry wood and other varied materials.  The Sanford Sharpie and its million Asiatic imitators have a point of about the right sharpness for marking where cuts will be made, a support bar placed, etc.  Where many holes are due to be drilled, one may carefully mark all the locations first with a Sharpie, then dig pilot pits with an awl, then drill all the holes.

'''Gravy''' is a [[Cookbook:sauce|sauce]] made from the rendered fat and juices of an animal thickened with [[Cookbook:flour|flour]] or [[Cooking:cornstarch|cornstarch]]. Commonly, some of the fat is skimmed off before thickening. The thickener may be included in a proprietary gravy powder, which includes caramel (burnt sugar)  to colour it brown, and salt. Colour may also be added as &quot;browning&quot;, a caramel solution in water. Gravy can be flavoured with herbs and seasonings or a proprietary meat stock may be added. Poultry gravy is usually lighter in colour than gravies to accompany red meat. Gravy is usually served from a small jug called a gravy boat. 

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cooking]], a '''gravy''' is a [[Cookbook:curry|curry]] sauce.

In Italian-American cooking, gravy refers to a rich, tomato-based meat sauce.

'''Lassi''' are [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]-based shakes in either sweet or salted flavors. The most common flavors include [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]], [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rose water]], and plain [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] sweetened lassi. Lassis originate from India.

==Traditional salty (''namkin'') lassi==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (1 [[Cookbook:Liter|L]]) [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 3 c (750 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) cold water
* 1 c (250 mL) crushed ice
* fresh green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] (quantity according to taste), chopped
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], roasted and ground 
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice 
* 2 tsp salt

Combine all ingredients except ice in blender and blend until smooth. Then add ice and continue blending until frothy.

==Mild salty lassi==

Here is one possible recipe for a Salty Lassi:

* 250 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]) full-fat [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 250 mL (1 cup) chilled [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: Epee → Épée (2), epee → épée (3) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Fencing (sport)}}
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels, from students learning at a university to professional and Olympic competition. The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling another. 

These duels usually take place at tournaments. The early rounds of a competition which establish seeding for the final round will usually be &quot;five touch&quot; bouts, meaning the first fencer to score five touches on the other fencer wins the bout. From the first round fencers will be seeded and the knockout round of the competition will commence.  In this it is normal to fence until the first fencer reaches 15.  However both the seeding round or rounds and the final will have a time constraint and so a bout may finish without the full number of points scored.  The winner is then the fencer with the highest score.

What defines a touch is dependent on the style of fencing and the weapons used. The three primary weapons are the foil, the épée, and the sabre.

==Foil Fencing==

The foil is the lightest of the three weapons. It will be the weapon that most instructors will expect students to master before they move to any other weapon.  

With the foil, touches may be scored on the torso (groin to neck), with the point only.  With the épée, touches may be scored on any part of the body.  With the saber, touches may be scored with the point or the blade.  The target area is the body from hips to head.

Foil fencing introduces the concept of 'right of way.'  An attacker must establish right of way before scoring a valid point. One establishes right of way by extending the blade in a straight line toward the opponent's target area.  Until the opponent is able to regain right of way, he/she is on the defensive.  Right of way can be gained by parrying (redirecting the opponent's thrust) outside the target area and then extending one's own blade toward the opponent.  This counter-attack is termed a 'riposte.'  A fencing point often consists of an attack, a riposte, a counter-riposte, and further counter-ripostes in series until a point is scored.  Reflecting the dueling origins of modern (European) fencing, action stops after a valid touch and the fencers return to their original position at the center of the strip.

==Sabre Fencing==
In modern sabre, which is modeled after the cavalry sabre, touches are scored with hits to the head, torso and arms (hands and groin are specifically not target though). Sabre is a slashing weapon, therefore the edge of the blade is generally used to score points, though the point can be used also. This weapon is also governed by the rules of right-of-way, interpreted in the same way as the foil.

The sabre tends to be the fastest and most athletic of the three modern weapons. Fencers engage each other very quickly and the engagements rarely go beyond a few actions. Sabre fencers have had to adapt their tactics to a semi-recent rule that forbids them to bring the rear foot forward of the front. This prevents a type of attack called the fleche, which is a combination of a leap and a run. Fencers have adapted by creating the &quot;flunge,' which is essentially jumping at your opponent. Many sabre matches consist of the two fencers leaping at each other, the weapon is dominated by the quickest and most effective motions.

==Epee Fencing==

Epee is the heaviest of the three weapons and beginners, used to foil, often find this an issue in moving to this weapon.  The lack of right-of-way rule also requires unlearning.

Epee fencing is a bit of a departure from foil and sabre fencing. Epee was created as a reaction to foil fencing with the idea of creating a competition more like a &quot;real&quot; duel. The rules are modeled after the French practice of dueling to first blood drawn; touches may be scored anywhere on the body. Because no system exists for establishing the priority of an attack, both fencers may score a point simultaneously, called a 'double-touch,' as long as the hits arrive within .5 seconds of each other.

Épée tactics differ significantly from those of foil and sabre. Because the arm is also target (it is, in  fact, the primary target) fencers stay further away from each other. Épée also tends to rely less on the parry-riposte because there is no need to establish priority. While parry-riposte is still used, counterattacks are used far more frequently instead. Fencers in épée also tend to rely on deeper strategies because of the slower, more defensive nature.

      <comment>/* Swarm Capture */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
Before one can keep bees one obviously must have access to bees. There exist several methods for obtaining bees, the most common include getting bees in the form [[#Packaged Bees|packages]], [[#Nucs (nucleus hives)|nucs]], [[#Established Hives|established hives]], [[#Swarm Baiting|baiting for swarms]], from [[#Swarm Capture|swarm or capturing]] and finally by [[#Collecting Feral Hives|collecting a feral hives]].

==Packaged Bees==
In the United States packaged bees most often come from the southern warmer states, namely California, Texas and Florida. Packaged bees can often be shipped anywhere within the continental US though it may be cheaper to have a large number trucked to the desired region and have the packages distributed. Packages are in high demand as the season progresses, so it is often best to reserve the desired number of packages early on during the winter or previous fall. If an option is given, it is best to have the packages delivered so that they arrive around the time of the first bloom.
Packages are usually made available in three, four or five pound increments. For a single new hive a three-pound package of bees with a queen should be sufficient. However if desired four or five pound package can be split to make two hives, just be sure to purchase an extra queen.
Packages can be acquired from many sources and be individually be composed of differing [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races|races]] of bees. If possible it is advised to do some research when purchasing packages. There exist many [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources#Package Dealers|resources]] to acquire packages, some advertise in beekeeping [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources#Journals|journals]], others simply by word of mouth. Be sure to know what you are buying and don’t get lured in by possibly false claims. &lt;br&gt;
If you decide to go with a package be sure to learn how to [[Beekeeping/Care for a Package| care for a package of bees]] and how to [[Beekeeping/Hive a Package| hive a package]]. Also be sure you know how to [[Beekeeping/Handling Queens| handle the queen]] and [[Beekeeping/Introducing Queens| introduce the queen]] to a new package.

==Nucs (nucleus hives)==

Nucs, or nucleus hives, are in essence small self-supporting hives. Though not good for collecting extra honey, or hardy to long-term poor weather conditions, nucs make for a good way to establish new full-sized hives. Nucs often contain three to five drawn frames, but it is not unheard of to have ten full frames. One of the major benefits of nucs over packaged bees is that they should already contain a laying queen and a somewhat established colony. However, nucs cannot be transported anywhere near as easily as packaged bees and are often more expensive. Nucs can also harbor disease and pests; because of this, be sure to inspect the nuc and get its history prior to purchase. Whenever possible it may be a good idea to contact your state bee inspector prior to purchasing a nuc. &lt;br&gt;
If you find that a Nuc is how you wish to start a hive, check out information on [[Beekeeping/Moving Hives| moving hives]] and [[Beekeeping/Hiving a Nuc| hiving nucs]].

==Established Hives==

Established hives are exactly what their name implies, a fully working established hive. The upside of an established hive is that it gets to work as soon as it is placed in its new location. However, it has many of the same down falls that a nuc has, and a large hive can be rather intimidating to a novice beekeeper.
Established hives can often be acquired rather easily from retiring beekeepers; the trick is finding out before anyone else does. Other equipment may also come cheaply from such a source. Some of the best ways to find out about such a deal are by keeping in contact with your local [[Beekeeping/Beekeeping Clubs|club]], by browsing the classified ads within beekeeping [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources#Journals|journals]], and by reading local beekeeping newsletters. &lt;br&gt;
If you are thinking about going with an established hive rather than starting your own, be sure you know how to properly [[Beekeeping/Moving Hives| move a hive]].

==Swarm Baiting==

Baiting swarm traps may or may not be a successful or first-rate system for acquiring bees. Depending on the time of year captured, a swarm may not be able to sustain itself through winter; therefore, it may be best to only bait traps early within the swarm season. Whereas there is the plus that your bees would be free of charge, you may simply be acquiring more trouble than it is worth. Swarms may be of inferior stock or even [[Beekeeping/Africanized Honey Bee|africanized]]. Because of this it may not be a wise idea to capture swarms through baiting. &lt;br&gt;
However, if you still feel confident with the idea of trapping a swarm, you may wish to learn [[Beekeeping/Swarm Baiting| how to trap a swarm]] and how to [[Beekeeping/Swarm Hiving| hive a swarm]].

==Swarm Capture==

Swarms are natural occurrences for bees. Swarm capture was the original way in which beekeepers would increase the size of their apiary. Swarm capture, however, is not recommended for a novice beekeeper. Capturing a swarm can prove to be quite tricky for someone who has not had any experience working with bees. Many of the same down sides exist with swarm capture as there does with swarm trapping.
It is best to only capture swarms if you know where they originated. Sometimes your own bees may swarm or the bees of another beekeeper, these are often the prime swarms to capture. Some residential areas even have a swarm notification list in which keepers can be added and notified when some one spots a swarm. However, be aware many people believe any collection of swarming insects to be bees, so false alarms may be commonplace. &lt;br&gt;
If you still feel positive towards swarm capture, you may wish to learn [[Beekeeping/Swarms Catching| how to capture swarms]] and how to [[Beekeeping/Swarm Hiving| hive it]] once you have it.

*Can, but not necessarily, lead to being badly stung

==Collecting Feral Hives==

Feral hive collection may be the most labor intensive and dangerous way to acquire bees. First year beekeepers should not perform such task, in fact many veteran beekeepers won’t even dismantle a feral hive in order to acquire bees. Feral hives can be found within hollow trees, large flowerpots, and house walls or even hanging from trees or other such locations. Because the hive is established, capturing a colony almost always requires destroying its surroundings, causing the bees within to become very irritated. This should not be done without full [[Beekeeping/Protective Gear| Protective Gear]]. Any damages done to property may be the responsibility of the collector, so be sure to sign a contract before extracting bees.&lt;br&gt;
Collecting a feral hive is no easy task, but if you decide to take that route be sure you are familiar with the process of [[Beekeeping/Collecting Feral Hives| collecting a feral hive]] and know how to [[Beekeeping/Hiving Feral Hives| hive it]].

      <comment>/* Introduction to Aspect */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:At the time of creation, this document will be left in great need of amplification.  This, nevertheless, shall be a start.

==Introduction to Aspect==
For most native speakers of English (and indeed of many other languages) one of the most difficult tasks in learning Russian is learning to cope with the complexity of Russian verbs.  Unlike, say, Spanish and German, where the great difficulty lies in memorizing the many forms of verbs (much more than the Russian system), the difficulty in Russian is in coming to understand a property inherent to each verb: aspect.

All verbs in Russian have an aspect. Some verbs exist in aspectual pairs, but certainly not most of them. In the case of an aspectual pair, one word is the imperfective aspect of that verb, and the other is the perfective aspect. Very roughly, the difference is that the imperfective aspect is used when the action is incomplete, while the perfective aspect is used when the action ''is'' complete.
Rather than expound more theory here, we shall proceed by considering an example. Let us take the verbs &quot;to speak&quot; (imperfective: '''говори́ть''', perfective: '''сказа́ть''') and &quot;to do&quot; (imper.: '''де́лать''', per.: '''сде́лать'''). Consider these example sentences that use ''imperfective'' aspects:

:Misha, what were you doing after lunch? - '''Мишa, что ты ''де́лал'' после обеда?'''
:I was talking to Katya - '''Я ''говори́л'' с Катей'''

Note that the verbs here describe a process.  It is also possible to consider this as a complete action, but as written the concern is not with whether the action is complete, but simply what was happening.  The first speaker wondered what Misha was doing after lunch.  The first speaker could be Misha's boss, wondering why he was not at his desk. Now, let's consider the same sentences with ''perfective'' aspects:

:Misha, what did you do after lunch? - '''Миша, что ты ''сде́лал'' после обеда?'''
:I told my mother about my grades - '''Я ''сказа́л'' мое́й маме об отметках'''

In this example, it's the outcome of the action that is of importance.  The first speaker could be Misha's father, wondering why his mother was so upset when he arrived home from work.

== Forming aspectual pairs ==
So, verbs in Russian have two words: an ''imperfective'' and a ''perfective'' aspect. For example, 'to speak' is both '''говорить''' (imperfective) and '''сказать''' (perfective). Can we predict the form of one aspect if we know the other? Does every verb even have a pair of aspects?  Almost always, the answer is a definite 'yes'; take, for instance, '''делать/сделать''' both mean 'to do' or 'to make', and the latter is clearly the former with a prefix - most perfective verbs are simply their imperfective counterpart with a prefix.

=== Prefixes and the perfectives ===
Many verbs come in pairs like '''делать/сделать''', with the perfective variant simply being the imperfective with a prefix. For instance, '''написать''' is the perfective of '''писать''' ('to write'), '''посмотреть''' is the perfective of '''смотреть''' ('to watch'), and we've already seen the imperfective '''делать''' and the perfective '''сделать''' ('to do'). For such verbs, the aspectual pair will often be given in dictionaries as a prefix indicated in parentheses: '''(с)делать, (по)смотреть, (на)писать''', etc. Such pairs of aspects are easy to learn, as the perfective also conjugates the same as the imperfective, only with a prefix.

However, one has to be careful with prefixes. While the perfective can be formed by a prefix, other prefixes can be applied to an imperfective to make a whole new verbal pair. For instance, we can add the prefix '''от''' to the imperfective '''говорить''' to make the new perfective '''отговорить''', meaning 'to dissuade'. From this, we can derive a new imperfective aspect, '''отговаривать'''. Another aspectual pair we can derive from '''говорить''' is '''договариваться''' (impf.) and '''договориться''' (perf.), meaning &quot;to agree&quot;. So we have three pairs derived using prefixes:
: '''говорить''' (impf.) and '''сказать''' (pf.)
: '''отговаривать''' (impf.) and '''отговорить''' (pf.)
: '''договариваться''' (impf.) and '''договориться''' (pf.)
In other words, the easiest way to remember aspectual pairs is to learn the imperfective and learn the 'perfective prefix'. The prefix itself is largely unpredictable (the most common is '''по-''', and others are '''про-''', '''на-''', '''за-''', etc), not all verbs form their perfective aspect with a prefix, and some prefixes can create whole new verbs.

=== Other ways to predict aspect ===
Is there any other way to predict whether a new word is perfective or imperfective? Yes: if it contains '''-ыва-''', it is almost certainly ''imperfective'', and the corresponding perfective is the same word without the '''-ыв-'''.
: '''опаздывать''' (impf.) and '''опоздать''' (pf.) - 'to be late'
: '''рассказывать''' (impf.) and '''рассказать''' (pf.) - 'to tell, recount'
As ever, exceptions are plentiful, such as '''покупать''' (impf.) and '''купить''' (pf.) - 'to buy'.

=== Multi-aspect verbs ===
Rarely, some verbs have more than two aspects; for example, '''читать''', '''прочитать''', and '''почитать''' all mean 'to read'.  The first is the standard imperfective, and means simply 'to read'. The second verb shown, '''прочитать''', is the standard perfective aspectual partner of '''читать''', but also more specifically means, 'to read an entire work'.  The last verb, '''почитать''', is also perfective, and so also describes a complete action. However, its more specific meaning is, 'to read for some period of time' or 'to read for a while'. Fortunately, these are rare, and only really occur in verbs of motion.

=== Unpredictable pairs ===
Some verbs have unpredictable pairs of aspects, such as:
:'''говорить''' (impf.) and '''сказать''' (pf.) - 'to say, speak, tell'
:'''брать''' (impf.) and '''взять''' (pf.) - 'to take, get, obtain'

Finally, there are a few verbs that do not have an aspectual partner, such as '''быть''' (pf., 'to be').

==Why must I endure this?==
In short, all of this is to say that there are two types of verbs in Russian, perfective verbs, and imperfective verbs.  Perfective verbs carry the meaning of complete action, while imperfective verbs carry the meaning of a process or state.  When choosing a verb to utter, it is important to choose a verb of the proper aspect.  

Beyond the semantic difference, there is a formal difference that you will see when studying verb conjugation and tense formation.  Namely, while perfective and imperfective verbs can appear in the past or in the future, only imperfective verbs can appear in the present tense.  What happens if you try to make a present-tense form of a perfective verb?  You get a perfective verb with future meaning.  Imperfective verbs are put into the future tense by another mechanism (in fact, by a mechanism much more like that used in English -- namely, the use of a helping verb).  This may seem like a rather odd way to handle things, and perhaps it is.  In any case, Russians don't seem to mind.  The reason, for those of us who like to believe there are reasons for these things, is that a complete action cannot occur &quot;now&quot;.  At the instant we call &quot;now&quot;, a complete action must either have already been completed, or remain to be completed.  &quot;Now&quot; can only point to the process of an action.

==In conclusion==
Verbal aspect is a very important feature of Russian, and should be considered (consciously or otherwise) whenever a Russian verb is encountered or is to be rendered.  If you consider aspect each time you encounter a verb, it won't take long to get a good feel for aspect.  As for producing Russian in writing or in speech, this is one more thing to think about before you open the gates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">New Zealand was settled by [[Polynesia]]n voyagers over a period extending from about AD 800 to 1300. They had no written language, as far as anyone knows, but had and still have a rich oral tradition where eveyone learned about his or her ancestry.

After European contact they came to be known as the &quot;[[Maori]]&quot; people, with the same word applied to all mainland dialects of their language and to the closely related language of the [[Cook Islands]].

In [[1642]] a Dutch expedition under [[Abel Tasman]] &quot;discovered&quot; the country, mapping some of its west coast. The country's current name is an Anglicised version of a name Dutch cartographers applied to it. Tasman's name is applied to a few features such as a large bay (one of the earliest he visited) and a glacier (which he was never near).

The next visit from [[Europe]]ans was much more detailed. In [[1769]], after observing a Transit of Venus from [[Tahiti]], Englishman [[James Cook]] brought his expedition south on the strength of secret Government orders to look for southern lands to colonise. Sailing west, he reached the [[Gisborne]] area and ended up circumnavigating the whole country and encouraging his scientists to make detailed studies of flora and fauna. He claimed it for Britain. His name is commemorated in the highest mountaintop, the strait between the two main islands, and a number of other places.

Whalers and sealers were the main visitors over the next few decades. In the early 19th century, Europeans brought to the natives a variety of new things such as Christianity, writing, disease, and muskets, and a few traders set up trading posts or became farmers.

In 1840, the same year as some planned settlements (e.g. Wellington) took place, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the representatives of [[Queen Victoria]] of Great Britain (just 4 days before her wedding) and leaders of the Maori people, who were given the status and protection of British subjects in return for officially allowing the British to settle and to buy land and to govern. Debate about what the Maori signatories thought they were giving away remains a great talking-point, but relations between the races are more amicable in New Zealand than in most colonised countries. Extensive intermarriage continues.

British government systems led to such institutions as [[census]]es and the registration of [[birth]]s, [[marriage]]s, and [[death]]s, very like the systems that were developing in Britain in the mid-19th century. The early registrations were, as in Britain, a bit short on detail from a genealogy viewpoint, but later that century more details were added to the requirements.

'''Sulfur dioxide''' is an [[Cookbook:Antioxidants|antioxidant]] used as a food preservative.
It allows [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricots]] and light-colored [[Cookbook:Grape|grapes]] to be dried without darkening. Many people find yellow [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] and yellow-orange dried apricots to be more attractive than brown ones.

Consumption of foods containing sulfur dioxide can cause lung irritation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''(All the examples in this chapter can be typed into a Haskell source file and evaluated by loading that file into GHC or Hugs.'')

==Variables that Don't and Functions that Do==
One of the main ideas behind functional programming is that of ''referential transparency''. This refers to the fact that a function and a parameter can always be replaced by the function's return value: for example, 2+2 is (almost) completely indistinguishable from 4. This facilitates a number of very important concepts in Haskell, like lazy evaluation and the ability to reorder expressions to execute them concurrently.

The above aren't the only reasons why this is done, but you'll find out more about them as you read on about Haskell.

Haskell variables, unlike those in imperative languages such as C++, are not memory locations. They are bound to a particular value for their lifetimes and are more like constants than variables in most cases.  This is the same as the idea of a variable in math. In the following example, x is bound to 3; it can't possibly change.

 x = 6 / 2

This may seem extremely weird if you've never seen it before. You're also most likely asking yourself, how can I write useful programs without actual variables? Well, Haskell's function parameters can serve the same purpose: once you pass a value to a function, that function can use it wherever it wants. To change the value of a parameter, just call the function again. So the answer is recursion.

Here are some Haskell declarations:

 x = 3
 y = x * 2

As you've probably guessed, by the end y = 6. Looks quite a bit like math doesn't it?

However, unlike a conventional language, the order doesn't matter.  Haskell doesn't have a notion of &quot;flow of control&quot;, so it doesn't start executing at the top and working its way down.  So this means exactly the same as the above:

 y = x * 2
 x = 3

You can of course also define functions. This is where life starts to get a little more interesting.

 double x = x * 2
 z = double y

This says that the function &quot;double&quot; takes an argument &quot;x&quot; and the result is equal to twice x.  Note the lack of parentheses: in Haskell &quot;double y&quot; means apply the function &quot;double&quot; to the value &quot;y&quot;.  Parentheses are only needed to determine evaluation priority, just like in math.

So far this lets you do about as much as a spreadsheet would: variables in this world look a lot like cells in a spreadsheet, and you can set up functions that can &quot;do&quot; things with these variables.

Now look at this function:

 factorial 0 = 1
 factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)

This defines a new function called &quot;factorial&quot;.  The first line says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the second one says that the factorial of any other number &quot;n&quot; is equal to &quot;n&quot; times the factorial of &quot;n-1&quot;.  Note the parentheses around the &quot;n-1&quot;: without them this would have been parsed as &quot;(factorial n) - 1&quot;; function application (as this process is known) has higher precedence than any regular operator like addition or exponentiation.

This shows how you do &quot;loops&quot; in Haskell.  You can't have a loop counter like &quot;n = n - 1&quot; because that would change the value of &quot;n&quot;. So instead you use recursion.

Unlike the other example, the order of the two recursive declarations ''is'' important.  Haskell matches function calls starting at the top and picking the first one that matches.  So if the two declarations were reversed then the compiler would conclude that factorial 0 equals 0 * factorial -1, and so on to infinity.  Not what we want.

==Tail Recursion==
In case you're wondering about stack space, won't all this recursion eventually overflow the stack? The answer is that Haskell supports [[W:tail recursion|tail recursion]] (every decent functional language's compiler does).  Tail recursion is the idea that if the ''last'' thing a function does is call itself, the interpreter may as well not bother putting things on the stack, and just &quot;jump&quot; to the beginning using the function's new arguments. In this case, though, the factorial function has to call itself with &quot;(n-1)&quot; and then multiply the result by &quot;n&quot;.

So our factorial function isn't tail recursive (because it has to multiply result by n after calling itself).  This one is, though:

 factorial n = factorial' n 1
 
 factorial' 0 a = a
 factorial' n a = factorial' (n-1) (n*a)

Here are two functions.  They have almost the same name, except the second has a tick mark. (Haskell identifiers are allowed to contain tick marks.) By convention, it is used to indicate a variation on something.

Here, the factorial' function takes an argument &quot;n&quot; as before, but it also takes a second &quot;accumulator&quot; argument. Because calling itself is the last thing it does the tail recursion rule applies: nothing gets put on the stack; the factorial' function simply executes as if its arguments had always been n-1 and n*a.

(Note the similarity between this parameter and a variable. Parameters are, in a way, the variables of Haskell.)

A programmer using this function doesn't want to worry about the accumulator argument, so the plain factorial function is used to &quot;wrap up&quot; factorial' by supplying the initial value of the accumulator.

===Exercises===
Type the factorial function into a Haskell source file and load it into your favourite Haskell environment.

What is factorial 5?

What about factorial 1000?  Is that what you expected?

What about factorial -1?

You may have noticed something interesting above. None of your parameters or anything was declared to be of any particular type.

That's because Haskell uses a type system to infer the type of every expression, the Hindley-Milner type system. But Haskell is not weakly typed; it's strongly typed like C++, so you can't get runtime type errors. Any program that compiles is guaranteed to not have type errors in it. Another advantage is that when you make a mistake, it will almost always change the type of the resulting expression, and it'll be flagged by the compiler as such. (Your program simply won't compile.) You may still want to write types for your functions for a few reasons.

#It helps to document your program.
#When you get something wrong, the type declarations help to narrow down the source of the problem.
#Most importantly, it will help you learn. Understanding the type system is fundamental to getting a good grasp on Haskell.

The syntax for type declarations looks like this:

 x :: Integer
 factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer

You should read the first declaration as saying &quot;x is of type Integer&quot; or &quot;x has type Integer&quot;.  The '::' tells us we're referring to a type. You'll note factorial looks a bit different.  It's a function that takes an Integer and returns an Integer. Later on you'll see why we use -&gt; in describing the types, and why describing the type of a function is so close syntactically to describing the type of a variable.

One final note: identifiers that start with uppercase letters are reserved for types, modules and data constructors (somewhat like namespaces, don't worry about these for now). If you try to declare a variable or function that begins with an uppercase letter, the compiler will complain.

As I stumble around in the darkness--attempting to arrange the concept of Wiki, and how it relates to my work as a pre-service English Teacher--I have posted this page to act as an anchor from which superlative hopes will be thrust upon.

I am currently wrestling my way though my student teaching. I would love for Wiki to be my guide through much of what I am going through. I am very interested in taking any Creative Writing classes (preferably in the more advanced realm) or Graduate Level English courses. 

More importantly, I wish to become a regular in the Area of Wikiversity. I am excited at the possibilites that open source education has to offer.

I am an amateur fiction writer, and my scribblings can be found at my modest green and white web log, right [http://www.kronski.com here].


Anyone who is interested in open source Writing or Literature education, nudge me awake, and call me to action.</text>

I removed these parts of the text:

''Hei (around Helsinki), Moi (around the western coast), Terve (around in the Lakelands), Moro (in Tampere region).''

''Hei hei (around Helsinki and the east) or Moi moi (around the western coast).''

''Hei'', ''moi'', ''terve'' and ''moro'' are used in informal speech everywhere in Finland. ''Hei hei'' and ''moi moi'' are such unsignificant slang words, that they should not be mentioned in this part of the book.

Also, I am moving this page to Finnish:Hyvää päivää instead of Finnish:Hyvä päivää, as the present form is a clerical error. - [[User:Zeal|Zeal]] 21:15, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
----
Very confused:
&quot;Hei, Moi, Terve and Moro.

Hi or Hello, an informal greeting, though moro is a bit more unusual word and terve is slightly less informal than the others. The last two are even more informal than the previous. &quot;

Hunh?  So which is it, terve is &quot;less informal&quot; or &quot;even more informal&quot; ?

I changed translation of &quot;Hyvää päivää&quot; into following:
literally &quot;Good day&quot;. Very common, rather formal greeting.
'Good Day' is often used insultingly in English, so it is no way a correct translation of Hyvää Päivää.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sociology''' is the study of human social life. Sociology has many sub-sections of study, ranging from the analysis of conversations to the development of theories to try to understand how the entire world works.  This chapter will introduce you to sociology and explain why it is important, how it can change your perspective of the world around you, and give a brief history of the discipline.

==What is Sociology?==
[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Emile Durkheim, one of the founders of Sociology.]]

Sociology is a branch of the social sciences that uses systematic methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop and refine a body of knowledge about human social structure and activity, sometimes with the goal of applying such knowledge to the pursuit of government policies designed to benefit the general social welfare. Its subject matter ranges from the micro level to the macro level. Microsociology involves the study of people in face-to-face interactions. Macrosociology involves the study of widespread social processes.

Sociology is a broad discipline in terms of both methodology and subject matter. Its traditional focuses have included social relations, social stratification, social interaction, culture and deviance, and its approaches have included both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. As much of what humans do fits under the category of social structure or social activity, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to such far-flung subjects as the study of economic activity, health disparities, and even the role of social activity in the creation of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2008&quot;&gt;Moore, Kelly. 2008. Disrupting Science: Social Movements, American Scientists, and the Politics of the Military, 1945-1975. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of social scientific methods has also been broadly expanded. The &quot;cultural turn&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s brought more humanistic interpretive approaches to the study of culture in sociology. Conversely, the same decades saw the rise of new mathematically rigorous approaches, such as social network analysis.

The social world is changing. Some argue it is growing; others say it is shrinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; The important point to grasp is: society does not remain unchanged over time. As will be discussed in more detail below, sociology has its roots in significant societal changes (e.g., the [[w:Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], the creation of [[w:empire|empires]], and the age of [[w:Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of scientific reasoning). Early practitioners developed the discipline as an attempt to understand societal changes.

Some early sociological theorists (e.g., Marx, Weber, and Durkheim) were disturbed by the social processes they believed to be driving the change, such as the quest for solidarity, the attainment of social goals, and the rise and fall of classes, to name a few examples. The founders of sociology were some of the earliest individuals to employ what C. Wright Mills (a prominent mid-20th century American sociologist) labeled the sociological imagination: the ability to situate personal troubles within an informed framework of social issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills2000&quot;&gt;Mills, C. Wright. 2000. The Sociological Imagination. 40th ed. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mills proposed that:

:&quot;What people need... is a quality of mind that will help them to use information and to develop reason in order to achieve lucid summations of what is going on in the world and of what may be happening within themselves. The sociological imagination enables its possessor to understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner life and the external career of a variety of individuals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills2000&quot;/&gt;

As Mills saw it, the sociological imagination could help individuals cope with the social world by helping them to step outside of their personal, self-centric view of the world. In employing the sociological imagination, people are able to see the events and social structures that influence behavior, attitudes, and culture.

The sociological imagination goes beyond armchair sociology or common sense. Many people believe they understand the world and the events taking place within it, even though they have not actually engaged in a systematic attempt to understanding the social world, as sociologists do. Humans like to attribute causes to events and attempt to understand what is taking place around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer2002&quot;&gt;Boyer, Pascal. 2002. Religion Explained. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This is why individuals have been using religious ceremonies for centuries to invoke the will of the gods - because they believed the gods controlled certain elements of the natural world (e.g., the weather). Just as sacrificing two goats to ensure the safe operation of a Boeing 757 (and propitiate Akash Bhairab, the Hindu sky god) is an attempt to influence the natural world without first trying to understand how it works,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tierney2008&quot;&gt;Tierney, John. 2008. “Appeasing the Gods, With Insurance.” The International Herald Tribune, May 7 http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/07/healthscience/06tier.php (Accessed August 17, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  armchair sociology is an attempt to understand how the social world works without employing scientific methods.

It would be inaccurate to say sociologists never sit around (even sometimes in comfy armchairs) trying to figure out how the world works. But [[w:Inductive reasoning|induction]] is just a first step in understanding the social world. In order to test their theories, sociologists get up from their armchairs and enter the social world. They gather [[w:data|data]] and evaluate their theories in light of the data they collect (a.k.a. [[w:Deductive reasoning|deduction]]). Sociologists do not just propose theories about how the social world works. Sociologists test their theories about how the world works using the [[w:scientific method|scientific method]].

Sociologists, like all humans, have [[w:values|values]], [[w:beliefs|beliefs]], and even pre-conceived notions of what they might find in doing their research. But, as [[w:Peter Berger|Peter Berger]], a well-known sociologist, has argued, what distinguishes the sociologist from non-scientific researchers is that &quot;[the] sociologist tries to see what is there. He may have hopes or fears concerning what he may find. But he will try to see, regardless of his hopes or fears. It is thus an act of pure perception...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1963&quot;&gt;Berger, Peter L. 1963. Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective. 1st ed. Anchor. ISBN 0385065299&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociology, then, is an attempt to understand the social world by situating social events in their corresponding environment (i.e., social structure, culture, history) and trying to understand social phenomena by collecting and analyzing empirical data.

==History==
Sociology is a relatively new academic discipline.  It emerged in the early 19th century in response to the challenges of [[w:modernity|modernity]]. Increasing mobility and technological advances resulted in the increasing exposure of people to cultures and societies different from their own.  The impact of this exposure was varied, but for some people included the breakdown of traditional [[w:norms|norms]] and customs and warranted a  revised understanding of how the world works.  Sociologists responded to these changes by trying to understand what holds social groups together and also exploring possible solutions to the breakdown of [[w:social solidarity|social solidarity]].  

===Auguste Comte and Other Founders===

[[Image:Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[w:Auguste Comte|Auguste Comte]], who coined the term ''sociology'']]

The term ''sociology'' was recoined by [[w:Auguste Comte|Auguste Comte]] (1798-1857) in 1838 from the [[w:latin language|Latin]] term ''socius'' (companion, associate) and the [[w:greek language|Greek]] term ''logia'' (study of, speech). Comte hoped to unify all the sciences under sociology; he believed sociology held the potential to improve society and direct human activity, including the other sciences. 

While it is no longer a theory employed in Sociology, Comte argued for an understanding of society he labeled ''The Law of Three Stages''.  Comte, not unlike other enlightenment thinkers, believed society developed in stages.  The first was the '''theological stage''' where people took a religious view of society. The second was the '''metaphysical stage''' where people understood society as natural (not [[w:supernature|supernatural]]).  Comte's final stage was the [[w:scientific|scientific]] or '''[[w:positivism|positivist]] stage''', which he believed to be the pinnacle of social development.  In the scientific stage, society would be governed by reliable knowledge and would be understood in light of the knowledge produced by science, primarily sociology.  While vague connections between Comte's ''Law'' and human history can be seen, it is generally understood in Sociology today that Comte's approach is a highly simplified and ill-founded approach to understand social development (see instead [[w:demographic transition|demographic transition theory]] and [[w:Ecological-Evolutionary Theory|Ecological-Evolutionary Theory]]).

Other ''classical'' theorists of sociology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]], [[w:Ferdinand Toennies|Ferdinand Toennies]], [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], [[w:Vilfredo Pareto|Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]]. As pioneers in Sociology, most of the early sociological thinkers were trained in other academic disciplines, including history, philosophy, and economics.  The diversity of their trainings is reflected in the topics they researched, including [[w:religion|religion]], [[w:education|education]], [[w:economics|economics]], [[w:psychology|psychology]], [[w:ethics|ethics]], [[w:philosophy|philosophy]], and [[w:theology|theology]]. Perhaps with the exception of Marx, their most enduring influence has been on sociology, and it is in this field that their theories are still considered most applicable.

===The Development of the Discipline===



The first book with the term ''sociology'' in its title was written in the mid-19th century by the English philosopher [[w:Herbert Spencer|Herbert Spencer]]. In the United States, the first ''Sociology'' course was taught at the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1890 under the title ''Elements of Sociology'' (the oldest continuing sociology course in America). The first full fledged university department of sociology in the United States was established in 1892 at the University of Chicago by [[w:Albion W. Small|Albion W. Small]], who in 1895 founded the [[w:American Journal of Sociology|American Journal of Sociology]]. The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], founder of [[w:Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]] (1896). In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] and in 1920 in Poland by [[w:Florian Znaniecki|Florian Znaniecki]]. The first sociology departments in the United Kingdom were founded after the Second World War.

International cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when [[w:Rene Worms|Rene Worms]] founded the small [[w:Institut International de Sociologie|Institut International de Sociologie]] that was eclipsed by the much larger [[w:International Sociologist Association|International Sociologist Association]] starting in 1949. In 1905 the [[w:American Sociological Association|American Sociological Association]], the world's largest association of professional sociologists, was founded.

[[Image:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]]]

===Early Sociological Studies===

Early sociological studies considered the field to be similar to the [[w:natural science|natural sciences]], like [[:physics|physics]] or [[w:biology|biology]]. As a result, many researchers argued that the [[w:methodology|methodology]] used in the natural sciences was perfectly suited for use in the social sciences. The effect of employing the [[w:scientific method|scientific method]] and stressing [[w:empiricism|empiricism]] was the distinction of sociology from [[w:theology|theology]], [[w:philosophy|philosophy]], and [[w:metaphysics|metaphysics]].  This also resulted in sociology being recognized as an empirical science. This early sociological approach, supported by August Comte, led to [[w:positivism|positivism]], a methodological approach based on [[w:sociological naturalism|sociological naturalism]].  The goal of positivism, like the natural sciences, is prediction.  But in the case of sociology, it is prediction of human behavior, which is a complicated proposition.

The goal of predicting human behavior was quickly realized to be a bit lofty.  Scientists like [[w:Wilhelm Dilthey|Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[w:Heinrich Rickert|Heinrich Rickert]] argued that the natural world differs from the social world, as human society has [[w:culture|culture]], unlike the societies of most other animals (e.g., the behavior of ants, wolves, etc. is primarily based on genetic instructions and is not passed from generation to generation through ''socialization'').  As a result, an additional goal was proposed for sociology. Max Weber&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1997&quot;&gt;Weber, Max. 1997. The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilhelm Dilthey&lt;ref name=&quot;Dilthey1978&quot;&gt;Dilthey, W. 1978. Descriptive Psychology and Historical Understanding. 1st ed. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of '''[[w:verstehen|verstehen]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glass2005&quot;&gt;Glass, John E. 2005. “Visceral Verstehen.” Electronic Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of ''verstehen'' is less to predict behavior than it is to understand behavior.  Outside observers of a culture relate to an indigenous people on both the observer's and the observeds' own terms in order to comprehend the cultural conditions.  While arriving at a verstehen-like understanding of a culture employs systematic methodologies like the positivistic approach of predicting human behavior, it is often a more subjective process.  

The inability of sociology and other social sciences to perfectly predict the behavior of humans or to fully comprehend a different culture has led to the social sciences being labeled &quot;soft sciences.&quot;  While some might consider this label derogatory, in a sense it can be seen as an admission of the remarkable complexity of humans as social animals.  Any animal as complex as humans is bound to be difficult to fully comprehend.  What's more, humans, human society, and human culture are all constantly changing, which means the social sciences will constantly be works in progress.

===Quantitative vs. Qualitative Sociology ===

The contrast between positivist sociology and the verstehen approach has been reformulated in modern sociology as a distinction between '''quantitative''' and '''qualitative''' methodological approaches, respectively. Quantitative sociology is generally a numerical approach to understanding human behavior.  Surveys with large numbers of participants are aggregated into data sets and analyzed using statistics, allowing researchers to discern patterns in human behavior.  Qualitative sociology generally opts for depth over breadth.  The qualitative approach uses in-depth interviews, focus groups, or analysis of content sources (books, magazines, journals, TV shows, etc.) as the data source.  These sources are then analyzed systematically to discern patterns and to arrive at a better understanding of human behavior. 

Drawing a hard and fast distinction between quantitative and qualitative sociology is a bit misleading. The first step in all sciences is the development of a theory and the generation of testable hypotheses.  While there are some individuals who begin analyzing data without a theoretical orientation to guide their analysis,&lt;ref name=&quot;Denzin2007&quot;&gt;Denzin, Norman K., and Yvonna S. Lincoln. 2007. Collecting and Interpreting Qualitative Materials. Third Edition. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; most begin with a theoretical idea or question and gather data to test that theory.  The second step is the collection of data.  This is really where the two approaches differ.  Quantitative sociology focuses on numerical representations of the research subjects (e.g., Do [[w:conservative Christian|conservative Christian]] fathers spend more time in child care than [[w:secular|secular]] fathers, when measured in hours?&lt;ref name=&quot;Civettini2008&quot;&gt;Civettini, Nicole H. W., and Jennifer Glass. 2008. “The Impact of Religious Conservativism on Men's Work and Family Involvement.” Gender &amp; Society 22:172-193.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Qualitative sociology focuses on the ideas found within the discourse and rhetoric of the research subjects (e.g., What is the narrative homosexual men use to explain their continued participation in religions that condemn their sexual orientation?&lt;ref name=&quot;Loseke2001&quot;&gt;Loseke, Donileen R., and James C. Cavendish. 2001. “Producing Institutional Selves: Rhetorically Constructing the Dignity of Sexually Marginalized Catholics..” Social Psychology Quarterly 64:347-362.&lt;/ref&gt;).  The goal of both approaches is to answer a question and/or test a theory.

== Sociology and Other Social Sciences ==
The '''social sciences''' comprise the application of [[w:scientific method|scientific method]]s to the study of the human aspects of the world. [[w:Psychology|Psychology]] studies the human [[w:mind|mind]] and micro-level (or individual) behavior; sociology examines human society; [[w:political science|political science]] studies the governing of groups and countries; [[w:communication|communication]] studies the flow of discourse via various media; [[w:economics|economics]] concerns itself with the production and allocation of wealth in society; and [[w:social work|social work]] is the application of social scientific knowledge in society. Social sciences diverge from the [[w:humanities|humanities]] in that many in the social sciences emphasize  the scientific method or other rigorous standards of evidence in the study of humanity.

=== The Development of Social Science ===



In ancient philosophy, there was no difference between the liberal arts of mathematics and the study of history, poetry or politics. Only with the development of mathematical proof did there gradually arise a perceived difference between ''scientific'' disciplines and the ''humanities'' or ''liberal arts''. Thus, [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] studied planetary motion and poetry with the same methods; [[w:Plato|Plato]] mixed geometrical proofs with his demonstration on the state of intrinsic knowledge. 

This unity of science as descriptive remained, for example, in the time of [[w:Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], who argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework.  His book, ''[[w:Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'', was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. Within decades of Hobbes' work a revolution took place in what constituted ''science'', particularly with the work of [[w:Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton]] in physics. Newton, by revolutionizing what was then called ''natural philosophy'', changed the basic framework by which individuals understood what was ''scientific''. 

While Newton was merely the archetype of an accelerating trend, the important distinction is that for Newton the mathematical flowed from a presumed reality independent of the observer and it worked by its own rules. For philosophers of the same period, mathematical expression of philosophical ideals were taken to be symbolic of natural human relationships as well: the same laws moved physical and spiritual reality. For examples see [[w:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]], [[w:Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[w:Johannes Kepler|Johannes Kepler]], each of whom took mathematical examples as models for human behavior directly. In Pascal's case, the famous wager; for Leibniz, the invention of binary computation; and for Kepler, the intervention of angels to guide the planets.

In the realm of other disciplines, this created a pressure to express ideas in the form of mathematical relationships. Such relationships, called ''Laws'' after the usage of the time (see [[w:philosophy of science|philosophy of science]]) became the model that other disciplines would emulate. In the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about human behavior became increasingly common. Among the first were the ''Laws'' of philology, which attempted to map the change overtime of sounds in a language. In the early 20th century, a wave of change came to science. [[w:statistics|Statistics]] and [[w:probability|probability theory]] were sufficiently developed to be considered &quot;scientific&quot;, resulting in the widespread use of statistics in the social sciences (they are also widely used in most other sciences as well, including biology).

The first thinkers to attempt to combine scientific inquiry with the exploration of human relationships were [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]] in France and [[w:William James|William James]] in the United States. Durkheim's sociological theories and James' work on experimental psychology had an enormous impact on those who followed. 

One of the most persuasive advocates for the view of scientific treatment of philosophy is [[w:John Dewey|John Dewey]] (1859-1952). He began, as Marx did, in an attempt to weld Hegelian idealism and logic to experimental science, for example in his ''Psychology'' of 1887. However, it is when he abandoned Hegelian constructs and joined the movement in America called [[w:Pragmatism|Pragmatism]] that he began to formulate his basic doctrine on the three phases of the process of inquiry:

#problematic situation, where the typical response is inadequate
#isolation of data or subject matter
#reflective, which is tested empirically

With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences (see, for example [[w:Lord Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]]'s famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically &quot;is a poor sort of knowledge&quot;), the stage was set for the division of the study of humanity into the humanities and the ''social sciences''.

==Sociology Today==
Although sociology emerged from Comte's vision of a discipline that would subsume all other areas of scientific inquiry, that was not to be the future of sociology.  Far from replacing the other sciences, sociology has taken its place as a particular perspective for investigating human social life.

In the past, sociological research focused on the organization of complex, [[w:industrial society|industrial societies]] and their influence on individuals. Today, sociologists study a broad range of topics. For instance, some sociologists research [[w:social structure|macro-structures]] that organize society, such as [[w:race|race]] or [[w:ethnicity|ethnicity]], [[w:social class|social class]], [[w:gender role|gender roles]], and institutions such as the [[w:family|family]]. Other sociologists study social processes that represent the breakdown of macro-structures, including [[w:deviance|deviance]], [[w:crime|crime]], and [[w:divorce|divorce]]. Additionally, some sociologists study micro-processes such as interpersonal interactions and the [[w:socialization|socialization]] of individuals.  It should also be noted that recent sociologists, taking cues from anthropologists, have realized the ''[[w:Western|Western]]'' emphasis of the discipline. In response, many sociology departments around the world are now encouraging multi-cultural research.

The next two chapters in this book will introduce the reader to more extensive discussions of the methods and theory employed in sociology.  The remaining chapters are examinations of current areas of research in the discipline.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==


The simplest definition of '''society''' is a group of people who share a defined territory and a culture.  In sociology, we take that definition a little further by arguing that society is also the social structure and interactions of that group of people. Social structure is the relatively enduring patterns of behavior and relationships within a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merton1938&quot;&gt;Merton, Robert. 1938. Social Structure. Filipino Sociological Review, Vol. 3, No.5, pp.672-682&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a society is not only the group of people and their culture, but the relationships between the people and the institutions within that group.

In sociology, a distinction is made between society and culture.  Culture refers to the norms, values, beliefs, behaviors, and meanings given to symbols in a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swidler2003&quot;&gt;Swidler, A. (2003). Talk of Love: How Culture Matters. University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture is distinct from society in that it adds meanings to relationships.  For instance, what it means to be a &quot;husband&quot; to a gay couple in Boston is very different from what it means to be a husband to a polygamist man in rural southern Utah.  Thus, while the relationship exists in both (i.e., they both have social structure), what the relationship means differs by culture.

All human societies have a culture and culture can only exist where there is a society.  Sociologists distinguish between society and culture despite their close interconnectedness primarily for analytical purposes: It allows sociologists to think about societal development independent of culture and cultural change (which are discussed in the next chapter in greater detail) even though societal change and development are contingent upon culture. 

This chapter presents a brief overview of some of the types of human societies that have existed and continue to exist.  It will then present some classic approaches to understanding society and what changing social structure can mean for individuals.

==Societal Development==
The sociological understanding of societal development relies heavily upon the work of [[w:Gerhard Emmanuel Lenski|Gerhard Lenski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenski1995&quot;&gt;Lenski, Gerhard; Nolan, Patrick; and Lenski, Jean. 1995. Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology. 7th edition. New York: McGraw-Hill. ISBN 1594510237&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenski outlined some of the more commonly seen organizational structures in human societies. Classifications of human societies can be based on two factors: (1) the primary means of subsistence and (2) the political structure.  This chapter focuses on the subsistence systems of societies rather than their political structures.

While it is a bit far-reaching to argue that all societies will develop through the stages outlined below, it does appear that most societies follow such a route.  Human groups begin as hunter-gatherers, move toward pastoralism and/or horticulturalism, develop toward an agrarian society, and ultimately end up undergoing a period of industrialization (with the potential for developing a service industry following industrialization).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;/&gt;  Not all societies pass through every stage.  Some societies have stopped at the pastoral or horticultural stage (e.g., Bedouin nomads), though these may be temporary pauses due to economic niches that will likely disappear over time.  Some societies may also jump stages as a result of the introduction of technology from other societies.  It is also worth noting that these categories aren't really distinct groups as there is often overlap in the subsistence systems used in a society.  Some pastoralist societies also engage in some measure of horticultural food production and most industrial and post-industrial societies still have agriculture, just in a reduced capacity.  

===Hunter-Gatherer===
The '''hunter-gatherer''' way of life is based on the exploitation of wild plants and animals.  Consequently, hunter-gatherers are relatively mobile, and groups of hunter-gatherers have fluid boundaries and composition. Typically in hunter-gatherer societies men hunt larger wild animals and women gather fruits, nuts, roots, and other edible plant-based food and hunt smaller animals. Hunter-gatherers use materials available in the wild to construct shelters or rely on naturally occurring shelters like overhangs. Their shelters give them protection from predators and the elements.

[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Menna 005.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ancient hunter.]]

The majority of hunter-gatherer societies are nomadic. It is difficult to be settled under such a subsistence system as the resources of one region can quickly become exhausted. Hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have very low population densities as a result of their subsistence system. Agricultural subsistence systems can support population densities 60 to 100 times greater than land left uncultivated, resulting in denser populations.

Hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have non-hierarchical social structures, though this is not always the case.  Because hunter-gatherers tend to be nomadic, they generally do not have the possibility to store surplus food.  As a result, full-time leaders, bureaucrats, or artisans are rarely supported by hunter-gatherer societies. The hierarchical egalitarianism in hunter-gatherer societies tends to extend to gender-based egalitarianism as well. Although disputed, many anthropologists believe gender egalitarianism in hunter-gatherer societies stems from the lack of control over food production, lack of food surplus (which can be used for control), and an equal gender contribution to kin and cultural survival.

Archeological evidence to date suggests that prior to 13,000BCE, all human beings were hunter-gatherers. While declining in number, there are still some hunter-gatherer groups in existence today. Such groups are found in the Arctic, tropical rainforests, and deserts where other forms of subsistence production are impossible or too costly. In most cases these groups do not have a continuous history of hunting and gathering; in many cases their ancestors were agriculturalists who were pushed into marginal areas as a result of migrations and wars.  Examples of hunter-gatherer groups still in existence include: 

*[[w:Sentinelese people|Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands (near India)]]

The line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies is not clear cut.  Many hunter-gatherers consciously manipulate the landscape through cutting or burning useless (to them) plants to encourage the growth and success of those they consume.  Most agricultural people also tend to do some hunting and gathering.  Some agricultural groups farm during the temperate months and hunt during the winter.

===Pastoralist===
[[Image:The Nomads Simple Life (266139764).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Iranian nomads in 2006.]]

A '''pastoralist''' society is a society in which the primary means of subsistence is domesticated livestock.  It is often the case that, like hunter-gatherers, pastoralists are nomadic, moving seasonally in search of fresh pastures and water for their animals. Employment of a pastoralist subsistence system often results in greater population densities and the development of both social hierarchies and divisions in labor as it is more likely there will be a surplus of food.  

Pastoralist societies still exist.  For instance, in Australia, the vast semi-arid areas in the interior of the country contain pastoral runs called sheep stations. These areas may be thousands of square kilometers in size. The number of livestock allowed in these areas is regulated in order to reliably sustain them, providing enough feed and water for the stock. Other examples of pastoralists societies still in existence include:
*[[w:Maasai people|the Maasai of Kenya]]
*[[w:Borana Oromo people|the Borana Oromo of southern Ethiopia]]
*[[w:Turkana people|the Turkana of Kenya]]
*[[w:Bedouin|the Bedouin of Northern Africa]]

===Horticulturalist===
'''Horticulturalist''' societies are societies in which the primary means of subsistence is the cultivation of crops using hand tools.  Like pastoral societies, the cultivation of crops increases population densities and, as a result of food surpluses, allows for a division of labor in society.  

Horticulture differs from agriculture in that agriculture employs animals, machinery, or some other non-human means to facilitate the cultivation of crops while horticulture relies solely on humans for crop cultivation.

===Agrarian===
[[Image:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A tractor ploughing an alfalfa field circa 1921.]]

[[Image:Pineapple 230.gif|right|thumb|250px|A pineapple farmer in Ghana.]]

'''Agrarian''' societies are societies in which the primary means of subsistence is the cultivation of crops using a mixture of human and non-human means (i.e., animals and/or machinery). '''Agriculture''' is the process of producing food, feed, fiber, and other desired products by the cultivation of plants and the raising of domesticated animals (livestock). ''Agriculture'' can refer to subsistence agriculture or industrial agriculture.

'''Subsistence agriculture''' is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the agriculturalist and his/her family.  Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seed native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield. Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations. 

In developed nations a person using such simple techniques on small patches of land would generally be referred to as a gardener; activity of this type would be seen more as a hobby than a profession. Some people in developed nations are driven into such primitive methods by poverty. It is also worth noting that large scale organic farming is on the rise as a result of a renewed interest in non-genetically modified and pesticide free foods. 

In developed nations, a ''farmer'' or ''industrial agriculturalist'' is usually defined as someone with an ownership interest in crops or livestock, and who provides labor or management in their production.  Farmers obtain their financial income from the cultivation of land to yield crops or the commercial raising of animals (animal husbandry), or both.  Those who provide only labor but not management and do not have ownership are often called ''farmhands'', or, if they supervise a leased strip of land growing only one crop, as ''sharecroppers''.

Agriculture allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of surplus, specialization, advanced technology, hierarchical social structures, inequality, and standing armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;/&gt;

====Development of Horticulture and Agriculture====
Horticulture and agriculture as types of subsistence developed among humans somewhere between 10,000 and 8,000 B.C.E. in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price2000&quot;&gt;Price, T. Douglas [ed.]. 2000. Europe's First Farmers. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521665728&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1996&quot;&gt;Harris, David R. [ed.]. 1996. The Origins and Spread of Agriculture in Eurasia. UCL Press. ISBN 1560986751&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons for the development of horticulture and agriculture are debated but may have included climate change and the accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift-giving. Most certainly there was a gradual transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild. In addition to the emergence of farming in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture appeared by at least 6,800 B.C.E. in East Asia (rice) and, later, in Central and South America (maize and squash). Small scale agriculture also likely arose independently in early Neolithic contexts in India (rice) and Southeast Asia (taro).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;&gt;Diamond, Jared. 2005. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. 1st ed. W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full dependency on domestic crops and animals (i.e. when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet) did not occur until the Bronze Age. If the operative definition of ''agriculture'' includes large scale intensive cultivation of land, i.e., mono-cropping, organised irrigation, and use of a specialized labor force, the title &quot;inventors of agriculture&quot; would fall to the Sumerians, starting around 5,500 B.C.E. 

By the early 1800s agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before, especially in the largely virgin lands of North and South America.

====Agriculture Today====
In the world, the use of crop breeding, better management of soil nutrients, and improved weed control have greatly increased yields per unit area.  At the same time, the use of mechanization has decreased labor input. The developing world generally produces lower yields, having less of the latest science, capital, and technology base.  More people in the world are involved in agriculture as their primary economic activity than in any other, yet it only accounts for four percent of the world's GDP.  The rapid rise of mechanization in the 20th century, especially in the form of the tractor, reduced the necessity of humans performing the demanding tasks of sowing, harvesting, and threshing. With mechanization, these tasks could be performed with a speed and on a scale barely imaginable before. These advances have resulted in a substantial increase in the yield of agricultural techniques that have also translated into a decline in the percentage of populations in developed countries that are required to work in agriculture to feed the rest of the population.  As the pie chart below indicates, less than 2% of Americans are employed in agriculture today and produce sufficient food to feed the other 98% of Americans.

[[File:Percent in agriculture - US.png||thumb|center|500px|Percent of the U.S. population employed in agriculture by Census District. Source: US Census 2000.]]

===Industrial===
[[File:Steenfabriek, Tolkamer, Netherlands.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A brick factory in the Netherlands is an example of industry.]]

An '''industrial society''' is a society in which the primary means of subsistence is ''industry''.  Industry is a system of production focused on mechanized manufacturing of goods.  Like agrarian societies, industrial societies increase food surpluses, resulting in more developed hierarchies and significantly more division of labor.  

The division of labor in industrial societies is often one of the most notable elements of the society and can even function to re-organize the development of relationships.  Whereas relationships in pre-industrial societies were more likely to develop through contact at one's place of worship or through proximity of housing, industrial society brings people with similar occupations together, often leading to the formation of friendships through one's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;DurkheimandCoser1997&quot;/&gt;

When capitalised, The Industrial Revolution refers to the first known industrial revolution, which took place in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.  What is some times referred to as The Second Industrial Revolution describes later, somewhat less dramatic changes resulting from the widespread availability of electric power and the internal-combustion engine. Many developing nations began industrialisation under the influence of either the United States or the USSR during the Cold War.

Today, industry makes up only a relatively small percentage of highly developed countries' workforce (see the pie chart above), in large part due to advanced mechanization.  The use of machines and robots to facilitate manufacturing reduces the number of people required to work in industry by increasing their efficiency.  As a result, a single worker can produce substantially more goods in the same amount of time today than they used to be able to produce.  This has also resulted in a transition in most highly developed countries into a post-industrial or service-oriented economy.

===Post-Industrial===
A '''post-industrial society''' is a society in which the primary means of subsistence is derived from service-oriented work, as opposed to agriculture or industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell1973&quot;&gt;Bell, D. (1973). The Coming of Post-Industrial Society : a Venture in Social Forecasting. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note here that the term ''post-industrial'' is still debated in part because it is the current state of society; it is difficult to name a phenomenon while it is occurring. 

Post-industrial societies are often marked by: 
*an increase in the size of the service sector or jobs that perform services rather than creating goods (industry)
*either the outsourcing of or extensive use of mechanization in manufacturing
*an increase in the amount of information technology, often leading to an Information Age 
*information, knowledge, and creativity are seen as the new raw materials of the economy

Most highly developed countries are now post-industrial in that the majority of their workforce works in service-oriented industries, like finance, healthcare, education, business or sales, rather than in industry or agriculture.  This is the case in the U.S., as depicted in the pie chart above.

''Post-industrial society'' is occasionally used critically by individuals seeking to restore or return to industrial development.  Increasingly, however, individuals and communities are viewing abandoned factories as sites for new housing and shopping. Capitalists are also realizing the recreational and commercial development opportunities such locations offer.

===The Implications of Societal Development===
[[File:Societal development.png|thumb|right|400px|The stages of societal development.]]

As noted throughout the above discussion of societal development, changes in the social structure of a society - in this case the primary means of subsistence - also affect other aspects of society.  For instance, as hunters and gatherers make the transition into pastoralism and horticulture, they also develop a surplus in food stuffs.  While it is common for people in the developed world today to have lots of surplus food, we rarely consider just how important that extra food is.  To begin with, once a society has surplus food, that means more of their children will survive into adulthood.  Additionally, as food yields increase in agricultural societies, smaller percentages of the population are required to produce the food for the rest of the population.  This frees up those people not engaged in food production to specialize in other areas, like clothing or housing production.  This results in specialists: some people become experts in growing crops or raising livestock while others become experts in clothing production, metal-working, home construction, etc.  That specialization leads to rapid increases in technology as people are freed from having to spend the majority of their time finding or growing their food and can then spend their time improving at their speciality.  The relationship between surplus and technology may not seem obvious, initially, but surplus is clearly the forerunner of technological development.

This is illustrated in the diagram to the right.  The diagram shows societal development along the top and the implications of societal development along the bottom.  The arrows running between the two rows illustrate the fact that these relationships are very complex.  For instance, specialization not only results from agriculture but also from denser populations and surplus and helps spur industry.  The point being, these are interdependent aspects of societal development that co-evolve.

One additional outcome of surplus that is included in the diagram is ''inequality.''  Inequality will be discussed in much greater detail later in this book, but it is important to note that as soon as there is surplus, there will be greater surplus for some people.  Those with more surplus have an economic advantage relative to those with less surplus as they have greater bargaining power - et voilà, social inequality is born.

==Classical Views on Social Change==
As Western societies transitioned from pre-industrial economies based primarily on agriculture to industrialized societies in the 19th century, some people worried about the impacts such changes would have on society and individuals.  Three early sociologists, Weber, Marx, and Durkheim, perceived different impacts of the Industrial Revolution on the individual and society and described those impacts in their work.  

===Weber and Rationalization===
Max Weber was particularly concerned about the rationalization and bureaucratization of society stemming from the Industrial Revolution and how these two changes would affect humanity's agency and happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1997&quot;&gt;Weber, Max. 1997. The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Weber understood society, particularly during the industrial revolution of the late 19th century in which he lived, society was being driven by the passage of rational ideas into culture which, in turn, transformed society into an increasingly bureaucratic entity. ''Bureaucracy'' is a type of organizational or institutional management that is, as Weber understood it, rooted in legal-rational authority. Bureaucracy is a complex means of managing life in social institutions that includes rules and regulations, patterns and procedures that both are designed to simplify the functioning of complex organizations.  An example of bureaucracy would be the forms used to pay one's income taxes - they require specific information and procedures to fill them out.  Included in that form, however, are countless rules and laws the dictate what can and can't be tied into one's taxes.  Thus, bureaucracy simplifies the process of paying one's taxes by putting the process into a formulaic structure, but simultaneously complicates it by adding rules and regulations that govern the procedure.  Weber did believe bureaucracy was the most rational form of institutional governance, but because Weber viewed rationalization as the driving force of society, he believed bureaucracy would increase until it ruled society. Society, for Weber, would become almost synonymous with bureaucracy.

As Weber did not see any alternative to bureaucracy, he believed it would ultimately lead to an ''iron cage'': there would be no way to get out of it. Weber viewed this as a bleak outcome that would affect individuals' happiness as they would be forced to function in a highly rational society with rigid rules and norms without the possibility to change it. Because Weber could not envision other forces influencing the ultimate direction of society - the exception being temporary lapses into non-bureaucracy spurred by charismatic leaders - he saw no cure for the iron cage of rationality. Society would become a large bureaucracy that would govern people's lives. Weber was unable to envision a solution to his ''iron cage of bureaucracy'' dilemma. Since a completely rational society was inevitable and bureaucracy was the most rational form of societal management, the iron cage, according to Weber, does not have a solution.

===Marx and Alienation===
Karl Marx took a different perspective on the impact of the Industrial Revolution on society and the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx1906&quot;&gt;Marx, Karl. 1906. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy. Modern Library Giant. The Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand Marx's perspective, however, it is necessary to understand how Marx perceived ''happiness''. According to Marx, ''[[w:species being|species being]]'' (or happiness) is the pinnacle of human nature. Species being is understood to be a type of self-realization or self-actualization brought about by meaningful work. But in addition to engaging in meaningful work, self-actualized individuals must also own the products of their labors and have the option of doing what they will with those products.

In a capitalist society (which was co-evolved with the Industrial Revolution), rather than owning the fruits of their labors, the proletariat or working class owns only their labor power, not the fruits of their labors (i.e., the results of production). The capitalists or bourgeoisie employ the proletariat for a living wage, but then keep the products of the labor. As a result, the proletariat is alienated from the fruits of its labor – they do not own the products they produce, only their labor power. Because Marx believed species being to be the goal and ideal of human nature and that species being could only be realized when individuals owned the results of their labors, Marx saw capitalism as leading toward increasingly unhappy individuals; they would be alienated from the results of their production and therefore would not be self-realized.

But the alienation from the results of their production is just one component of the alienation Marx proposed.  In addition to the alienation from the results of production, the proletariat is also alienated from each other under capitalism. Capitalists alienate the proletariat from each other by forcing them to compete for limited job opportunities. Job opportunities are limited under capitalism in order for capitalists to keep wages down; without a pool of extraneous workers, capitalists would have to meet the wage demands of their workers. Because they are forced to compete with other members of the proletariat, workers are alienated from each other, compounding the unhappiness of the proletariat.

While Marx did have a solution to the problem of alienation, he seldom discussed it in detail. Marx's proposed solution was for the proletariat to unite and through protests or revolution (or legislation in democratic nations) overthrow the bourgeoisie and institute a new form of government – communism. This form of government would be based on communally owned and highly developed means of production and self-governance. The means of production would be developed – through capitalism – to the point that everyone in society would have sufficient 'free' time to allow them to participate in whatever governmental decisions needed to be made for the community as a whole. By re-connecting the individual with the fruits of their labor and empowering them toward true self-governance, ''species being'' would be realized and happiness would be returned.

Two additional comments are in order here. First, the economic systems that developed in The Soviet Union and China - as well as other parts of the world - was not the communism envisioned by Marx. Rather, they had achieved a form of socialism, what Marx called the stage between capitalism and communism. Second, Marx believed capitalism, while harmful to ''species being'', was necessary to advance the means of production to a stage where communism (as he envisioned it) could be realized. Thus, while Marx was highly critical of capitalism, he also recognized its utility in developing the means of production.

===Durkheim and Solidarity===
Durkheim's view of society and the changes it was undergoing as a result of industrialization also led him to believe unhappiness was a possible outcome. Durkheim believed that an important component of social life was social solidarity, which is understood as ''a sense of community''. In his classic study, ''Suicide'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1997&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1997. Suicide. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim argued that one of the root causes of suicide was a decrease in social solidarity – termed ''anomie'' (French for ''chaos'') by Durkheim. Durkheim also argued that the increasing emphasis on individualism found in Protestant religions – in contrast to Catholicism – contributed to an increase in anomie, which resulted in higher suicide rates among Protestants.

In another work, ''The Division of Labor in Society'',&lt;ref name=&quot;DurkheimandCoser1997&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile, and Lewis A. Coser. 1997. The Division of Labor in Society. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim proposed that pre-industrial societies maintained their social solidarity through a mechanistic sense of community and through their religious affiliations. Most people were generalists in their work – they farmed and created their own tools and clothing. Because they were alike in their generality, they were also more likely to share a sense of community, which Durkheim saw as an important component of happiness. In addition to their similarity in occupations, many individuals belonged to the same religious groups, which also fostered a sense of solidarity.

In industrializing societies, Durkheim recognized the inevitability of ''specialization''. By definition, specialization means that individuals are going to have dissimilar occupations. This specialization would also affect religion. In industrial societies, religion would become just one aspect of lives that were increasingly divided into compartments – home, family, work, recreation, religion, etc.

Durkheim believed there were two components that would alleviate the decreasing social solidarity in industrializing societies: organic solidarity and conscientious attempts to find camaraderie through one's place of employment. Whereas social solidarity was maintained in pre-industrial societies through a mechanistic sense of similarity and dependence along with communal religious affiliations, in industrialized societies, social solidarity would be maintained by the interdependence of specialists on one another. If one individual specialized in treating the injured or ill, they would not have time to raise crops or otherwise produce food. Doctors would become dependent on farmers for their food while farmers would become dependent on doctors for their healthcare. This would force a type of organic solidarity — organic in the sense that the parts were interdependent like the organs of an animal are interdependent for their survival.

In addition to the inevitable interdependence a specialized society would warrant, Durkheim believed that a conscientious effort to develop and foster friendships would transition from a religious brotherhood to friendships developed at one's place of employment. Specialized individuals would have a great deal in common with their co-workers and, like members of the same religious congregations in pre-industrial societies, co-workers would be able to develop strong bonds of social solidarity through their occupations. Thus, for Durkheim, the answer to the decrease in mechanistic solidarity and the increasing anomie was organic solidarity and solidarity pursued within one's speciality occupation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Culture.png|400px|thumb|right|These two avatars illustrate the basic concept of culture.  One is simply a reflection of his biology; he is human.  The other is a reflection of his biology and his culture; he is human and belongs to a cultural group.]]

==Introduction==

The simplest way to think about culture is to think about the distinction between [[w:Nature (innate)|nature]] (our [[w:biology|biology]] and [[w:genetics|genetics]]) and [[w:Nature_versus_nurture|nurture]] (our environment and surroundings that also shape our identities).  Because of our biology and genetics, we have a particular form and we have certain abilities.  But our biological nature does not exclusively determine who we are.  For that, we need culture.  Culture is the non-biological or social aspects of human life, basically anything that is learned by humans is part of culture.

The two avatars to the right help illustrate this idea.  The avatar wearing nothing but shorts comes close to representing nothing but nature.  The form of the avatar reveals several things about this person, but they are not necessarily tied to a specific culture.  For instance, the fact that he has lighter colored skin suggests he has Caucasian ancestry, but that is biological, not social.  Otherwise, there is very little about this avatar that reflects culture (the exceptions are his shorts and hair stylings, which do, in fact, reflect culture).  The avatar wearing the colorful vest and pants stands in stark contrast to the other avatar.  This second avatar is reflective of a particular culture.  The colors of the vest - red, white, and blue - in the specific pattern they are in (stars and stripes) suggests this avatar is in some way associated with the United States of America.  The cut of the avatar's top and pants suggest a particular time period - the late 1960s or early 1970s.  The backdrop, with the words [[w:Rock the Vote|Rock the Vote]] scrawled across it, also suggest something about the avatar - perhaps that he is a musician participating in the Rock the Vote movement.  Additionally, the avatar's hairstyle, [[w:dreadlocks|dreadlocks]], also suggest something about this second avatar as dreadlocks are prominent only in certain sub-cultures.  In short, the first avatar is mostly a-cultural or lacking in culture while the second avatar is heavily enmeshed in culture.

Generally speaking, the following elements of social life are considered to be representative of human culture: &quot;stories, beliefs, media, ideas, works of art, religious practices, fashions, rituals, specialized knowledge, and common sense&quot; (p. xvi).&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;&gt;Griswold, Wendy. 2004. Cultures and Societies in a Changing World. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, examples of culture do not, in themselves, present a clear understanding of the concept of culture; culture is more than the object or behavior. Culture also includes,

:…norms, values, beliefs, or expressive symbols. Roughly, norms are the way people behave in a given society, values are what they hold dear, beliefs are how they think the universe operates, and expressive symbols are representations, often representations of social norms, values, and beliefs themselves. (p. 3)&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;

To summarize, culture encompasses objects and symbols, the meaning given to those objects and symbols, and the norms, values, and beliefs that pervade social life. &quot;The definition is understood to include two elements - that which differentiates one group or society from others and the concept of acquired or learned behavior&quot;. (p. 43)&lt;ref name=&quot;Gusfield2006&quot;&gt;Gusfield, Joseph R. Culture. Contexts. 2006; 5(1):43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keep in mind that, in any given society, culture is not necessarily rigid and totally uniform.  As is the case with most elements of social life, culture is relatively stable (thus it is functional in the structural-functionalist sense) but at the same time contested (in the conflict sense).&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler2008&quot;&gt;Butler, Judith. 2008. “Sexual politics, torture, and secular time.” The British Journal of Sociology 59:1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;s&gt;Culture is in flux, especially in our modern world in which different cultures are in constant contact with each other.&lt;/s&gt;

==='High' Culture===
[[Image:Jeziorolabedzie.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Ballet, traditionally considered ''high'' culture.]]

Many people today think of ''culture'' in the way that it was thought of in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries.  This concept of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world.  This understanding of culture equates ''culture'' with ''civilization'' and contrasts both with ''nature'' or non-civilization.  According to this understanding of culture, some countries are more civilized than others, and some people are more cultured than others.  Theorists like Matthew Arnold (1822-1888) believed that culture is simply that which is created by &quot;the best that has been thought and said in the world&quot; (p. 6).&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold1882&quot;&gt;Arnold, Matthew, Culture and Anarchy, 1882. Macmillan and Co., New York. Online at [http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_titlepage.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Anything that doesn't fit into this category is labeled as chaos or anarchy. From this perspective, culture is closely tied to cultivation, which is the progressive refinement of human behavior. 

In practice, ''culture'' referred to [[w:elite|elite]] goods and activities such as [[w:haute cuisine|haute cuisine]], [[w:fashion|high fashion]] or [[w:haute couture|haute couture]], museum-caliber art and classical music. The word ''cultured'' referred to people who knew about and took part in these activities. For example, someone who used ''culture'' in this sense might argue that classical music is more refined than music by working-class people, such as [[w:jazz|jazz]] or the indigenous music traditions of aboriginal peoples.

People who use ''culture'' in this way tend not to use it in the plural. They believe that there are not distinct cultures, each with their own internal logic and values, but rather only a single standard of refinement to which all groups are held accountable. Thus people who differ from those who believe themselves to be ''cultured'' in this sense are not usually understood as ''having a different culture''; they are understood as being ''uncultured''.

===The Changing Concept of Culture===
During the [[w:Romantic era|Romantic Era]], scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with [[w:nationalism|nationalism]], developed a more inclusive notion of culture as ''worldview''.  That is, each ethnic group is characterized by a distinct and incommensurable world view. Although more inclusive, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between ''civilized'' and ''primitive'' or ''tribal'' cultures.

By the late 19th century, [[w:anthropology|anthropologists]] had changed the concept of culture to include a wider variety of societies, ultimately resulting in the concept of culture outlined above - objects and symbols, the meaning given to those objects and symbols, and the norms, values, and beliefs that pervade social life.  

This new perspective has also removed the evaluative element of the concept of culture and instead proposes distinctions rather than rankings between different cultures.  For instance, the ''high'' culture of elites is now contrasted with [[w:Popular culture|''popular'' or ''pop culture'']]. In this sense, ''high'' culture no longer refers to the idea of being ''cultured'', as all people are cultured. ''High'' culture simply refers to the objects, symbols, norms, values, and beliefs of a particular group of people; popular culture does the same.

Most social scientists today reject the ''cultured vs. uncultured'' concept of culture.  Instead, social scientists accept and advocate the definition of culture outlined above as being the &quot;nurture&quot; component of human social life.  Social scientists recognize that non-elites are as cultured as elites (and that non-Westerners are just as civilized); they simply have a different culture.  

====The Origins of Culture====
[[Image:Taipei Eye cropped p1090701.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chinese Opera, a culture tradition quite distinct from European Opera.]]

Attentive to the theory of [[w:evolution|evolution]], anthropologists assumed that all human beings are equally evolved, and the fact that all humans have cultures must in some way be a result of human evolution.  They were also wary of using biological evolution to explain differences between specific cultures - an approach that either was a form of, or legitimized forms of, [[w:racism|racism]].  Anthropologists believed biological evolution produced an inclusive notion of culture, a concept that anthropologists could apply equally to non-literate and literate societies, or to nomadic and to sedentary societies.  They argued that through the course of their evolution, human beings evolved a universal human capacity to classify experiences, and encode and communicate them symbolically. Since these symbolic systems were learned and taught, they began to develop independently of biological evolution (in other words, one human being can learn a belief, value, or way of doing something from another, even if they are not biologically related).  That this capacity for symbolic thinking and social learning is a product of human evolution confounds older arguments about [[w:nature versus nurture|nature versus nurture]].  Thus, [[w:Clifford Geertz|Clifford Geertz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Geertz1973&quot;&gt;Geertz, Clifford. (1973). The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays. New York. ISBN 0465097197.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that human physiology and neurology developed in conjunction with the first cultural activities, and Middleton (1990:17 n.27) concluded that human &quot;''instincts'' were culturally formed.&quot;

This view of culture argues that people living apart from one another develop unique cultures. However, elements of different cultures can easily spread from one group of people to another.  Culture is dynamic and can be taught and learned, making it a potentially rapid form of [[w:adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] to changes in physical conditions.  Anthropologists view culture as not only a product of biological evolution but as a supplement to it; it can be seen as the main means of human adaptation to the natural world. 

This view of culture as a symbolic system with adaptive functions, which varies from place to place, led anthropologists to conceive of different cultures as defined by distinct patterns (or structures) of enduring, although arbitrary, conventional sets of meaning, which took concrete form in a variety of artifacts such as [[w:myth|myths]] and [[w:ritual|rituals]], [[w:tool|tools]], the design of housing, and the planning of villages. Anthropologists thus distinguish between '''material culture''' and '''symbolic culture''', not only because each reflects different kinds of human activity, but also because they constitute different kinds of data that require different methodologies to study.

This view of culture, which came to dominate anthropology between World War I and World War II, implied that each culture was bounded and had to be understood as a whole, on its own terms.  The result is a belief in [[w:cultural relativism|cultural relativism]], which suggests that there are no &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; cultures, just different cultures.

Recent research suggests that human culture has reversed the causal direction suggested above and influence human evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laland2010&quot;&gt;Laland, Kevin N., John Odling-Smee, and Sean Myles. 2010. “How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together.” Nat Rev Genet 11:137-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  One well-known illustration of this is the rapid spread of genetic instructions that left on a gene that produces a protein that allows humans to digest lactose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laland2010&quot;/&gt;  This adaptation spread rapidly in Europe around 4,000 BCE with the domestication of mammals, as humans began harvesting their milk for consumption.  Prior to this adaptation, the gene that produces a protein allowing for the digestion of lactose was switched after children were weaned.  Thus, the change in culture - drinking milk from other mammals - eventually led to changes in human genetics.  Genetics has, therefore, resulted in culture, which is now acting back on genetics.

===Level of Abstraction===
Another element of culture that is important for a clear understanding of the concept is [[w:Abstraction (sociology)|level of abstraction]].  Culture ranges from the concrete, cultural object (e.g., the understanding of a work of art) to micro-level interpersonal interactions (e.g., the socialization of a child by his/her parents) to a macro-level influence on entire societies (e.g., the Puritanical roots of the U.S. that can be used to justify the exportation of democracy – a lá the Iraq War).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wald2003&quot;&gt;Wald, Kenneth D. 2003. Religion and Politics in the United States. Fourth ed. New york: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important when trying to understand the concept of culture to keep in mind that the concept can have multiple levels of meaning.

===The Artificiality of Cultural Categorization===
One of the more important points to understand about culture is that it is an artificial categorization of elements of social life.  As Griswold puts it, 

:There is no such thing as ''culture'' or ''society'' out there in the real world. There are only people who work, joke, raise children, love, think, worship, fight, and behave in a wide variety of ways. To speak of culture as one thing and society as another is to make an analytical distinction between two different aspects of human experience. One way to think of the distinction is that culture designates the expressive aspect of human existence, whereas society designates the relational (and often practical) aspect. (p. 4)&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;

In the above quote, Griswold emphasizes that culture is distinct from society but affirms that this distinction is, like all classifications, artificial.  Humans do not experience culture in a separate or distinct way from society.  Culture and society are truly two-sides of a coin; a coin that makes up social life.  Yet the distinction between the two, while artificial, is useful for a number of reasons.  For instance, the distinction between culture and society is of particular use when exploring how norms and values are transmitted from generation to generation and answering the question of cultural conflict between people of different cultural backgrounds (say, the [[w:Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[w:American|Americans]]).

==Subcultures &amp; Countercultures==
[[File:Trekkies at baycon 2003.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Trekkies (or fans of Star Trek) are a subculture; they share specific understandings and meanings that those outside their subculture may not understand.]]

A '''subculture''' is a culture shared and actively participated in by a minority of people within a broader culture. A culture often contains numerous subcultures. Subcultures incorporate large parts of the broader cultures of which they are part, but in specifics they may differ radically. Some subcultures achieve such a status that they acquire a name of their own. Examples of subcultures could include: [[w:bikers|bikers]], [[w:military of the United States|military culture]], and [[w:Society and Star Trek|Star Trek]] fans ([[w:trekkie|trekkers or trekkies]]).

[[File:Colorado City 8-13-2008 2-06-58 PM.JPG|thumb|150px|right|The woman and children in this photo are members of [[w:The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (or FLDS), which advocates the practice polygamy, making members part of a countercultural group (polygamy is illegal in the United States).]]

A '''counterculture''' is a subculture with the addition that some of its beliefs, values, or norms challenge or even contradict those of the main culture of which it is part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roszak1968&quot;&gt;Roszak, Theodore, The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition, 1968/1969, Doubleday, New York, ISBN 0385073291; ISBN 978-0385073295.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of countercultures in the U.S. could include: [[w:hippie|the hippie movement of the 1960s]], [[w:green movement|the green movement]], [[w:polygamy|polygamists]], and [[w:feminism|and feminist groups]].

Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hebdige1979&quot;&gt;Hebdige, Dick (1979). Subculture: The Meaning of Style (Routledge, March 10, 1981; softcover ISBN 0-415-03949-5).&lt;/ref&gt;  Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members. The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors. Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and [[w:argot|argot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hebdige1979&quot;/&gt;

==Ethnocentrism &amp; Cultural Relativism==
'''Ethnocentrism''' is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one's own culture. Many claim that ethnocentrism occurs in every society; ironically, ethnocentrism may be something that all cultures have in common.

The term was coined by William Graham Sumner, a social evolutionist and professor of Political and Social Science at Yale University. He defined it as, &quot;The sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner1919&quot;&gt;William Graham Sumner, War and Other Essays, ed. Albert Galloway Keller (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnocentrism often entails the belief that one's own race or ethnic group is the most important and/or that some or all aspects of its culture are superior to those of other groups. Within this ideology, individuals will judge other groups in relation to their own particular ethnic group or culture, especially with concern to language, behaviour, customs, and religion. It also involves an incapacity to acknowledge that cultural differentiation does not imply inferiority of those groups who are ethnically distinct from one's own.

Sociologists study ethnocentrism because of its role in various elements of social life, ranging from politics to terrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juergensmeyer2003&quot;&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. 2003. Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence, 3rd Edition. 3rd ed. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also an area where sociologists often become advocates as they attempt to reveal ethnocentric biases to those who hold them with the aim of helping people realize that such biases are seldom beneficial to social solidarity and peaceful human relations.

'''Cultural relativism''' is the belief that the concepts and values of a culture cannot be fully translated into, or fully understood in, other languages; that a specific [[w:cultural artifact|cultural artifact]] (e.g. a ritual) has to be understood in terms of the larger symbolic system of which it is a part.

An example of cultural relativism might include slang words from specific languages (and even from particular dialects within a language).  For instance, the word ''tranquilo'' in Spanish translates directly to 'calm' in English.  However, it can be used in many more ways than just as an adjective (e.g., the seas are calm). Tranquilo can be a command or suggestion encouraging another to ''calm down''.  It can also be used to ease tensions in an argument (e.g., everyone relax) or to indicate a degree of self-composure (e.g., I'm calm). There is not a clear English translation of the word, and in order to fully comprehend its many possible uses a cultural relativist would argue that it would be necessary to fully immerse oneself in cultures where the word is used.

==Theories of Culture==
While there are numerous theoretical approaches employed to understand 'culture', this chapter uses just one model to illustrate how sociologists understand the concept.  The model is an integrationist model advocated by Ritzer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2004&quot;&gt;Ritzer, George and Douglas J. Goodman. 2004. Modern Sociological Theory. sixth ed. Boston, MA: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritzer proposes four highly interdependent elements in his sociological model: a macro-objective component (e.g., society, law, bureaucracy), a micro-objective component (e.g., patterns of behavior and human interaction), a macro-subjective component (e.g., culture, norms, and values), and a micro-subjective component (e.g., perceptions, beliefs).  This model is of particular use in understanding the role of culture in sociological research because it presents two axes for understanding culture: one ranging from objective (society) to subjective (culture and cultural interpretation); the other ranging from the macro-level (norms) to the micro-level (individual level beliefs). 

[[Image:Ritzers integration theory.svg|center|George Ritzer's macro/micro integration theory of social analysis.]]

If used for understanding a specific cultural phenomenon, like the displaying of abstract art,&lt;ref name=&quot;Halle1993&quot;&gt;Halle, David. 1993. Inside Culture: Art and Class in the American Home. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this model depicts how cultural norms can influence individual behavior.  This model also posits that individual level values, beliefs, and behaviors can, in turn, influence the macro-level culture.  This is, in fact, part of what David Halle finds: while there are certainly cultural differences based on class, they are not unique to class.  Displayers of abstract art tend not only to belong to the upper-class, but also are employed in art-production occupations.  This would indicate that there are multiple levels of influence involved in art tastes – both broad cultural norms and smaller level occupational norms in addition to personal preferences.

===The Function of Culture===
Culture can also be seen to play a specific function in social life.  According to Griswold, &quot;The sociological analysis of culture begins at the premise that culture provides orientation, wards off chaos, and directs behavior toward certain lines of action and away from others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;  Griswold reiterates this point by explaining that, &quot;Groups and societies need collective representations of themselves to inspire sentiments of unity and mutual support, and culture fulfills this need.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt; In other words, culture can have a certain utilitarian function – the maintenance of order as the result of shared understandings and meanings.

==Cultural Change==
The belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. Resistance can come from habit, religion, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;&gt;Emerson, Michael O., and Christian Smith. 2001. Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, men and women have complementary roles in many cultures. One sex might desire changes that affect the other, as happened in the second half of the 20th century in western cultures (see, for example, the [[w:feminist movement|women's movement]]), while the other sex may be resistant to that change (possibly in order to maintain a power imbalance in their favor).

[[File:Ankh-Mirror-TutanchamunTomb.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The symbol of the ankh has its roots in Egyptian religious practice, but the symbol diffused over time and was adopted by other groups, including pagans, as a religious symbol.]]

Cultural change can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures. For example, the end of the last ice age helped lead to the invention of agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;&gt;Diamond, Jared. 2005. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. 1st ed. W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; An invention that substantially changed culture was the development of the [[w:birth control pill|birth control pill]], which changed women's attitudes toward sex.  Prior to the introduction of the birth control pill, women were at a high risk of pregnancy as a result of sex.  After the introduction of the pill, their risk of pregnancy was substantially reduced, increasing their willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of wedlock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the introduction of the television substantially reduced American involvement in civic life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several understandings of how cultures change come from Anthropology.  For instance, in [[w:diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion theory]], the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the [[w:Ankh|ankh symbol]] originated in Egyptian culture but has diffused to numerous cultures.  It's original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of [[w:New Age|New Age Religion]] as an arcane symbol of power or life forces.

Contact between cultures can also result in [[w:acculturation|acculturation]]. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened with many [[w:Native American|Native American Indians]] as Europeans took over their lands. Many Native Americans were acculturated into European cultural norms, from religion to how to raise children.  Related processes on an individual level are [[w:assimilation|assimilation]] and [[w:transculturation|transculturation]], both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual.

Griswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt; Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals, but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture.  The author presents a sociological perspective to address this conflict,

:Sociology suggests an alternative to both the unsatisfying ''it has always been that way'' view at one extreme and the unsociological ''individual genius'' view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations.  We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p. 53)  

Griswold suggests, then, that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture.  The logic is a bit circular, but it illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.

It is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, &quot;there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was&quot;).  Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society.  This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue.  Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural beings).  Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leakey1996&quot;&gt;Leakey, Richard. 1996. The Origin of Humankind. New York: BasicBooks.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning.  This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do.

==Cultural Sociology: Researching Culture==
How do sociologists study culture?  One approach to studying culture falls under the label 'cultural sociology', which combines the study of culture with cultural understandings of phenomena. Griswold explains how cultural sociologists approach their research, 

:...if one were to try to understand a certain group of people, one would look for the expressive forms through which they represent themselves to themselves... The sociologist can come at this collective representation process from the other direction, from the analysis of a particular cultural object, as well; if we were to try to understand a cultural object, we would look for how it is used by some group as representing that group. (p. 59)&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;

Cultural sociologists look for how people make meaning in their lives out of the different cultural elements that surround them. A particularly clear example of cultural sociology is the study of the Village-Northton by Elijah Anderson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson1990&quot;&gt;Anderson, Elijah. 1990. Streetwise: Race, Class, and Change in an Urban Community. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anderson is interested in a number of things in his book, but two cultural components stand out.  First, Anderson is looking at the border of two culturally and socio-economically distinct neighborhoods.  Because these two neighborhoods are distinct yet share a border, this research site provides numerous opportunities for the exploration of culture.  Not surprisingly, cultural conflict is an optimal scenario for the exploration of culture and cultural interaction.  Additionally, Anderson is interested in how individuals in these neighborhoods negotiate interpersonal interactions, especially when individuals from the Village (middle to upper-middle class and predominantly white) are forced to interact with members of the Northton area (lower class and poor blacks).  

Anderson’s methodology is a combination of participant observation and interviews.  But when viewed in light of the quote above by Griswold, it becomes apparent that Anderson’s focus in these interviews and observations is [[w:self-presentation|self-presentation]].  Anderson regularly describes the individuals he interviews and observes in light of their clothing, behavior, attitudes, beliefs, and opinions.  As he interacts with more and more individuals, patterns begin to develop.  Specifically, individuals dressed in certain outfits behave in similar ways.  For instance, those dressed in business attire (even when walking their dogs) – [[w:yuppie|the yuppies]] – have particular perspectives on the future of the Village: they are interested in increasing property values in order to maximize their investment.  Another example of cultural significance of clothing is older black men who intentionally wear button-up shirts and ties because of the cultural symbolism of that particular outfit: it signifies to the cultural outsider that the wearer is refined and distinct from the athletic-suit-wearing drug dealers who control numerous Northton corners.

Ultimately, Anderson’s goal is to develop a sort of typology of ''streetwise'' individuals: people who can manage awkward and uncomfortable interpersonal interactions on the street in such a fashion that they emerge from the interactions unharmed.  While he does develop a loose description of these types of individuals, the important part to understand here is how he explores these aspects of culture.  First, he found a cultural border that presented cultural conflict.  When individuals have to negotiate meaning publicly, it makes it much easier for the sociologist to tease out culture.  Additionally, Anderson observed both the transmission of culture from generation to generation (i.e., [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|socialization]], but also the self-representation that is provided by cultural expressions (clothing, behavior, etc).  Through years of observation, Anderson gained a familiarity with these elements of culture that allowed him to understand how they interacted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Elements of Socialization==
Socialization is a fundamental sociological concept, comprising a number of elements.  While not every sociologist will agree which elements are the most important, or even how to define some of the elements of socialization, the elements outlined below should help clarify what is meant by socialization. 

===Goals of Socialization===
[[Image:AF-kindergarten.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A kindergarten in Afghanistan.]]

Arnett,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnett1995&quot;&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey J. 1995. Broad and Narrow Socialization: The Family in the Context of a Cultural Theory. ''Journal of Marriage and the Family'' 57( 3):617-28.&lt;/ref&gt; in presenting a new theoretical understanding of socialization (see below), outlined what he believes to be the three goals of socialization:
#impulse control and the development of a [[w:conscience|conscience]]
#role preparation and performance, including occupational roles, gender roles, and roles in institutions such as marriage and parenthood
#the cultivation of sources of meaning, or what is important, valued, and to be lived for

In short, socialization is the process that prepares humans to function in social life.  It should be re-iterated here that socialization is culturally relative - people in different cultures are socialized differently.  This distinction does not and should not inherently force an evaluative judgement. Socialization, because it is the adoption of culture, is going to be different in every culture. Socialization, as both process or an outcome, is not better or worse in any particular culture.

It should also be noted that, while socialization is a key sociological process in the development of individuals who can function in human society, not every aspect of human behavior is learned.  For instance, there is evidence that most children have innate empathy for individuals who are wilfully injured and consider it wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot; &quot;&gt;Decety, Jean, Kalina J. Michalska, and Yuko Akitsuki. 2008. Who caused the pain? An fMRI Investigation of Empathy and Intentionality in Children. Neuropsychologia. 46, 11:2607-2614.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, some aspects of human behavior that one might believe are learned, like empathy and morals, may, in fact, be biologically determined.  To what extent human behavior is biologically determined vs. learned is still an open question in the study of human behavior.

===Primary and Secondary Socialization===
Socialization is a life process, but is generally divided into two parts: ''Primary socialization'' takes place early in life, as a child and adolescent. ''Secondary socialization'' refers to the socialization that takes place throughout one's life, both as a child and as one encounters new groups that require additional socialization.  While there are scholars who argue that only one or the other of these occurs, most social scientists tend to combine the two, arguing that the basic or core identity of the individual develops during primary socialization, with more specific changes occurring later - secondary socialization - in response to the acquisition of new group memberships and roles and differently structured social situations. The need for later life socialization may stem from the increasing complexity of society with its corresponding increase in varied roles and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;/&gt;

Mortimer and Simmons outline three specific ways these two parts of socialization differ:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;/&gt;
#content - Socialization in childhood is thought to be concerned with the regulation of biological drives. In adolescence, socialization is concerned with the development of overarching values and the self-image. In adulthood, socialization involves more overt and specific norms and behaviors, such as those related to the work role as well as more superficial personality features.
#context - In earlier periods, the ''socializee'' (the person being socialized) more clearly assumes the status of ''learner'' within the context of the family of orientation, the school, or the peer group. Also, relationships in the earlier period are more likely to be affectively charged, i.e., highly emotional. In adulthood, though the socializee takes the role of student at times, much socialization occurs after the socializee has assumed full incumbency of the adult role. There is also a greater likelihood of more formal relationships due to situational contexts (e.g., work environment), which moderates down the affective component.
#response - The child and adolescent may be more easily malleable than the adult. Also, much adult socialization is self-initiated and voluntary; adults can leave or terminate the process at any time.

Socialization is, of course, a social process.  As such, it involves interactions between people.  Socialization, as noted in the distinction between primary and secondary, can take place in multiple contexts and as a result of contact with numerous groups. Some of the more significant contributors to the socialization process are: parents, friends, schools, siblings, and co-workers. Each of these groups include a culture that must be learned and to some degree appropriated by the socializee in order to gain admittance to the group.

===Broad and Narrow Socialization===
Arnett proposed an interesting though seldom used distinction in types of socialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnett1995&quot;/&gt;  Arnett distinguishes between broad and narrow socialization:
*broad socialization is intended to promote independence, individualism, and self-expression; it is dubbed ''broad'' because this type of socialization has the potential of resulting in a broad range of outcomes
*narrow socialization is intended to promote obedience and conformity; it is dubbed ''narrow'' because there is a narrow range of outcomes

These distinctions correspond to Arnett's definition of socialization, which is: 
:the whole process by which an individual born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined with a much narrower range; the range of what is customary and acceptable for him according to the standards of his group

Arnett explains that his understanding of socialization should not be understood as having just two options, broad or narrow. Instead, the author argues that socialization can be broad or narrow within each of the seven socializing forces he outlines (e.g., family, friends, etc.).  Because each force can be either broad or narrow, there is a wide variety of possible broad/narrow socialization combinations.  Finally, Arnett notes two examples where his distinction is relevant.  First, Arnett argues that there are often differences in socialization by gender. Where these differences exist, argues Arnett, socialization tends to be narrower for women than for men.  Arnett also argues that Japanese socialization is narrow as there is more pressure toward conformity in that culture. Arnett argues that this may account for the lower crime rates in Japan.

===Total Institutions===
[[Image:Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow 002.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A painting of a prison.]]

Not all socialization is voluntary nor is all socialization successful.  There are components of society designed specifically to resocialize individuals who were not successfully socialized to begin with.  For instance, prisons and mental health institutions are designed to resocialize people who are deemed to have not been successfully socialized.  Depending on the degree of isolation and resocialization that takes place in a given institution, some of these institutions are labeled ''total institutions''.  In his classic study of total institutions, Erving Goffman gives the following characteristics of total institutions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1961&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1961. ''Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates.''&lt;/ref&gt; 
#all aspects of life are conducted in the same place under the same authority 
#the individual is a member of a large cohort, all treated alike
#all daily activities (over a 24-hour period) are tightly scheduled
#there is a sharp split between supervisors and lower participants
#information about the member's fate is withheld

The most common examples of total institutions include mental hospitals, prisons, and military boot camps, though there are numerous other institutions that could be considered total institutions as well. The goal of total institutions is to facilitate a complete break with one's old life in order for the institution to resocialize the individual into a new life.

Mortimer and Simmons note a difference in socialization methodologies in different types of institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;/&gt;  When the goal of an institution is socialization (primary or secondary), the institution tends to use normative pressures. When the goal of an institution is resocialization of deviants, [[w:coercion|coercion]] is frequently involved.

===The Importance of Socialization===
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or wilful abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.  Such children are called &quot;[[w:Feral child|feral]]&quot; or wild.  Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment. Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away. Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own. When completely brought up by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular care-animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans. 

Feral children lack the basic social skills which are normally learned in the process of socialization. For example, they may be unable to learn to use a toilet, have trouble learning to walk upright and display a complete lack of interest in the human activity around them. They often seem mentally impaired and have almost insurmountable trouble learning a human language. The impaired ability to learn language after having been isolated for so many years is often attributed to the existence of a critical period for language learning, and taken as evidence in favor of the [[w:Critical Period Hypothesis|Critical Period Hypothesis]].  It is very difficult to socialize a child who became isolated at a very young age into a relatively normal member of society and such individuals often need close care throughout their lives.

There are, unfortunately, a number of examples of such children that have been well-documented, including:

St. Petersburg Times. http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/article750838.ece. Retrieved 2008-08-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical Understandings of Socialization==
Socialization, as a concept in social scientific research, has evolved over time. While the basic idea outlined above has been a component of most understandings of socialization, there have been quite a variety of definitions and theories of socialization. Some of these approaches are presented here as definitional variety is often informative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland1970&quot;&gt;Holland, David. 1970. Familization, Socialization, and the Universe of Meaning: An Extension of the Interactional Approach to the Study of the Family. ''Journal of Marriage and the Family'' 32(3):415-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;&gt;Mortimer, Jeylan T. and  Roberta G. Simmons. 1978. Adult Socialization. ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 4:421-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long1985&quot;&gt;Long, Theodore E. and Jeffrey K. Hadden. 1985. A Reconception of Socialization.  ''Sociological Theory'' 3(1):39-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Symbolic Interactionism - the self develops as a result of social interactions; as a result, socialization is highly dependent on the situations in which the actor finds him/herself; this approach also argues that socialization is a continuous, lifelong process
*Role Theory - socialization is seen as a process of acquisition of appropriate norms, attitudes, self-images, values, and role behaviors that enable acceptance in the group and effective performance of new roles; in this framework, socialization is seen as a conservative force, permitting the perpetuation of the social organization in spite of the turn-over of individual members through time
*Reinforcement Theory - the self develops as a result of cognitive evaluations of costs and benefits; this understanding assumes that the socializee, in approaching new roles, is an independent and active negotiator for advantages in relationships with role partners and membership groups
*Internalization Theory - socialization is a series of stages in which the individual learns to participate in various levels of organization of society; this theory contends that the child [[w:internalization|internalizes]] a cognitive frame of reference for interpersonal relations and a common system of expressive symbolism in addition to a moral conscience; this approach was advocated by [[w:Talcott Parsons|Talcott Parsons]]

Recent research&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2010&quot;&gt;Mark Nielsen and Keyan Tomaselli “Overimitation in Kalahari Bushman Children and the Origins of Human Cultural Cognition” in Psychological Science, May 2010, 21: 729-736.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that human children are hard-wired to exactly imitate the roles of adults, including actions that are not pragmatic. This is referred to as &quot;overimitation&quot; and, while seemingly maladaptive from an evolutionary perspective, it is possible that this is one of the characteristics of humans that facilitates the transmission of culture from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2010&quot;/&gt; 

===Socialization as ''Joining Groups''===
Socialization has addressed the problem of individual adjustment to society. In all of the approaches outlined above, socialization has, in one way or another, referred to the idea that society shapes its members toward compliance and cooperation with societal requirements.  In order to reduce confusion, develop a research methodology for measuring socialization, and potentially lead to the comparability of research findings from different studies, Long and Hadden proposed a revised understanding of socialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long1985&quot;/&gt;  Rather than referring to a vague adoption or learning of culture, Long and Hadden reframed socialization as &quot;the medium for transforming newcomers into bona fide members of a group.&quot;  Before discussing some of the specifics of this approach, it may be useful to outline some of the critiques Long and Hadden present of earlier approaches to socialization.

According to Long and Hadden, many earlier approaches to socialization extended socialization to every part of human social life.  As a result, everyone becomes both a socializing agent (socializer) and a novice (socializee) in all encounters with others. This conceptualization leaves socialization without a social home; it is all around but no place in particular.  Another criticism of previous approaches is that they allowed socialization to include anything, and anything which is part of the process at one time may be excluded at another. With this conceptualization, any phenomenon may shift its status in the socialization process without changing its own composition or expression. In other words, socialization includes virtually everything, excludes almost nothing, and shifts with circumstance and outcomes.  Additionally, previous approaches to socialization lacked specificity about the nature of socialization activity. Defining socialization by its outcomes made it unnecessary to stipulate the nature of the process conceptually. Socialization could be attributed to ''this or that'' but in order to truly understand what is taking place it is necessary to go beyond just pointing to socializing agents and specify what it is about those agents that is doing the socializing. Another serious drawback of earlier approaches is that they disregard the ''process'' component of socialization. Doing so limits the socialization concept to employment primarily as a post hoc interpretive category that is used to lend significance to findings defined and developed in other terms.

As a result of these criticisms, Long and Hadden found themselves presented with a two-fold task:&lt;ref name=&quot;Long1985&quot;/&gt;
*locate socialization and its social boundaries more precisely
*specify the distinctive properties which distinguish it from related phenomena

To accomplish this, Long and Hadden developed a new understanding of socialization, &quot;socialization is the process of creating and incorporating new members of a group from a pool of newcomers, carried out by members and their allies&quot;.  Under this understanding, the principal agents of socialization are certified and practicing members of the group to which novices are being socialized. It should be noted that ''certified'' here is only a shortened way of saying &quot;a socially approved member of the group.&quot;  Thus, Long and Hadden's revised understanding of socialization sees it as both the process and outcome of joining groups.

==Research Examples==
Numerous examples of research on socialization could be presented in this section.  One important area of socialization research involves differences in gender socialization, but much of that research is summarized in the chapter on [[Introduction to Sociology/Gender|gender]].  The following three research examples are interesting in that they explore both primary and secondary socialization and do so from varying perspectives.

===Socialization and Social Class===
Ellis, Lee, and Peterson,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis1978&quot;&gt;Ellis, Godfrey J., Gary R. Lee, and Larry R. Petersen. 1978. Supervision and Conformity: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Parental Socialization Values. ''American Journal of Sociology'' 84(2):386-403.&lt;/ref&gt; developing a research agenda begun by Melvin L. Kohn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kohn1969&quot;&gt;Kohn, Melvin L. 1969. ''Class and Conformity, A Study in Values.'' Homewood, IL: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explored differences in how parents raise their children relative to their [[w:social class|social class]]. Kohn found that lower class parents were more likely to emphasize conformity in their children whereas middle-class parents were more likely to emphasize creativity and self-reliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kohn1969&quot;/&gt;  Ellis et. al. proposed and found that parents value conformity over self-reliance in children to the extent that conformity superseded self-reliance as a criterion for success in their own endeavors.  In other words, Ellis et. al. verified that the reason lower-class parents emphasize conformity in their children is because they experience conformity in their day-to-day activities.  For example, factory work is far more about conforming than innovation.

Another study in this same area explored a slightly different component of this relationship.  Erlanger was interested in a correlation between social class and physical violence.{{ref|Erlanger1974}}  While he did not find a strong correlation indicating lower class individuals were more likely to employ physical violence in punishing their children, he did present evidence concerning several outdated propositions.  Erlanger's findings include:
*physical punishment ''does not'' lead to ''working class authoritarianism''
*childhood punishment experiences ''do not'' explain the greater probability that working class adults, as opposed to middle class adults, will commit homicide
*general use of corporal punishment ''is not'' a precursor to child abuse
*use of corporal punishment ''is not'' part of a subcultural positive evaluation of violence

It should be noted that this is an older study and that more recent findings may have shed more light on these issues.  It should also be noted that Erlanger readily points out when his findings are strongly supported or weakly supported by his data.  It behooves the interested party to read his paper directly rather than rely on the summary above for the specific nuances.

===Socialization and Death Preparation===
Marshall interviewed a number of retirement home residents to explore how their environment influenced their thinking about death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall1975&quot;&gt;Marshall, Victor W. 1975. Socialization for Impending Death in a Retirement Village. ''American Journal of Sociology'' 80(5):1124-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, Marshall was examining secondary socialization concerning mortality.  Marshall found that a combination of relationships, behavioral changes, and retirement home culture contributed to a conception of death that was both accepting and courageous.  

Residents of this particular retirement home found themselves with more time on their hands - to think about death - because they no longer had to care for their own homes.  Additionally, they found themselves surrounded by people in a situation similar to their own: they were basically moving into the retirement home to prepare for death.  The prevalence of elderly people facilitated discussions of death, which also helped socialize the residents into their acceptance of mortality.  Finally, the retirement home community encouraged a culture of life and fulfilment in part to counter-act the frequency of death.  Some residents calculated there was one death per week in the retirement home.  In light of such bad numbers, it was important to the success of the community to maintain a positive culture that embraced life yet accepted death.  In summary, Marshall found that numerous factors contributed to the socialization of residents into a positive lifestyle that was also accepting of and preparatory for their impending deaths.

===Do College Preparation Classes Make a Difference?===
Rosenbaum was interested in the effects of high school tracks on [[w:intelligence quotient|IQ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenbaum1975&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum, James E. 1975. The Stratification of Socialization Processes. ''American Sociological Review'' 40(1):48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  High school tracks are the different levels or types of courses students can take; for instance, many high schools now include college preparation tracks and general education tracks.  Rosenbaum's hypothesis was that students who followed the lower tracks (non college-preparation) would score lower on IQ tests over time than would students who followed the higher tracks (college-preparation).  Considering that school is one of the primary contributors to socialization, it makes sense that participation in a given track can also result in the adoption of the norms, values, beliefs, skills, and behaviors that correspond to that track.  In other words, tracks can turn into a type of [[w:self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecy]]: you may start out at the same level as someone in a higher track, but by the time you have completed the lower track you will have become like the other students in your track.

To reduce confounding variables and ensure notable test effects, Rosenbaum selected a homogeneous, white, working class public school with five different, highly stratified classes.  Rosenbaum then compared IQ scores for individuals in the different tracks at two time points.  As it turns out, ''tracking'' does have a significant effect on IQ. People in lower tracks can actually see a decline in IQ compared to a possible increase among those in the upper track.  In other words, tracks socialize their students into their corresponding roles.

Sociologists make a distinction between '''gender''' and '''sex'''.  ''Gender'' is the perceived or projected component of human sexuality while ''sex'' is the [[w:biological|biological]] or genetic component.

Why do sociologists differentiate between gender and sex?  Differentiating gender from sex allows social scientists to study influences on [[w:sexuality|sexuality]] without confusing the social and psychological aspects with the biological and genetic aspects. As discussed below, gender is a [[w:social construction|social construction]].  If a social scientist were to continually talk about the social construction of sex, which biologists understand to be a genetic trait, this could lead to confusion. 

===Sex===
Many [[w:species|species]] of living things are divided into two or more categories called '''sexes'''. These refer to complementary groups that combine genetic material in order to reproduce, a process called [[w:sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]]. Typically, a species will have two sexes: ''male'' and ''female''. The female sex is defined as the one which produces the larger [[w:gamete|gamete]] (i.e., reproductive cell) and which bears the offspring. The categories of sex are, therefore, reflective of the reproductive functions that an individual is capable of performing at some point during its life cycle, and not of the mating types, which genetically can be more than two.

In [[w:Mammalia|mammals]] (and many other species) sex is determined by the sex chromosomes, called X and Y.  For mammals, males typically have one of each (XY), while females typically have two X chromosomes (XX).  All individuals have at least one X chromosome, the Y chromosome is generally shorter than the X chromosome with which it is paired, and is absent in some species. In humans, ''sex'' is conventionally perceived as a dichotomous state or identity for most biological purposes, such that a person can only be ''female'' or ''male''.

===Gender===
Gender is the socially constructed component of human sexuality.  ''Gender'' is an inner feeling that you are male, female, both, neither, or somewhere in between.  Perhaps the best way to understand gender is to understand it as a process of social presentation.  Because [[w:gender role|gender roles]] are delineated by behavioral expectations and norms, once individuals know those expectations and norms, the individual can adopt behaviors that project the gender he/she wishes to portray.  One can think of gender like a role in a theatrical play - there are specific behaviors and norms associated with genders just like there are lines and movements associated with each character in a play.  Adopting the behaviors and norms of a gender leads to the perception that someone belongs in that gender category.  Gender roles are, unlike sex, mutable, meaning they can change.  Gender is not, however, as simple as just choosing a role to play but is also influenced by parents, peers, culture, and society.  

Some examples may help illustrate the distinction between gender and sex. Parents may socialize a biological boy (XY chromosomes) into what is perceived as a traditionally masculine role, that includes characteristics like: independence, courage, and aggressiveness.  Likewise, parents may socialize a biological female (XX chromosomes) into what is perceived as a traditionally feminine role, that includes characteristics like: submissiveness, emotionality, and empathy. Assuming both children feel like their gender roles fit their [[w:identity|identities]], the masculine boy and feminine girl will behave in ways that reflect their genders.  For instance, the boy may play with toy soldiers and join athletic teams.  The girl, on the other hand, may play with dolls and bond with other girls in smaller groups.

However, gender is fluid and can change.  This can be seen by continuing the above example.  It is possible for the boy to decide later in life that he no longer wishes to portray himself as traditionally masculine.  The boy may adopt some traditionally feminine characteristics and become [[w:androgyny|androgynous]], or may adopt a feminine persona altogether (see the photos of cross-dressing drag queens for an example of this type of gender construction).  Either change would involve adopting the behaviors and norms that go along with the intended gender. The same is true for the girl, who may adopt masculine characteristics.

===Gender Discordance===
A significant proportion of the human population does not correspond exclusively to either ''female'' or ''male'' genders or sexes. When gender identity and biological sex conflict, the result is sex ''[[w:discordance|discordance]]''.  Some discordances are purely biological, such as when the sex of the chromosomes (''genetic sex'') does not match the sex of the external genitalia (''anatomic sex''). For more extensive discussion of this type of discordance, see this article on [[w:Intersex|intersex]]. 

[[Image:Dragqueens.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Men dressed in [[w:Drag (clothing)|drag]] in Montreal, Canada.]]

Discordances between the biological (sex) and psychosocial (gender) components of gender, such as when the gender does not match the anatomic sex, are even more common but less well understood. The vast majority of people who are discordant in some aspect of psyche or behavior do not have any detectable biological intersex condition. Human societies respond to, or accommodate, these behavioral and psychological discordances in many different ways, ranging from suppression and denial of difference to acknowledging various forms of ''third sex'' (see the [[w:Kothoey|Kothoey]] pictured above).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bilefsky2008&quot;&gt;Bilefsky, Dan. 2008. “Albanian Custom Fades: Woman as Family Man.” The New York Times, June 25 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/world/europe/25virgins.html (Accessed July 3, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacey2008&quot;&gt;Lacey, Marc. 2008. “A Lifestyle Distinct: The Muxe of Mexico.” The New York Times, December 7 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/weekinreview/07lacey.html (Accessed February 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some societies identify youths with atypical behavioral characteristics and, instead of giving them corrective therapy or punishing them, socialize them in such a way that their individual characteristics let them provide a useful function for the society in a recognized and respected role. Some of the roles these individuals may assume include: [[w:shaman|shaman]], [[w:medicine man|medicine man]], [[w:tong-ki|tong-ki]], [[w:berdache|berdache]], [[w:hijra (India)|hijra]], [[w:xanith|xanith]], and [[w:transgender|transgender]].

Gender discordance leads to the understanding that what we traditionally understand to be feminine and masculine characteristics are social (and cultural) constructions. Some people have sought to define their sexuality and sexual identity in non-polar terms in the belief that the simple division of all humans into ''males'' and ''females'' does not fit their individual conditions. A proponent of this movement away from polar oppositions, [[w:Anne Fausto-Sterling|Anne Fausto-Sterling]], once suggested we recognize five sexes: male, female, merm, ferm and herm. Although quickly rejected as a bizarre flouting of human nature and social reality and inimical to the interests of those whom she was attempting to champion, it expresses the difficulty and imperfection of the current social responses to these variations.

==Biological Differences==
While much of this chapter focuses on the socially constructed differences between men and women, it is also important to note there are some clear [[w:physiology|physiological]] differences between the two sexes.  In addition to different sex organs and sex chromosomes, the average male is 10 percent taller, 20 percent heavier, and 35 percent stronger in the upper body than the average female&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenreich1999&quot;&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara. 1999. &quot;The Real Truth about the Female Body.&quot; Time. Vol. 153, No. 9, pages 56-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that these physiological differences may have been influenced by social/cultural decisions in our evolutionary past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buss2003&quot;&gt;Buss, David M. 2003. The Evolution Of Desire - Revised Edition 4. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, when measured against their own body size, rather than on an absolute scale (e.g., how much women can carry relative to their body size versus how much men can carry relative to their body size), actual strength differences are minimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebben1998&quot;&gt;Ebben, William P. and Randall Jensen. 1998. &quot;Strength Training for Women: myths that block opportunity&quot;. The Physician and Sports Medicine 26(5): np.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women, for reasons still somewhat undetermined, tend to outlive men.  Women's life expectancy in the U.S. is 79.8 years; men's is 74.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/Default.htm U.S. National Center for Health Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe this difference is due to the riskier lifestyles of men, especially earlier in life, combined with their typically more physically stressing occupations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2003&quot;&gt;Williams, David R. 2003. “The Health of Men: Structured Inequalities and Opportunities.” Am J Public Health 93:724-731.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, age of sitting, teething, and walking all occur at about the same time in men and women.  However, men enter [[w:puberty|puberty]] on average two years later than do women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant1995&quot;&gt;Plant TM, Lee PA, eds. The Neurobiology of Puberty. Bristol: Society for Endocrinology, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no significant differences in intelligence, happiness, or self-esteem between men and women.{{ref|Diener1999}}  However, women are, statistically, twice as vulnerable to anxiety disorders and depression, but only one-third as vulnerable to suicide and one-fifth as vulnerable to alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor2000&quot;&gt;Cantor CH. Suicide in the Western World. In: Hawton K, van Heering K, eds. International handbook of suicide and attempted suicide. Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000: 9-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Women attempt suicide more often than men but have lower rates of &quot;success&quot;, because their preferred methods do not involve firearms, unlike men. Women are also less likely to suffer hyperactivity or speech disorders as children or to display antisocial personalities as adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers1996&quot;/&gt;  Finally, women have slightly more olfactory receptors on average and are more easily re-aroused immediately after orgasm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers1996&quot;&gt;Myers, David G. 1996. Social Psychology (Fifth Edition). McGraw Hill. ISBN 0071145087&lt;/ref&gt;

Much evidence has shown that there are differences in male and female brains. In fact, the temporal lobe, which is the part of the brain associated with language and emotion, develops up to 4 years earlier in girls in comparison to boys&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg2008&quot;&gt;Steinberg, Laurence D. Adolescence. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the left parietal lobe, which is associated with mathematical and spatial reasoning, is thought to develop up to 4 years earlier in boys. This difference could account for the fact that girls are sometimes thought to be better when it comes to language and are more emotional, while boys are thought to be better in math. As well, some say that girls are better at hearing than boys. A typical teenaged girl hears up to 7 times better than a typical teenaged boy. This could possibly explain why boys are diagnosed with ADHD more often.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_237.pdf Diagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disability: United States, 2004–2006]&lt;/ref&gt;. Lastly there is a difference between sight for girls and boys. Girls are able to see facial expressions / emotions better while boys are able to see motion better. Girls use the p-cells in the retina, which are associated with texture and color, while boys use m-cells, which are associated with motion.

==Social and Psychological Differences==
As the previous section outlined, some gender differences are attributable to biology.  However, there are a number of gender differences that vary by society, environment, and/or culture, indicating they are social constructions. For example, in work group situations in the U.S., men tend to focus on the task at hand whereas women tend to focus more on personal relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabriel1999&quot;&gt;Gabriel, S. &amp; Gardner, W.L. (1999). Are there &quot;his&quot; and &quot;hers&quot; types of interdependence?  The implications of gender differences in collective versus relational interdependence for affect, behavior, and cognition.  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, 642-655.&lt;/ref&gt; When eating, women eating with men tend to eat fewer calories than when they are eating with women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2009&quot;&gt;Young, Meredith E., Madison Mizzau, Nga T. Mai, Abby Sirisegaram, Margo Wilson. 2009. What you eat depends on your sex and eating companions. Appetite. Available online 29 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these differences in behavior vary by culture and are therefore believed to be socially constructed.  Two detailed examples of socially constructed gender differences are presented below: workforce differences and education.

===Work and Occupations===
[[File:Labor force participation rates - 1960-2045.png|right|thumb|300px]]

An often discussed and debated difference between men and women involves work and occupations.  Women's participation in the workforce has varied significantly over time.  Prior to the development of capitalism and factory-type work, women played a significant role in food production and household maintenance.  With the advent of capitalism and labor outside of the home, women continued to play a significant role, though their participation in paid labor outside the home initially diminished.  Also, women's participation in the labor force varied (and varies) depending on marital status and social class.

[[File:Employed civilians by occupation and sex - 2007.png|thumb|right|300px]]

Current U.S. labor force statistics illustrate women's changing role in the labor force.  For instance, since 1971, women's participation in the labor force has grown from 32 million (43.4% of the female population 16 and over) to 68 million (59.2% of the female population 16 and over).[http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat2.pdf]  Women also make, on average, $17,000 less than do men.[http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf]   Women tend to be concentrated in less prestigious and lower paying occupations&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose1983&quot;&gt;Bose, Christine E. and Peter H. Rossi. (1983). Gender and Jobs: Prestige Standings of Occupations as Affected by Gender. American Sociological Review, Vol. 48, No. 3, pp. 316-330.&lt;/ref&gt; that are traditionally considered ''women's jobs'' (also referred to as ''pink collar'' jobs).[http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf]  Finally, women are not paid the same wages as men for similar work.  This difference is often illustrated as a ratio, as shown in the graph below.  Women tend to make between 75% and 91% of what men make for comparable work, though it depends on how the comparison is made.  For instance, college educated women between 26 and 45 earned 74.7 cents in hourly pay for every dollar men in the same group made in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; However, if you compare women and men with similar profiles and qualifications, the gap is smaller: women make about 91% of what men make, at least they have since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;&gt;Leonhardt, D. (2006). Gender Pay Gap, Once Narrowing, Is Stuck in Place. The New York Times. December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, similarly qualified women made only 82% as much as their male counterparts.

However, at all educational and skill levels, women still make less than men, as illustrated in the figure below.  That women earn less than men with equal qualifications helps explain why women are enrolling in college at higher rates than are men - they require a college education to make the same amount as men with a high school diploma.

[[File:Average earnings of workers by education and sex - 2006.png|center|600px|thumb]]

[[Image:1999_earnings_ratio.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ratio of Women's Earnings to Men's Earnings by Earnings Precentile: 1999]]

The gap between men's and women's wages narrowed during the 1980s and mid 1990s, but that momentum has fallen off and the distance now appears to have stagnated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; The gap in income between genders used to be similar between middle-class and affluent workers, but it is now widest among the most highly paid.  A woman making in the 95th percentile in 2006 would earn about $95,000 per year; a man in the 95th earning percentile would make about $115,000, a 28% difference (and that's not including the highest earners, who are predominantly men).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;  The narrowing of the gap in pay has also been called into question.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulligan2008&quot;&gt;Mulligan, Casey B., and Yona Rubinstein. 2008. “Selection, Investment, and Women's Relative Wages Over Time*.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 123:1061-1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it appears there has been a narrowing of the gap in pay between men and women, Mulligan and Rubinstein&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulligan2008&quot;/&gt; show that much of the narrowing is actually the result of the most able women entering the workforce and not decreases in the pay gap between men and women.  Thus, even the apparent narrowing of pay between the sexes likely overestimates the actual differences in pay.

It is quite difficult for women to climb to the top in the business world.  For instance, only 3% of tech firms and just 1% of high-tech firms were founded by women and very few are headed by women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadhwa2010&quot;&gt;Wadhwa, Vivek. February 7, 2010. Silicon Valley: You and Some of Your VC's Have a Gender Problem. TechCrunch.com. http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/07/silicon-valley-you%E2%80%99ve-got-a-gender-problem-and-some-of-your-vc%E2%80%99s-still-live-in-the-past/ (Accessed: February 7th, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the women who do climb to the top of the organizational ladder in business also experience both overt and covert discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haslam2009&quot;&gt;Haslam, S. Alexander, Michelle K. Ryan, Clara Kulich, Grzegorz Trojanowski, and Cate Atkins. 2009. “Investing with Prejudice: the Relationship Between Women's Presence on Company Boards and Objective and Subjective Measures of Company Performance.” British Journal of Management 9999. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2009.00670.x (Accessed August 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, companies with women on the board of directors have lower stock evaluations than do companies with exclusively male boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haslam2009&quot;/&gt;  This is likely a reflection of the lack of shareholder trust in women.  Women are also often put into leadership positions in corporations when companies are in a crisis and have little hope for recovery, resulting in poorer evaluations of women in leadership positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2005&quot;&gt;Ryan, Michelle K., and S. Alexander Haslam. 2005. “The Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women are Over-Represented in Precarious Leadership Positions.” British Journal of Management 16:81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon of putting women into leadership positions when companies are in trouble is referred to as &quot;the glass cliff&quot; and is also observed in politics, as women are disproportionately chosen to run in elections when it is almost guaranteed that the incumbent male candidate will win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2010&quot;&gt;Ryan, Michelle K., S. Alexander Haslam, and Clara Kulich. 2010. Politics and the Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women are Preferentially Selected to Contest Hard-to-Win Seats. Psychology of Women Quarterly. 34:56-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common explanation for the wage gap between men and women is the finding that women pay a motherhood wage penalty&lt;ref name=&quot;Budig2001&quot;&gt;Budig, M. and England, P. 2001. The Wage Penalty for Motherhood. American Sociological Review. 66:204-25.&lt;/ref&gt;, regardless of whether or not they are actually mothers.  You can think about this from the perspective of a potential employer: If you have two equally qualified candidates for a position, both are in their mid-twenties, married, and straight out of college, but one is a male and the other is female, which would you choose?  Many employers choose men over women because women are &quot;at risk&quot; of having a child, even though they may not want to have children.  And, of course, to the potential employer accommodating a pregnant woman and mother is more cumbersome than a male turned father (despite the obvious need for children to continue our species).  Thus, women pay a penalty for their ability to give birth.  Additionally, when women do have children, this often requires a period of time outside the workforce, whether it's six weeks or several months.  Employers take the time off into account when considering raises.  The &quot;Mommy track&quot; often results in women making less money than equally qualified men who have been in the same job for the same amount of time because women take time off to have children and are often responsible for taking care of children while men rarely do so.  Thus, women are often paid less despite having the same qualifications because they are (1) at risk of having children or (2) do have children and are penalized for doing so.

Another possible explanation for the wage gap between men and women has recently been proposed - customer bias towards white males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hekman2009&quot;&gt;Hekman, David R.; Aquino, Karl; Owens, Brad P.; Mitchell, Terence R.; Schilpzand, Pauline; Leavitt, Keith. 2009. An Examination of Whether and How Racial and Gender Biases Influence Customer Satisfaction. Academy of Management Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hekman et al. (2009) found that customers who viewed videos featuring a black male, a white female, or a white male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the white male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance, despite the fact that all three actors performed identical, read the same script, and were in the exact same location with identical camera angles and lighting.  They provide further evidence to support this claim by noting that white male doctors are rated as more approachable and competent than other doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that employers are willing to pay more for white male employees because employers are customer driven and customers are happier with white male employees.  They also suggest that what is required to solve the problem of wage inequality isn't necessarily paying women more but changing customer biases.  Additional reasons for disparity in pay are discussed below.

Another factor that may contribute to the higher wages of white men is the number of job leads they receive.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonald2009&quot;&gt;McDonald, Steve, Nan Lin, and Dan Ao. 2009. “Networks of Opportunity: Gender, Race, and Job Leads.” Social Problems 56:385.&lt;/ref&gt;  White men, particularly those in management positions, receive more job leads from friends and colleagues than do white women and Hispanic men and women.  Black men and women receive about as many job leads and tips, but only for non-management jobs.  As many jobs result from social networking, white males are advantaged by their higher number of job leads, potentially contributing to their higher salaries and more prestigious jobs.

===Education===
Another often studied difference between men and women is educational attainment.  For a long time, higher education (undergraduate and graduate education) was an exclusively male bastion.  Women did eventually gain access to institutions of higher learning, but parity or equality on a number of levels has still not been achieved.  One measure of educational attainment where women have made great inroads is in college attendance.  In 1960, 37.9% of female high school graduates enrolled in college, compared with 54.0% of male high school graduates.  In 2002, more female high school graduates were enrolling in college than males, 68.4% of females vs. 62.1% males.[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d03/tables/pdf/table186.pdf]  Women have, in fact, made significant progress in this respect.  Women now earn more Bachelors and Masters degrees than do men, and for the first time in 2009, they earned more PhDs.[http://www.cgsnet.org/portals/0/pdf/N_pr_ED2009.pdf] Women have made significant inroads into some of the traditionally most prestigious professions as well: 40% of medical school graduates are women and women make up large percentages of law school students as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

Despite the progress, there are still problems.  While women are entering college at higher rates and even earning more degrees, the degrees are in less prestigious areas (e.g., social sciences and humanities compared to physical sciences) and women with degrees still earn less than do men with comparable degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1996&quot;&gt;Jacobs, Jerry A. 1996. Gender Inequality and Higher Education. Annual Review of Sociology. 22:153-185.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in medicine, women tend to concentrate in lower paying specialties (e.g., dermatology and family medicine). The highest paid specialties are dominated by men and will be for decades to come, based on the pipeline of residents: 28% of radiology residents in 2004-5 were women, and only 10% of orthopedic surgery residents were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

At the primary and secondary levels, girls don't often do as well as boys, particularly in math and the sciences.  One recent study offers a partial explanation for why this might be the case: highly math-anxious female teachers in elementary school pass their math-anxiety on to the girls in the classroom, but not to the boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beilock2010&quot;&gt;Beilock, S. L., E. A. Gunderson, G. Ramirez, and S. C. Levine. 2010. “Female teachers' math anxiety affects girls' math achievement.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of the class, there were no differences in math anxiety between the boys and girls, but in classes taught by female math-anxious teachers, girls developed math anxiety and boys did not.  This anxiety led girls to believe boys were better at math than girls, though there is no evidence to suggest that is actually the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beilock2010&quot;/&gt;

==Sexism==
'''Sexism''' is [[w:discrimination|discrimination]] against people based on their sex or gender. Sexism can refer to three subtly different beliefs or attitudes:
*The belief that one sex is superior to the other.
*The belief that men and women are very different and that this should be strongly reflected in society, language, the right to have sex, and the law.
*It can also refer to simple hatred of men ([[w:misandry|misandry]]) or women ([[w:misogyny|misogyny]]).

Many peoples' beliefs on this topic range along a continuum. Some people believe that women should have equal access to all jobs. Others believe that while women are superior to men in a few aspects, in most aspects men are superior to women.

[[Image:Votingwomen.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Women voting in [[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]].]]

Sexist beliefs are an example of [[w:essentialism|essentialist]] thought, which holds that individuals can be understood (and often judged) based on the characteristics of the group to which they belong; in this case, their sex group (male or female). Essentialism assumes that all individuals clearly fit into the category of ''male'' or ''female'', which is not the case.  It also assumes characteristics are immutable, which is also not the case.

A good example of sexism against women is a question that has been asked in numerous surveys over the years in the US, &quot;Would you vote for a female candidate for president?&quot;  A 2005 Gallup poll found that 92% of Americans would vote for a female candidate, but follow-up research&lt;ref name=&quot;Streb2008&quot;&gt;Streb, Matthew J., Barbara Burrell, Brian Frederick, and Michael A. Genovese. 2008. “Social Desirability Effects and Support for a Female American President.” Public Opin Q 72:76-89.&lt;/ref&gt; found that this percentage was the result of [[w:response bias|response bias]].  When you use research techniques that allow people to express how they really feel toward women, the actual percentage who would not vote for a female candidate because she is female is closer to 26%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streb2008&quot;/&gt;  Intriguingly, it is not just men who feel that way, but some women, too.  In short, nearly 1/4 of Americans maintain sexist attitudes against women.

Sexism against women is often called ''[[w:chauvinism|chauvinism]]'', though chauvinism is actually a wider term for any extreme and unreasonable partisanship toward a group to which one belongs, especially when the partisanship includes malice and hatred towards a rival group. Many forms of [[w:radical feminism|radical feminism]] can legitimately be referred to as ''chauvinism''. This is not common usage, however, and the term is most often used to refer to [[w:male chauvinism|male chauvinism]]. 

While the view that women are superior to men is also sexism, only in recent years has an awareness of this ''[[w:reverse sexism|reverse sexism]]'' begun to develop in public discourse. Certain forms of sexual discrimination are illegal in many countries, but nearly all countries have laws that give special rights, privileges, or responsibilities to one sex.

Recent research illustrates the pervasiveness of sexism in the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messner2006&quot;&gt;Messner, M.A., Duncan, M.C., &amp; Willms, N. (2006). This Revolution Is Not Being Televised. Contexts: Understanding People in their Social Worlds, 5(3), 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Messner et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messner2006&quot;/&gt; found that sports coverage on major television networks focuses predominantly on men, despite the increase in female participation in sports since the passage of [[w:Title IX|Title IX]] in 1972. In 1971, 294,000 high school girls played interscholastic sports, compared to 3.7 million boys.  By 1989 that ratio changed substantially - 1.8 million girls played sports compared to 3.4 million boys. By 2004 the ratio had changed even more - 2.9 million girls compared to 4.0 million boys.  At the collegiate level, the change was also substantial. In 1972, the average college in the U.S. had two women's sports teams.  In just the four years between 2000 and 2004, universities in the U.S. added 631 new women's teams.

Despite the increase in participation in sports, major network news coverage of women's sports has changed very little over the last 15 years.  In 1989 women garnered only 5% of air time; in 1999 that increased to 9%, but it fell back to 6% by 2005.  Sports highlights shows (e.g., ESPNS's [[w:sportscenter|SportsCenter]]) are even less accommodating, giving only 2% to 3% of air time to women.  What's more, the little amount of air time given to women often portrays women's sports as &quot;novelties&quot; or pseudo-sports and often includes gags, like the women's nude [[w:bungee|bungee]] jump in 1999. Additionally, much of the coverage of women in sports is sexualized, as attention is often only given to women deemed &quot;attractive&quot; by the news anchors (e.g., [[w:Anna Kournikova|Anna Kournikova]] and [[w:Maria Sharapova|Maria Sharapova]]). Whether this treatment of women in sport is intentional or not, it is a clear example of sexism in the media.

[[Image:Oprah Winfrey (2004).jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[w:Oprah Winfrey|Oprah Winfrey]] is one of the wealthiest women in the world, an exception to the findings of Tickamyer.]]

Another example of gender discrimination is the disparity in wealth between men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tickamyer1981&quot;&gt;Tickamyer, Ann R. 1981. Wealth and Power: A Comparison of Men and Women in the Property Elite. Social Forces. 60(2):463-481.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using biographical data published in magazines and books as well as IRS income reports, Tickamyer found:
*there are fewer wealthy women than there are wealthy men
*it is not entirely clear as to whether sources of wealth differ, but it does appear that women are more likely than men to inherit their wealth (especially from husbands)
*the forms of women's holdings differ from men's; many women have their money in trusts, which is a safer form of investment than those used by men (e.g., stocks and bonds)
*women are less likely to have control over their wealth than men and are less likely to be actively engaged in increasing their wealth through investments as, say, the head of a company is engaged in growing his wealth

The author attributed the differences in wealth distribution to historical instances of gender discrimination.  Up until the 19th Century most women could not own property and women's participation in the paid labor force outside the home was limited. It is possible that wealth among the elite may be redistributed toward a more equal balance between the sexes with increasing numbers of women entering the workforce and moving toward more financially lucrative positions in major corporations.

The differences in income between men and women mentioned above are partially due to discrimination, but also due, in part, to some women (including highly educated women) choosing to leave the labor force and stay home with their young children.  Leaving the labor force doubly impacts income: (1) It takes away immediate income, and (2) reduces experience and tenure, lowering future earning potential. Additionally, while women have made significant inroads into many highly paid fields (e.g., medicine, law), the influx of women into those fields has slowed since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

Women in some organizations are suing their employers claiming gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; For instance, [[w:Wal-Mart |Wal-Mart]] is currently facing a lawsuit by some of its female employees who allege gender discrimination.  Part of the plaintiffs' argument rests on the fact that, while roughly 75% of intra-store department heads are women, only 20% of store managers (who make close to $100,000 per year) are women. It is difficult to prove discrimination in such cases.  In fact, many researchers point out that there may and probably are other root causes, including: differences in gender socialization (men believe they need to support their families as the primary breadwinners, leading to greater job commitment) and emphasis by the government on equality in pay and opportunity between genders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

===Violence===
Sexism can take many forms, including preventing women from attending college and paying women less than men for comparable work.  Another common form of sexism is violence, especially violence toward women. In 2002, women were the victims of over 900,000 violent crimes and over 200,000 rapes or sexual assaults.[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus02.pdf]   Men are more likely to be the victims of violent crime, but far less likely to be the victims of rapes or sexual assaults.

==Theories of Gender Differences==
===Gender Socialization===
Sociologists and other social scientists generally attribute many of the behavioral differences between genders to socialization.  [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|As discussed in the chapter on socialization]], socialization is the process of transferring norms, values, beliefs, and behaviors to future group members.  In gender socialization, the groups people join are the gender categories, ''males'' and ''females''.  Thus, gender socialization is the process of educating and instructing potential males and females as to the norms, behaviors, values, and beliefs of group membership.

Preparations for gender socialization begin even before the birth of the child.  One of the first questions people ask of expectant parents is the ''sex'' of the child.  This is the beginning of a social categorization process that continues throughout life.  Preparations for the birth often take the infant's sex into consideration (e.g., painting the room blue if the child is a boy, pink for a girl).  Many of the gender differences just described are attributed to differences in socialization, though it is possible genetic and biological factors play some role.  It is important to keep in mind that gender differences are a combination of social and biological forces; sometimes one or the other has a larger influence, but both play a role in dictating behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobash1979&quot;&gt;Dobash, R. Emerson, and Russell Dobash. 1979. Violence Against Wives. Macmillan USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  

One illustration of early life gender socialization can be seen in preschool classrooms.  Children in preschool classrooms where teachers were told to emphasize gender differences saw an increase in stereotyped views of what activities are appropriate for boys and girls, while children with teachers who did not emphasize gender showed no increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilliard2010&quot;&gt;Hilliard, Lacey J., and Lynn S. Liben. 2010. “Differing Levels of Gender Salience in Preschool Classrooms: Effects on Children’s Gender Attitudes and Intergroup Bias.” Child Development 81:1787-1798.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study supports the idea that subtle cues that surround us in our everyday lives strongly influence gender socialization.

Research&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg1983&quot;&gt;Greenberg, Ellen and Steinberg, Laurence D. 1983. Sex Differences in Early Labor Force Experience: Harbinger of Things to Come. Social Forces. 62(2):467-486.&lt;/ref&gt; finds that gender differences in work and occupations begin with adolescents' first jobs:
*first jobs are significantly segregated by sex
*girls work fewer hours per week than boys
*girls earn less per hour than boys
*hourly wages are higher in job types dominated by males
*girls are assigned more housework than are boys&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerson2001&quot;&gt;Gerson, Kathleen. “Children of the Gender Revolution: Some Theoretical Questions and Findings from the Field.” Pp. 446-461 in Restructuring Work and the Life Course, edited by Victor W. Marshall, Walter R. Heinz, Helga Krueger, and Anil Verma. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers attribute these differences to gender socialization and differential opportunities for boys and girls.

Another example of research finding differences in behavior between genders can be seen in the differences in self-ratings of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rand1983&quot;&gt;Rand, Cynthia S. and Hall, Judith A. 1983. Sex Differences in the Accuracy of Self-Perceived Attractiveness. Social Psychology Quarterly. 46(4):359-363.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using fifty-five Johns Hopkins University undergraduates (24 females), the authors had the students fill out questionnaires they designed as self-appraisals of attractiveness. The authors then used a panel to rate the attractiveness of the participants (an objective measure).  The researchers found that women are fairly accurate in their assessments of their attractiveness but men are not.  They explained their findings by discussing the salience of attractiveness for women, a characteristic learned through socialization: Attractiveness is a more important component of women's lives then men's.  This is seen in the disparity between men and women in the number of cosmetic surgeries they undergo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2007&quot;&gt;Carr, Deborah. 2007. “Body Work.” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:58.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 11.5 million cosmetic surgeries performed in 2005, women accounted for 85% to 90% of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2007&quot;/&gt; Because attractiveness is so important for women, they are more attuned to their actual attractiveness than are men.

===Sociobiology===
[[w:sociobiology|Sociobiologists]] and [[w:evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] argue that much of social life as we know it today has roots in human evolution and biology.  According to these theories, some of the gender differences in behavior are attributable to differences in physiology.  For instance, differences in sexuality and sex drives may be due to human evolution.  Women, who physically invest more in the creation and bearing of children (through pregnancy), may have a greater propensity toward [[w:monogamy|monogamous]] relationships as having a partner to help them improves the chances of their child's survival.  Men, on the other hand, may be inclined less toward monogamy and more toward polygamous relationships as their investment in offspring can be (and often is) far smaller than that of women.  Evolutionary psychologists and sociobiologists use this theory to explain differences in sexual behavior, attitudes, and attractions between men and women: women tend to be attracted to men who can provide support (i.e., protection and resources) and prefer fewer sexual partners than do men; men, on the other hand, are attracted to fertile women (the symbols of which have changed over time) and prefer more sexual partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buss1994&quot;&gt;Buss, David M. 1994. The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating. New York: Basic Books. ISBN 046500802X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural Functionalism===
In this perspective, which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parsons1964&quot;&gt;Parsons, Talcott. 1964. Social System. Free Press. ISBN 0029241901&lt;/ref&gt; genders are viewed as complementary - women take care of the home while men provide for the family.  Much current research, especially after the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, criticizes this approach for supporting the status quo and condoning the oppression of women

===Conflict Theory===
In contrast to the status quo supporting structural functionalist approach, social conflict theory argues that gender is best understood in terms of power relationships.  Men's dominance of women is seen as an attempt to maintain power and privilege to the detriment of women.  This approach is normative in that it prescribes changes to the power structure, advocating a balance of power between genders. (See also [[w:feminist theory|feminist theory]].)

==Research Example==
A powerful example of how gender affects every day life comes from the recently published research of Kristen Schilt on female-to-male (FTM) transexuals in the workplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schilt2006&quot;&gt;Schilt, Kristen. &quot;Just One of the Guys?: How Transmen Make Gender Visible in the Workplace.&quot; Gender &amp; Society. 20 (4) 2006, 465-490.&lt;/ref&gt; Schilt interviewed FTM transsexuals after they had undergone their sexual identity changes and found that, following their change to a male identity, two-thirds of the FTM transsexuals saw increased benefits in the workplace, including receiving greater rewards for doing less work.  They were also treated differently.  They found that their opinions had greater authority and received more recognition for their work. The FTMs who did not experience these benefits tended to be smaller and minorities. In short, white males are privileged in the workplace, even when those &quot;white males&quot; were formerly white females.  The lesson: Perceived gender has a powerful influence on every day social interaction.

==Notes==
&quot;Gender&quot; is derived from the [[w:French language|Old French]] word ''genre'', meaning &quot;kind of thing&quot;.  It goes back to the [[w:Latin|Latin]] word ''genus'' (meaning &quot;kind&quot;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Family67.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A large family from the U.S., circa 1984.]]

Most people have a network of others they consider their family.  But what exactly is a family?  How do family structures vary from culture to culture or subculture to subculture?  Is what we consider the traditional family changing over time?  Why do families exist?  These are the questions sociologists ask when discussing families.

==What is a family?==
You may think this is a fairly straightforward question with a simple answer.  But think about it for a minute then ask yourself, &quot;Who and what do I include in my family?&quot; You might say your parents, your siblings, and/or your spouse.  But what about the family pet?  What if you were raised by your grandparents and your parents played little to no role in your life?  Who, then, do you consider your family?  Is family limited to genetically related individuals; those we typically think of as kin?

Questioning the basic concept of family is a relatively new phenomenon, though variations in what we consider a &quot;family&quot; are not.  There are so many variations of &quot;family&quot; today that it is hard to define what, exactly, a family is.  Generally, we think of a '''family''' as a domestic [[w:group (sociology)|group]] of people, or a number of domestic groups linked through descent from: (1) a common ancestor, (2) marriage, or (3) adoption. Families generally have some degree of kinship. 

But society increasingly accepts a number of variations on traditional family forms. Consider each of the following examples:
*an elderly man and his twelve cats
*a cohabiting homosexual couple with three foster children
*a mixed group of singles sharing a town home in a large city
*a close knit fraternity or sorority
*a small group of soldiers fighting in a foreign country

Each of the above groups differs from the traditional form of family: a man, a woman, and their children.  This traditional notion of parents and children as family is called a ''[[w:nuclear family|nuclear family]]'' and is an invention of the Western World.  It is a social construct that does not necessarily reflect the reality of family life for many people.  In fact, with recent developments in the U.S., the nuclear family is no longer the primary form of social life in the U.S. According to recent census data, more adult women now live alone or are raising their children alone than are living with a spouse or raising their children with a spouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2006&quot;/&gt; What many people consider a family is not the only family form; families are diverse in both form and function.

===Cultural Variations===
[[Image:Polygamy world map.png|thumb|300px|right|A map of the world regions where polygamy is a common form of family structure.]]

The structure of families traditionally hinges on relations between parents and children, between spouses, or both. Consequently, there is substantial variation in family forms around the world, varying from culture to culture. The most common form of family structure in the Western World is monogamy, which is the practice of having only one spouse at a time. A variety of other family structures exist.  One prevalent form is polygamy, which broadly refers to any form of marriage in which a person has more than one spouse. Historically, polygamy has been practiced as polygyny (one man having more than one wife), as polyandry (one woman having more than one husband), or, less commonly, as &quot;polygamy&quot; (having many wives and many husbands at one time). 

Another factor that leads to cultural variations in family forms is attitudes toward endogamy. Endogamy is the practice of marrying within a social group. Cultures that practice endogamy require marriage between specified social groups, classes, or ethnicities. Many people tend to marry members of their own social group, but there are some societies that practice endogamy very strictly and as part of their moral values, traditions, or religious beliefs. An example of a strictly endogamous religious group is the Yazidi in Northern Iraq, who prohibit any inter-clan marrying. Endogamy is a common practice among displaced cultures attempting to make roots in new countries as it encourages group solidarity and ensures greater control over group resources (which may be important to preserve where a group is attempting to establish itself within an alien culture).

===Changes Over Time===
[[File:Types of us households 2002.png|thumb|right|300px|This figure illustrates the changing structure of families in the U.S. Only 7% of families in the U.S. in 2002 were &quot;traditional&quot; families in the sense that the husband worked and earned a sufficient income for the wife and kids to stay home.  Many families are now dual-earner families.  The &quot;other&quot; group includes the many households that are headed by a single parent.]]

Family structures of some kind are found in every society. Pairing off into formal or informal marital relationships originated in hunter-gatherer groups to forge networks of cooperation beyond the immediate family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2006. Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage. Penguin. ISBN: 014303667X&lt;/ref&gt;  Intermarriage between groups, tribes, or clans was often political or strategic and resulted in reciprocal obligations between the two groups represented by the marital partners.  Even so, marital dissolution was not a serious problem as the obligations resting on marital longevity were not particularly high.

The development of horticultural or agriculture-based societies fundamentally changed the nature of marriage.  With the advent of sedentary societies, marriage became one of the central institutions for forging economic and political relationships and was no longer viewed, at least among the aristocracy, as a relationship that should be based on love, companionship, or sexual attraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;/&gt; Among the aristocratic elite, marriage became a means of developing alliances or amassing wealth.  For the non-elites, marriage was a pragmatic way of supporting oneself: it was easier to survive if resources (i.e., food, labor power, childcare responsibilities, etc.) were pooled between several people.

You can see a good example of the changing nature of families in the family structure of Ancient Rome. In Ancient Rome the family structure was centered on the father (see ''[[w:paterfamilias|paterfamilias]]''). In this structure, fathers held great power (''patria potestas'') over those living with them: They could force marriage and divorce, sell children into slavery, claim dependents' property as their own, and possibly even claim the right to kill family members. ''Patria potestas'' extended over adult sons with their own households: A man was not considered a ''paterfamilias'' while his own father lived. A daughter, when she married, usually fell under the authority of the ''paterfamilias'' of her husband's household, although this was not always the case, as she could choose to continue recognizing her father's family as her true family. However, as Romans reckoned descent through the male line, any children she had would belong to her husband's family. Groups of related households formed a family. Families were based on blood ties (or adoption), but were also used for political and economic alliances. Ancient Roman marriage was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association, especially in the upper classes. 

Modern forms of family structure and marriage in the West have their roots in Christian philosophy and practice.  The [[w:nuclear family|nuclear family]] emerged during the late medieval period&lt;ref name=&quot;Greif2005&quot;&gt;Greif, Avner. 2005. Family Structure, Institutions, and Growth: The Origin and Implications of Western Corporatis http://www.aeaweb.org/annual_mtg_papers/2006/0106_0800_1104.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized during the Council of Trent, in which marriage was defined as, 
&quot;The conjugal union of man and woman, contracted between two qualified persons, which obliges them to live together throughout life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte1997&quot;/&gt;  While a variety of family structures continue to exist around the world today, including polygamous and polygynous families in many societies (including the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olaiz2006&quot;&gt;Olaiz, H. (2006). Warren Jeffs and the Mormon Art of Forgetting. Sunstone(142), 68-70.&lt;/ref&gt;, the predominant form is monogamy (though, as noted above, this is no longer the majority form). As described below, variations on monogamous relationships are increasingly prevalent (i.e., same-sex marriage), as are alternatives to monogamy (e.g., single-parent households).

==Families and Theory==
===The Function of Families===
The primary function of the family is to reproduce society, both biologically, through procreation, and socially, through socialization. Given these functions, one's experience of one's family shifts over time. From the perspective of children, the family is a '''family of orientation''': the family functions to locate children socially, and plays a major role in their socialization. From the point of view of the parent(s), the family is a '''family of procreation''': the family functions to produce and socialize children. In some cultures marriage imposes upon women the ''obligation'' to bear children. In northern Ghana, for example, payment of [[w:bridewealth|bridewealth]] signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face substantial threats of physical abuse and reprisals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bawah1999 &quot;&gt;Bawah, A.A.; Akweongo, P.; Simmons, R.; and Phillips, J.F. 1999. Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties: The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana.  Studies in Family Planning. 30:1, 54-66. http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Producing offspring is not the only function of the family. Marriage sometimes establishes the legal father of a woman's child; establishes the legal mother of a man's child; gives the husband or his family control over the wife's sexual services, labor, and/or property; gives the wife or her family control over the husband's sexual services, labor, and/or property; establishes a joint fund of property for the benefit of children; establishes a relationship between the families of the husband and wife. No society does all of these; no one of these is universal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohannan1968&quot;&gt;Bohannan, Paul and Middleton, Jon. 1968. Marriage, Family, and Residence. Natural History Press. ASIN: B006D7FBI&lt;/ref&gt; In societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between a husband and wife, is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household. In modern societies marriage entails particular rights and privilege that encourage the formation of new families even when there is no intention of having children.

===The Sociobiology of Families===
In almost all societies, marriage between brothers and sisters is forbidden, with Ancient Egyptian, Hawaiian, and Inca royalty being the rare exceptions. In many societies, marriage between some first cousins is preferred, while at the other extreme, the medieval Catholic church prohibited marriage even between distant cousins. The present day Catholic Church still maintains a standard of required distance (in both consanguinity and affinity) for marriage.

These sorts of restrictions are a form of [[w:exogamy|exogamy]]. One exception to this pattern is in ancient Egypt, where marriage [[w:incest|between brothers and sisters]] was permitted in the royal family — as it was also permitted in Hawaii and among the Inca. This privilege was denied commoners and may have served to concentrate wealth and power in one family. The consequence of the incest-taboo is exogamy, the requirement to marry someone from another group. The incest taboo may serve to promote social solidarity.

==The Family Life Cycle==
===Courtship===
[[Image:Youth and suitors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Youth conversing with suitors''&lt;br&gt;from the ''Haft Awrang'' of [[Jami]], in the story ''A Father Advises his Son About Love.'']]

'''Courtship''' is the traditional dating period before engagement and marriage.  It is an alternative to [[w:arranged marriage|arranged marriage]]s in which the couple doesn't meet before the wedding. During a courtship, a couple gets to know each other and decides if there will be an engagement. Courting includes activities such as dating where couples go together for some activity (e.g., a meal or movie). Courting can also take place without personal contact, especially with modern technology.  [[w:Virtual dating|Virtual dating]], chatting on-line, sending text messages, conversing over the telephone, instant messaging, writing [[w:Letter (message)|letters]], and sending gifts are all modern forms of courting.

Courtship varies both by time period and by region of the world.  One way courtship varies is in the duration; courting can take days or years. In the United Kingdom, a poll of 3,000&lt;ref name=mc&gt; [http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/181134/average-man-proposes-after-three-years.html marieclaire.co.uk &gt; News &gt; World News &gt; Average man proposes after three years] Monday 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; engaged or married couples suggested in an average duration between first meeting and engagement of 2 years and 11 months,&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt; [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=99603&amp;in_page_id=8 Average man takes 3 years to propose] Metrosexual, Sunday, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:44-aspetti di vita quotidiana, stagione calda,Taccuino Sanit.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Courting, [[Tacuinum Sanitatis]] (XIV century)]]

While the date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very specific formal rules. In some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners, and then allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited. In Japan, some parents hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and résumés of potential mates, and if the couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance; this is called [[w:Miai|Omiai]]. In more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the practice of arranged marriages, where partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents.  Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which in such cultures may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.  Another variation of courtship is the [[w:Bundling (tradition)|bundling tradition]], which likely originated in Scandinavia and was carried to the U.S. by immigrants.  Bundling involved potential mates spending the night together in the same bed, though the couple was not supposed to engage in sexual relations.  This practice ceased in the late 19th Century.
 
In earlier centuries, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons. However, by the 1920s, dating for fun was becoming an expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was usually more chaste than is seen today, since pre-marital sex was not considered the norm even though it was widespread. As a result of social changes spurred by the [[w:sexual revolution|sexual revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the taboo of sex during dating began to wane. Couples today are more likely to &quot;hook up&quot; or &quot;hang out&quot; with large groups rather than go on old-fashioned, paired dates. In recent years, a number of college newspapers have featured editorials where students decry the lack of &quot;dating&quot; on their campuses. This may be a result of a highly-publicized 2001 study and campaign sponsored by the conservative American women's group [[w:Independent Women's Forum|Independent Women's Forum]], which promotes &quot;traditional&quot; dating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwf.org/campuscorner/hookingup.asp Hooking Up, Hanging Out, and Hoping for Mr. Right: College Women on Dating and Mating Today] (Retrieved 18:35, [[12 January]] [[2007]])&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in recent years traditional dating has evolved and taken on the metamorphic properties necessary to sustain itself in today's world.  This can be seen in the rise in internet dating, speed dating or gradual exclusivity dating (a.k.a. slow dating). Some theorize that courtship as it was known to prior generations has seen its last days and the next closest thing is gradual exclusivity, where the partners respect and value each other's individual lives but still maintain the ultimate goal of being together even if time or space does not permit it now.

Courtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity.  Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms.  Both Moore and Perper found that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women&lt;ref name=&quot;Perper1985&quot;&gt;Perper, T. (1985) ''Sex Signals: The Biology Of Love'', Philadelphia, ISI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, N. (1985) “Nonverbal courtship patterns in women: contact and consequences”, ''Ethology and Sociobiology'', 6: 237-247.&lt;/ref&gt;, driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond. This is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of body language&lt;ref name=&quot;Pease2004&quot;&gt;Pease, A. and Pease, B. (2004) ''The Definitive Book Of Body Language'', London: Orion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Feminist scholars, however, continue to regard courtship as a socially constructed (and male-led) process organised to subjugate women&lt;ref name=&quot;Hearn1987&quot;&gt;Hearn, J. &amp; Parkin, W. (1987) ''Sex at work: The power and paradox of organisation sexuality'', Brighton: Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R. W (1995) ''Gender and Power'', Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The main weakness in this argument, however, lies in the continuing empirical evidence that the institutions of courtship are more strongly supported by women than men.  Farrell reports, for example, that magazines about marriage and romantic fiction continue to attract a 98% female readership&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrell2000&quot;&gt;Farrell, W. (2000) ''Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say'', New York: Tarcher/Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Marriage===
'''Marriage''' is a governmentally, socially, or religiously recognized interpersonal relationship, usually intimate and sexual, that is often created as a form of contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Elmer&quot; Social Science Dictionary http://www.elissetche.org/dico/M.htm &quot;&gt;&quot;Elmer&quot; Social Science Dictionary http://www.elissetche.org/dico/M.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently occurring form of marriage is between a woman and a man, where the feminine term ''wife'' and the masculine ''husband'' are generally used to describe the parties to the contract. Other forms of marriage also exist. For example, polygamy, in which a person takes more than one spouse, is present in many societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murdoch1949&quot;&gt;Murdoch, George Peter. 1949. Social Structure. The MacMillan Company: New York. ISBN  0-02-922290-7.&lt;/ref&gt; (See, for instance, the [[w:Kaingang|Kaingang]], of Brazil, where close to 40% of the marriages were not monogamous but included multiple spousal partners.) Currently, the legal concept of marriage is expanding to include [[w:same-sex marriage|same-sex marriage]] in some areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arce2004&quot;&gt;Arce, Rose.

[[Image:Bride and groom signing the book.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A bride and groom at their wedding.]]

The [[w:ceremony|ceremony]] in which a marriage is enacted and announced to the community is called a wedding. The ways in which marriages are enacted have changed over time. In Europe during the [[w:Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], marriage was enacted by the couple promising verbally that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or other witnesses was not required. This promise was known as the &quot;verbum&quot;. If made in the present tense (e.g. &quot;I marry you&quot;), it was unquestionably binding; if made in the future tense (&quot;I will marry you&quot;), it would, by itself constitute a [[w:betrothal|betrothal]]. If the couple proceeded to have sexual relations, the union was a marriage. As part of the [[w:Reformation|Reformation]], the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state; by the 1600s many of the [[w:Protestantism|Protestant]] European countries had heavy state involvement in marriage. As part of the [[w:Counter-Reformation|Counter-Reformation]], the [[w:Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] added a [[w:Clandestinity (in Canon Law)|requirement]] of witnesses to the promise, which under normal circumstances had to include the priest.

[[File:Marriage and Divorce Rates in the US 1990-2007.png|right|thumb|300px]]

The reasons people marry vary widely, but usually include: to publicly and formally declare their [[w:love|love]], the formation of a single household unit, legitimizing sexual relations and [[w:procreation|procreation]], social and economic stability, and the education and nurturing of children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krier2006&quot;&gt;Krier, James E., Alexander, Gregory S., Schill, Michael H., and Dukeminier, Jesse. 2006. Property. Aspen Publishers. ISBN 0735557926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher2002&quot;&gt;Gallagher, Maggie. 2002. What is Marriage For? The Public Purposes of Marriage Law. Louisiana Law Review. http://www.marriagedebate.com/pdf/What%20is%20Marriage%20For.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A marriage can be declared by a wedding ceremony, which may be performed either by a religious officiator or through a similar government-sanctioned secular process. The act of marriage creates obligations between the individuals involved, and, in some societies, between the parties' extended families. Marriages are perpetual agreements with legal consequences, terminated only by the death of one party or by formal dissolution processes, such as divorce and annulment.

Schwartz and Mare&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2005&quot;&gt;Schwartz, Christine R. and Mare, Robert D. 2005. Trends in Educational Assortative Marriage From 1940 to 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; examined trends in marriage over time and found that the old maxim, &quot;opposites attract&quot; is less accurate of marriage than the maxim &quot;birds of a feather flock together.&quot;  Their research focused on one specific similarity in marital partners: education.  They found that the educational levels of American married couples decreased in similarity slightly after World War II but has since increased substantially.  As of 2003, one's level of educational attainment was a significant predictor of the educational attainment of one's spouse. People without a high school diploma are unlikely to marry someone with more educational attainment, and people with a college degree are likely to marry people with a similar level of educational attainment. Part of the reason why education is so influential in determining the level of education of one's spouse is because people tend to form groups based on levels of education.  First there are the groups formed in the process of becoming educated (many people meet their spouses in school). But jobs after one completes his/her education also tend to be grouped by level of education. As a result, people spend more time with individuals of a similar level of educational attainment.  As most people tend to marry or partner with individuals with whom they spend a lot of time, it is not surprising that there is significant educational similarity between spouses.

One well-known attribute of marriage is that it tends to have health benefits.  Happily married people tend to be healthier than unmarried people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt-Lunstad2008&quot;&gt;Holt-Lunstad, Julianne, Birmingham, Wendy, and Jones, Brandon Q. 2008. Is There Something Unique about Marriage? The Relative Impact of Marital Status, Relationship Quality, and Network Social Support on Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Mental Health. Annals of Behavioral Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallacher2011&quot;&gt;Gallacher, David and John Gallacher. 2011. Are Relationships Good For Your Health? Choose Your Partner Carefully. Student BMJ.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, unhappily married couples may not receive the same health benefits and may actually be less healthy than their single peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt-Lunstad2008&quot;/&gt;

===Children===
Kids raised in families with only one parent or with step-parents are more likely to have behavior problems than are kids raised with both parents.  Previous research has attributed this to the fact that single-parent households tend to be poorer than dual-parent households and poverty is related to behavior problems.  A recent study by Marcia Carlson&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson2006&quot;&gt;Carlson, Marcia J. 2006. Family Structure, Father Involvement, and Adolescent Behavioral Outcomes. Journal of Marriage and the Family. 68:1, 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt; adds a clue as to why children raised in single-parent households or households with step-parents might have more behavior problems. According to Carlson's study of nearly 3,000 teens, children whose fathers are more involved in their lives are less likely to have behavior problems. When the relationship between a child and the father is missing, children in single-parent and step-parent families are more likely to act out in negative ways. One way to reduce behavior problems in teenagers is to encourage a close relationship between them and their fathers.  There is also some evidence that the gender of children increases father involvement in the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raley2006&quot;&gt;Raley, Sara, and Suzanne Bianchi. 2006. “Sons, Daughters, and Family Processes: Does Gender of Children Matter?.” Annual Review of Sociology 32:401-421.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while having an active father helps improve behavior problems, fathers having sons helps improve their dedication and devotion to their families.

Another recent finding related to children is that parents have less influence on their childs' mate selections now than they used to.  Rosenfeld and Kim&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld2005&quot;&gt;Rosenfeld, Michael J. and Kim, Byung-Soo. 2005. The Independence of Young Adults and the Rise of Interracial and Same-Sex Unions. American Sociological Review. 70:4, 541-562.&lt;/ref&gt; found that a new life stage has developed in the latter half of the 20th century that they call the &quot;independent life stage.&quot;  This life stage is a period of time in which young adults leave home and live alone (often to go to college). Children used to remain in their parents home until they left to start their own family, but the independent life stage is a period of single-living prior to the formation of one's own family. As a result of this life stage, which also overlaps with the time in most children's' lives when they are beginning to look for life partners, parents are decreasingly involved in the decision-making process. Rosenfeld and Kim attribute the increase in interracial and same-sex marriages to the increasing prevalence of this life stage.

How parents raise children and childhood autonomy have also changed over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rutherford2009&quot;&gt;Rutherford, Markella. n.d. “Children’s Autonomy and Responsibility: An Analysis of Childrearing Advice.” Qualitative Sociology. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11133-009-9136-2 (Accessed August 6, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing back issues of Parents magazine, Markella Rutherford found that parents face a difficult task of trying to balance authority with childhood autonomy.  Children have gained more autonomy in private spaces in their homes (e.g., they are allowed to decorate their own rooms) but have lost autonomy in public areas outside the home (e.g., they are not allowed to go to the park alone).  Some of the loss of autonomy is the result of a growing fear among parents of child predators, which is generally over-stated.  This same factor may help explain the increase in autonomy in the home, as parents are trying to compensate for heightened supervision outside the home by allowing children greater freedom inside the home.  It is also now known that most parents regularly lie to their children, though this is typically done in the interest of getting kids to behave in positive ways.  Known as &quot;parenting by lying,&quot; the practice appears to be widespread and ironic, considering most parents also tell their kids not to lie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyman2009&quot;&gt;Heyman, Gail D., Diem H. Luu, and Kang Lee. 2009. “Parenting by Lying.” Journal of Moral Education 38(3):353–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kids are closely connected to a family's socioeconomic status as well.  Kids are expensive to raise, and the more kids a family has, on average, the lower the social class (though this is a complicated relationship as the causal direction goes both ways).  One illustration of this is the upward mobility of Catholics in the U.S. over the past few decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keister2007&quot;&gt;Keister, Lisa A. 2007. Upward Wealth Mobility: Exploring the Roman Catholic Advantage. Social Forces. 85(3):1195-1225&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholics in the U.S. used to be among the lower-middle sector of the population in terms of income and wealth.  But as of the 1990s and 2000s, Catholics in the U.S. rank higher, just above the middle.  Part of the reason for this has been a decrease in the size of Catholic families; Catholics are having about the same number of children as are non-Catholics in the U.S.  With smaller families, Catholics are able to retain more of their income and turn it into savings, improving their socioeconomic status.  Thus, the reduction in the number of kids among Catholics has actually improved their socioeconomic status on average.

===Divorce===
[[Image:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|thumb|200px|right|In some cultures, when a spouse dies, it is customary for the widow or widower to indicate their loss by dressing in specific ways and following certain behavioral guidelines.  This is a painting of [[w:Catherine de Medicis|Catherine de Medicis]] wearing the clothing of a widow from the 16th Century.]]

Numerous studies have tried to determine why 50 per-cent of marriages end in divorce within the first 25 years in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. The Way We Never
Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrie Yodanis&lt;ref name=&quot;Yodanis2005&quot;&gt;Yodanis, Carrie. 2005. “Divorce Culture and Marital Gender Equality: A Cross-National Study.” Gender Society 19:644-659.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a different approach, analyzing marriages that remain intact. Her cross-national study of 22 countries suggests that where there is more tolerance of divorce, there is greater gender equality within marriage. Most researchers think that women are disadvantaged by the ease of divorce. Where divorce is an option, women may feel more insecure and are therefore reluctant to push for change within a marriage. Contradicting these claims, Yodanis shows that the ease of divorce increases women's equality within marriage. Divorce is a negotiating tool for women who seek change in their relationships. In countries with greater acceptance of divorce, there is a more equal division of household work. Men risk losing their wives if they refuse to shape up and help out around the house. Thus, while divorce has helped many women leave unhealthy marriages in which they are at risk of great physical and mental harm, the ability to get a divorce easily may also strengthen marriages.

Another factor that contributes to high divorce rates is the change in laws that made divorce easier in the 1970s in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt; The introduction of &quot;[[w:No-fault divorce|No-fault divorce]]&quot; laws removed the burden of proving that one's spouse had caused irreparable damage to the relationship (through adultery, battery, etc.).  Women's rights advocates pushed for this change as it facilitated women's ability to exit unhealthy marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt;  Other factors that may have also contributed to the rise in divorces is a cultural mystique that suggests marriage should be blissful and not have any problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt;  This is a common depiction of marriage in media, but is far from an accurate portrayal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt;  The unrealistic expectations many couples bring to marriage heightens the probability of divorce if things don't align with those expectations. 

The increasing participation of women in the workforce has provided women with greater financial security.  With financial security comes independence.  Thus, women's workforce participation also increases the odds of divorce, though this is similar to Yodanis's argument - it really just empowers women who are in bad marriages to feel like they can leave the marriage and not experience a dramatic decline in quality of life.

Finally, there is a social-psychological component to divorce as well.  People have a tendency to unfairly judge other peoples' behavior as being &quot;part of who they are&quot; or part of their identity.  However, they do not hold themselves to the same critical judgment; when they do something that is mean, it is situationally determined and doesn't reflect their identity.  This is known as the [[w:fundamental attribution error|fundamental attribution error]] and can lead to the dissolution of relationships.  This occurs when the parties in the relationship attribute the negative behaviors they dislike to fundamental characteristics of the person rather than to the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tavris2007&quot;&gt;Tavris, Carol, and Elliot Aronson. 2007. Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts. 1st ed. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence to suggest that specific types of couple therapy can help couples see where they are committing the fundamental attribution error and substantially reduce the odds of divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anker2009&quot;&gt;Anker, M. G., Duncan, B. L., &amp; Sparks, J. A. (2009). Using client feedback to improve couple therapy outcomes: A randomized clinical trial in a naturalistic setting. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 77(4), 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divorce and widowhood carry with them the burden of reduced health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waite2009&quot;&gt;Waite, Linda and Mary Elizabeth Hughes. 2009. Marital Biography and Health Midlife. Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;  Divorced people have 20% more chronic health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, cancer) than do married people.  They also have 23% more mobility limitations (e.g., climbing stairs or walking a block).  Divorcees experience declines in health because of two things that accompany divorce: reduced income&lt;ref name=&quot;Angier2009&quot;&gt;Angier, Natalie. 2009. “Skipping Spouse to Spouse Isn’t Just a Man’s Game.” The New York Times, September 1 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/science/01angi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss (Accessed February 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and stresses over the dissolution of the marriage (e.g., things like negotiating child care). These differences in health remain even after an individual remarries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waite2009&quot;/&gt;

===Death and Widowing===
In most societies, the death of one of the partners terminates the marriage, and in monogamous societies this allows the other partner to remarry.  A spouse who outlives the other is referred to as a [[w:widow|widow]] (female) or [[w:widower|widower]] (male).

==Families and Inequality==
===Social Class===
[[File:Probability of First Marriage Dissolution by race and income 1995.png|right|400px]]

Families and family stability are strongly influenced by social class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bramlett2002&quot;&gt;Bramlett MD and Mosher WD. Cohabitation, Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the United States. National Center for Health Statistics. Vital Health Stat 23(22). 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the figure to the right illustrates, the probability of a first marriage ending is substantially higher for couples that live in poorer communities.  It is also higher for blacks than for whites and Hispanics.  The higher rates of divorce for individuals in lower social classes is largely attributable the greater stresses these couples face, particularly financial stress.

===Gender===
While marriage does increase the socioeconomic status of women, men reap many benefits from this type of living arrangement. For instance, while many women manage a household's finances, men generally retain control of the money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgoyne2006&quot;&gt;Burgoyne, Carole B., Victoria Clarke, Janet Reibstein, and Anne Edmunds. “‘All my worldly goods I share with you’? Managing money at the transition to heterosexual marriage..” Sociological Review 54, no. 4 (November 2006): 619-637.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when heterosexual couples divorce, women are much less affluent and a large percentage of divorced, single women fall below poverty lines.  Men also obtain greater mental health benefits from marriage than do women and report greater marital satisfaction than do women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowers1991&quot;&gt;Fowers, Blaine J. “His and Her Marriage: A Multivariate Study of Gender and Marital Satisfaction..” Sex Roles 24, no. 3/4 (February 1991): 209-221.&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater marital satisfaction men report is likely the result of the benefits they receive from marriage - companionship and household labor - while not having to sacrifice occupational success or career advancement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horwitz1991&quot;&gt;Horwitz, Allan V., and Helene Raskin White. “Becoming Married, Depression, and Alcohol Problems Among Young Adults..” Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior 32, no. 3 (1991): 221-237.&lt;/ref&gt;  Married women, on the other hand, do often have to sacrifice occupational success or career advancement, leading to many highly skilled women leaving the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;stone2007&quot;&gt;stone, pamela. 2007. “the rhetoric and reality of “opting out”.” Contexts 6:14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these women leave because the work environment does not allow for a balance between work and family; the lack of flexible work options for highly skilled women results in many of them &quot;opting out&quot; of the workforce, which is not a problem for men.&lt;ref name=&quot;stone2007&quot;/&gt;  Married women also have higher rates of mental illness than do single, widowed, and divorced women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gove1972&quot;&gt;Gove, Walter R. “The Relationship Between Sex Roles, Marital Status, and Mental Illness..” Social Forces 51, no. 1 (1972): 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who marry at younger ages generally have lower educational attainment (though the causal direction here goes both ways), have more kids, and are also more dependent on their husbands financially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh1996&quot;&gt;Susheela Singh and Renee Samara, “Early Marriage Among Women in Developing Countries,” December 1996, http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2214896.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, the benefits of marriage tend to favor men over women.

===Race and Ethnicity===
Societies have also at times required marriage from within a certain group. Anthropologists refer to these restrictions as [[w:endogamy|endogamy]]. An example of such restrictions would be a requirement to marry someone from the same tribe. [[w:Racism|Racist]] laws adopted by some societies in the past, such as [[w:Nazism|Nazi]]-era [[w:Germany]], [[w:History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid-era]] [[w:South Africa|South Africa]] and most of the [[w:United States|United States]] in the first half of the 20th century, which prohibited [[w:miscegenation|marriage between persons of different races]], could also be considered examples of endogamy. In the U.S., these laws were largely repealed between 1940 and 1960. The U.S. Supreme Court declared all such laws unconstitutional in the case of [[w:Loving v. Virginia|Loving v. Virginia]] in 1967.

Cultures that practiced [[w:slavery|slavery]] might admit that slave marriages formed but grant them no legal status. This was the practice under the Roman empire, so that in the [[w:Saints Perpetua and Felicitas|Acts of Perpetua and Felicitas]], the freewoman Perpetua could be described as &quot;a married matron&quot; but Felicitas as the &quot;fellow-servant&quot; of Revocatus — even though the Christians regarded, religiously, such marriages as binding. Likewise, slave marriages in the United States were not binding, so that many [[w:Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] escaping slavery during the [[w:American Civil War|American Civil War]] sought official status for their marriages. Among the rights distinguishing [[w:serfdom|serfdom]] from slavery was the right to enter a legally recognizable marriage.

===Religion===
The participants in a marriage usually seek social recognition for their relationship, and many societies require official approval of a religious or civil body. In the Protestant tradition, Calvin and his colleagues reformulated marriage through enactment of The Marriage Ordinance of Geneva, imposing, &quot;The dual requirements of state registration and church consecration to constitute marriage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte1997&quot;&gt;Witte, John Jr. 1997. From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition. Westminster John Knox Press. (pp. 39-40). ISBN 0664255434&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, it was [[w:Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act|Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act]] that first required a formal ceremony of marriage, thereby curtailing the practice of [[w:Fleet Marriage|Fleet Marriage]]. 

In many jurisdictions, the civil marriage ceremony may take place during the religious marriage ceremony, although they are theoretically distinct. In most American states, the marriage may be officiated by a [[w:priest|priest]], [[w:Religious minister|minister]], [[w:rabbi|rabbi]]  or other religious authority, and in such a case the religious authority acts simultaneously as an agent of the state.  In some countries, such as [[w:France|France]], [[w:Spain|Spain]], [[w:Germany|Germany]], [[w:Turkey|Turkey]], [[w:Argentina|Argentina]], and [[w:Russia|Russia]], it is necessary to be married by the state before having a religious ceremony.  

Conversely, there people who have religious ceremonies that are not recognized by civil authorities.  Examples include [[w:widow|widow]]s who stand to lose a pension if they remarry and so undergo a marriage only in the eyes of God and the community; homosexual couples (where same-sex marriage is not legally recognized); some sects which recognize polygamy (see, [[w:Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalism]]), retired couples who would lose pension benefits if legally married, Muslim men who wish to engage in polygamy that is condoned in some situations under [[w:Islam|Islam]], and immigrants who do not wish to alert the immigration authorities that they are married either to a spouse they are leaving behind or because the complexity of immigration laws may make it difficult for spouses to visit on a tourist visa.

In [[w:Europe|Europe]], it has traditionally been the churches' office to make marriages official by registering them. It was a significant step towards a clear [[w:separation of church and state|separation of church and state]] and advance toward a secular society when German Chancellor [[w:Otto von Bismarck|Otto von Bismarck]] introduced the ''Zivilehe'' (civil marriage) in 1875. This law made the declaration of the marriage before an official clerk of the civil administration (both spouses affirming their will to marry) the procedure to make a marriage legally valid and effective, and reduced the clerical marriage to a private ceremony.

Fornication is sometimes socially discouraged or even criminalized. Sex with a married person other than one's spouse, called [[w:adultery|adultery]], is generally condemned by most religions and has even been criminalized in some countries. Despite this condemnation, it is a widespread practice. About 10-15% of women and 20-25% of men in the U.S. engage in extramarital sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements1994&quot;&gt;Clements, M. 1994.

==New Developments in Families==
===One-Parent Households===
One recent trend illustrating the changing nature of families is the rise in prevalence of single-parent or one-parent households.  While somewhat more common prior to the 20th century due to the more frequent deaths of spouses, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the nuclear family (husband, wife, and kids) became the societal norm in most Western nations.  But what was the prevailing norm for much of the 20th century is no longer the actual norm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2006&quot;&gt;Roberts, S. (2006). It’s Official: To Be Married Means to Be Outnumbered. The New York Times. Retrieved October 15, 2006, from http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/us/15census.html&lt;/ref&gt; nor is it perceived as such.

In the 1950s, most people believed that single-parent households were &quot;immoral,&quot; but by 1978, only 25% of Americans held that belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;/&gt;  Legal reforms in the 1960s and 1970s expanded the rights of nonmarital children and unwed mothers, breaking down the distinction between &quot;legitimate&quot; and &quot;illegitimate&quot;.  Additionally, the declining purchasing power of male wages in the 1970s along with the increased levels of education among women led to an increasing percentage of married women (with and without kids) to enter the workforce. This change in the economic structure of the U.S. (i.e., the inability to support a nuclear family on a single wage), had significant ramifications on family life.  Women and men began delaying the age of first marriage in order to invest in their earning power before marriage by spending more time in school.  The increased levels of education among women - women now earn more than 50% of bachelor's degrees - positioned women to survive, economically, without the support of a husband.  By 1997, 40% of births to unmarried American women were intentional, and, despite a still prominent gender gap in pay, women are able to survive as single mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;/&gt;

However, despite their ability to support their children, single parents often struggle financially to make ends meet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutchler2009&quot;&gt;Mutchler, Jan E., and Lindsey A. Baker. 2009. “The Implications of Grandparent Coresidence for Economic Hardship Among Children in Mother-Only Families.” Journal of Family Issues 0192513X09340527.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence, however, that when single parents move in with their parents (i.e., the child's grandparents), the odds of the single-parent led family falling under the poverty line are reduced by 80%.  Thus, three generation households are more financially secure environments for raising children than are two generation households if it is a single parent who is trying to raise children alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutchler2009&quot;/&gt;

===Cohabitation===
[[File:Household types in the us 2006.png|thumb|right|300px|This figure shows that roughly 5% of households in the U.S. are made up of cohabiting couples of various types: heterosexual, gay, or lesbian.]]

[[w:Cohabitation|Cohabitation]] is an intimate relationship which includes a common living place and which exists without the benefit of legal, cultural, or religious sanction.  It can be seen as an alternative form of marriage, in that, in practice, it is similar to marriage, but it does not receive the same formal recognition by religions, governments, or cultures.

The cohabiting population, although inclusive of all ages, is mainly made up of those between the ages of 25 and 34.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday2005&quot;&gt;USA Today. July 17, 2005. Cohabitation is replacing dating. http://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2005-07-17-cohabitation_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Several common reasons that lead couples to decide to live together include: 
*wanting to test compatibility or establish financial security before marrying
*a desire to live as married when [[w:same-sex marriages|same-sex marriages]] are not legal
*living with someone before marriage as a way to avoid divorce
*a way for polygamists to avoid anti-polygamy laws
*a way to avoid the higher income taxes paid by some 2-income married couples (in the United States)
*seeing little difference between the commitment to live together and the commitment of marriage

[[File:Us births by mother's living situation.png|right|thumb|300px|This figure illustrates that, while the number of children being born to &quot;unwed&quot; mothers has increased over time, many of those children are born to women who are cohabiting.]]

While cohabitation does address all of the issues above, it does not improve the quality or duration of marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades2009&quot;&gt;Rhoades, Galena K., Scott M. Stanley, and Howard J. Markman. 2009. “The pre-engagement cohabitation effect: A replication and extension of previous findings..” Journal of Family Psychology 23:107-111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who cohabit before engagement (about 43% of all couples) report slightly lower marital satisfaction, dedication, and confidence as well as more negative communication as compared with individuals who cohabit after engagement (16.4% of all couples in the US) and those who cohabit after marriage (40.5% of couples in the US).  Early cohabitors also have a great potential for divorce.  The differences are generally small, but are not attributable to demographic differences between the three groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades2009&quot;/&gt;

Some couples prefer cohabitation because it does not legally commit them for an extended period of time, and because it is easier to establish and dissolve.  In some countries (such as [[w:Scotland|Scotland]]) and some states in the United States, cohabiting is viewed as a legal relationship and is referred to as a [[w:common-law marriage|common-law marriage]] after the duration of a specified period or the birth of a child to the couple. In California, such couples are defined as people who &quot;have chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring,&quot; including having a &quot;common residence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaliforniaCode&quot;&gt;See California Family Code Section 297 http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=297-297.5&lt;/ref&gt; This recognition led to the creation of a Domestic Partners Registry,&lt;ref name=&quot;DomesticPR&quot;&gt;http://www.ss.ca.gov/dpregistry &quot;Domestic Partners Registry&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which is available to same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples in which at least one of the partners is age 62 or older, granting them limited legal recognition and some rights similar to those of married couples. Today, seven states (North Carolina, Mississippi, Virginia, West Virginia, Florida, Idaho and Michigan) still criminalize cohabitation by opposite-sex couples, although anti-cohabitation laws are generally not enforced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wetzel1997&quot;&gt;Wetzel, Dale. 1997. Anti-Cohabitation Law Repealed. Time Magazine. March 1st, 2007. http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1595319,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In most States of the United States, there is no legal registration or definition of cohabitation, so demographers have developed various methods of identifying cohabitation and measuring its prevalence.  The most important of these is the [[w:Census|Census Bureau]], which currently describes an &quot;unmarried partner&quot; as &quot;A person age 15 years and over, who is not related to the householder, who shares living quarters, and who has a close personal relationship with the householder.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusHTR&quot;&gt;http://www.census.gov/acs/www/UseData/Def/Hhld_rel.htm &quot;Household Type and Relationship&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1995, the Bureau euphemistically identified any &quot;unrelated&quot; opposite-sex couple living with no other adults as [[w:POSSLQ|POSSLQ]]s, or Persons of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters (these numbers are still reported to show historical trends).&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusDE&quot;&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html &quot;Current Population Survey (CPS) - Definitions and Explanations&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohabitation often does not have clear start and end dates, as people move in and out of each other's homes and sometimes do not agree on the definition of their living arrangement at a particular moment in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning2005&quot;&gt;Manning, Wendy D. and Pamela J. Smock. 2005. &quot;Measuring and Modeling Cohabitation: New Perspectives from Qualitative Data.&quot; Journal of Marriage and Family 67(4):989-1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 4.85 million cohabiting couples, up more than 1,000 percent from 1960, when there were 439,000 such couples.&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusHTR&quot;/&gt; More than half of couples in the US lived together, at least briefly, before walking down the aisle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades2009&quot;/&gt; In [[w:Sweden|Sweden]], [[w:Denmark|Denmark]] and [[w:Norway|Norway]], cohabitation is very common; roughly 50% of all children are born into families of unmarried couples. In late 2005, 21% of families in [[w:Finland|Finland]] consisted of cohabiting couples (all age groups). Of couples with children, 18% were cohabiting. Generally, cohabitation amongst Finns is most common for people under 30. Legal obstacles for cohabitation were removed in 1926 in a reform of the Finnish penal code. In the [[w:UK|UK]] 25% of children are now born to cohabiting parents. In [[w:France|France]], 17.5% of couples were cohabiting as of 1999. In contrast to Europe and the U.S., cohabitation rates in the Middles East are much lower.  In Israel, less than 3% of all couples cohabit.{{fact}} Cohabitation runs contrary to Islamic Law and is not common in predominantly Muslim countries.{{fact}}

===Same-Sex Unions===
[[Image:Hendricks-leboeuf.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A homosexual couple at their marriage ceremony.]]

While homosexuality has existed for thousands of years among both humans and other animals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagemihl1999&quot;&gt;Bagemihl, Bruce. 1999. Biological exuberance: Animal homosexuality and natural diversity. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; formal marriages between homosexual partners is a relatively recent phenomenon. As of 2009, only two states in the United States recognized marriages between same-sex partners, Massachusetts &amp; Iowa, where same-sex marriage was formally allowed as of May 17, 2004 and April 2009, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLAAD2004 &quot;&gt;GLAAD. 2004. Marriage Equality for Same-Sex Couples. http://www.glaad.org/media/resource_kit_detail.php?id=3457  (Accessed February 25,2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Three additional states allow same-sex [[w:civil union|civil unions]], New Jersey, Connecticut, and Vermont.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetOut2007&quot;&gt;PlanetOut. 2007. New Jersey Gays Make It Legal. http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?date=2007/02/22/1&amp;navpath=/news/ (Accessed February 25, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Between May 2004 and December 2006, 7,341 same-sex couples married in Massachusetts.  Assuming the percentage of homosexuals in Massachusetts is similar to that of the rest of the nation (roughly 2.3% of men and 1.3% of women), the above number indicates that 16.7% of homosexuals in Massachusetts married during that time.

[[Image:Samesex marriage in USA.svg|right|thumb|200px|U.S. map showing same-sex marriage laws for individual states.]]

Given how recent same-sex marriage is in the U.S., there is very little existing data on marital dissolution rates.  There is, however, data on marital dissolution rates (i.e., divorce) in other countries where same-sex marriage has been legally allowed for a longer period of time. Andersson et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson2006&quot;&gt;Andersson, Gunnar; Noack, Turid; Seierstad, Ane; and Weedon-Fekjaer, Harold. 2006. The Demographics of Same-Sex Marriages in Norway and Sweden. Demography. 43:1, 79-98.&lt;/ref&gt; examined precisely this issue in Norway and Sweden, where same-sex marriages or civil unions have been legally recognized since the mid-1990s.  Andersson et al. found several ways in which homosexual unions differ from heterosexual unions in these countries:

[[Image:World_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg|right|thumb|200px|World map illustrating laws regulating homosexuality by country.]]

*the average same-sex couple is older than the average heterosexual couple
*the average same-sex couple is more educated than the average heterosexual couple
*while divorce rates are higher for couples that marry younger generally (see discussion of divorce above), the divorce rate is slightly higher for same-sex couples than heterosexual couples
*female same-sex couples are more likely to divorce than are male same-sex couples

Andersson et al. attribute the higher divorce rate to a combination of factors, including: less support from the community and less encouragement or pressure from family and friends to make the marriage last.

One question often raised about same-sex unions is how it influences any children raised in these households. Are children raised by same-sex parents more likely to be homosexual? The answer is surprising to some: No. Children raised in same-sex parented households are no more or less likely to be homosexual than children raised in heterosexual parented households.  Even so, there are some differences. For instance, children raised in same-sex households have more complex perspectives on sexuality and have well-articulated responses to discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien2006&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Jodi. 2006. All Aboard the Good Ship (Gay) Family Values. Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds. 5:4, 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childfree===
Some married couples remain [[w:childfree|childless by choice]] or due to [[w:infertility|infertility]], age, or other factors preventing reproduction.

==Recommended Reading==
Some couples have made a concerted effort to balance home and work responsibilities so they literally split everything 50/50.  Yet, doing so is difficult.  This [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15parenting-t.html New York Times Magazine] article examines this relatively new trend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''Social movements''' are any broad social alliances of people who are connected through their shared interest in blocking or affecting social change.  Social movements do not have to be formally organized.  Multiple alliances may work separately for common causes and still be considered a social movement.

A distinction is drawn between social movements and ''social movement organizations'' (SMOs).  A social movement organization is a formally organized component of a social movement.  But an SMO may only make up a part of a particular social movement.  For instance, [[w:People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals|PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) advocates for vegan lifestyles along with its other aims.  But PETA is not the only group to advocate for vegan diets and lifestyles; there are numerous other groups actively engaged toward this end (see [[w:vegan|vegan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer2002&quot;&gt;Maurer, Donna. 2002. Vegetarianism: Movement or Moment? Philadelphia: Temple University Press. ISBN 156639936X&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the social movement may be a push toward veganism (an effort with numerous motivations)&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer2002&quot;/&gt; and PETA is an SMO working within the broader social movement.

Modern social movements became possible through the wider dissemination of literature and increased mobility of labor due to the industrialization of societies.  Organised social structures like modern day armies, political societies, and popular movements required freedom of expression, education and relative economic independence. 

Giddens&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddens1985&quot;&gt;Giddens, Anthony. 1985. The Nation-State and Violence. Cambridge, England: Polity Press. ISBN 0520060393&lt;/ref&gt; has identified four areas in which social movements operate in modern societies:
#democratic movements that work for political rights
#labor movements that work for control of the workplace
#ecological movements that are concerned with the environment
#peace movements that work toward, well, peace

It is also interesting to note that social movements can spawn counter movements.  For instance, the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a number of counter movements that attempted to block the goals of the women's movement, many of which were reform movements within conservative religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1997&quot;&gt;Chaves, Mark. 1997. Ordaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. ISBN 0674641469&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Social Movements==
Aberle&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberle1966&quot;&gt;Aberle, David F. 1966. The Peyote Religion among the Navaho. Chicago: Aldine. ISBN 0806123826&lt;/ref&gt; described four types of social movements based upon two characteristics: (1) who is the movement attempting to change and (2) how much change is being advocated.  Social movements can be aimed at change on an individual level (e.g., [[w:Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]]) or change on a broader, group or even societal level (e.g., [[w:anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]]).  Social movements can also advocate for minor changes (e.g., tougher restrictions on drunk driving; see [[w:Mothers_Against_Drunk_Driving|MADD]]) or radical changes (e.g., [[w:prohibition|prohibition]]).

==Stages in Social Movements==
Blumer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumer1969&quot;&gt;Blumer, Herbert G. 1969. &quot;Collective Behavior.&quot; In Alfred McClung Lee, ed., Principles of Sociology. Third Edition. New York: Barnes and Noble Books, pp. 65-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mauss,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mauss1975&quot;&gt;Mauss, Armand L. 1975. Social Problems of Social Movements. Philadelphia: Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tilly&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilly1978&quot;&gt;Tilly, Charles. 1978. From Mobilization to Revolution. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; have described different stages social movements often pass through. Movements emerge for a variety of reasons (see the theories below), coalesce, and generally bureaucratize.  At that point, they can take a number of paths, including: finding some form of movement success, failure, co-optation of leaders, repression by larger groups (e.g., government), or even the establishment of the movement within the mainstream.  

Whether these paths will result in movement decline or not varies from movement to movement.  In fact, one of the difficulties in studying social movements is that movement success is often ill-defined because movement goals can change.  For instance, [http://www.moveon.org MoveOn.org], a website founded in the late 1990s, was originally developed to encourage national politicians to move past the Clinton impeachment proceedings (see [http://www.moveon.org/about/ here]). Since that time, the group has developed into a major player in national politics in the U.S. and developed into a [[w:Political Action Committee|Political Action Committee or PAC]]. In this instance, the movement may or may not have attained its original goal - encouraging the censure of Clinton and moving on to more pressing issues - but the goals of the SMO have changed.  This makes the actual stages the movement has passed through difficult to discern.

[[image:Stages of social movements.svg|center|thumb|400px]]

==Social Movement Theories==
A variety of theories have attempted to explain how social movements develop.  Some of the better-known approaches are outlined below. 

===Deprivation Theory===
''Deprivation Theory'' argues that social movements have their foundations among people who feel deprived of some good(s) or resource(s).  According to this approach, individuals who are lacking some good, service, or comfort are more likely to organize a social movement to improve (or defend) their conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrison1978&quot;&gt;Morrison, Denton E. 1978. &quot;Some Notes toward Theory on Relative Deprivation, Social Movements, and Social Change.&quot; In Louis E. Genevie, ed., Collective Behavior and Social Movements. Itasca, Ill.: Peacock. pp. 202-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two significant problems with this theory.  First, since most people feel deprived at one level or another almost all the time, the theory has a hard time explaining why the groups that form social movements do when other people are also deprived.  Second, the reasoning behind this theory is circular - often the only evidence for deprivation is the social movement. If deprivation is claimed to be the cause but the only evidence for such is the movement, the reasoning is circular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins1977&quot;&gt;Jenkins, J. Craig and Perrow, Charles. 1977. Insurgency of the Powerless Farm Worker Movements (1946-1972). American Sociological Review. 42(2):249-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass-Society Theory===
''Mass-Society Theory'' argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached.  Social movements, according to this theory, provide a sense of empowerment and belonging that the movement members would otherwise not have.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kornhauser1959&quot;&gt;Kornhauser, William. 1959. The Politics of Mass Society. New York: Free Press. ISBN 0029176204&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little support has been found for this theory.  Aho,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aho1990&quot;&gt;Aho, James Alfred. 1990. Politics of Righteousness: Idaho Christian Patriotism. Washington: University of Washington Press. ISBN 0295969970&lt;/ref&gt; in his study of Idaho Christian Patriotism, did not find that members of that movement were more likely to have been socially detached.  In fact, the key to joining the movement was having a friend or associate who was a member of the movement.

===Structural-Strain Theory===
''Structural-Strain Theory'' proposes six factors that encourage social movement development:&lt;ref name=&quot;Smelser1962&quot;&gt;Smelser, Neil J. 1962. Theory of Collective Behavior. New York: Free Press. ISBN 0029293901&lt;/ref&gt;
#structural conduciveness - people come to believe their society has problems
#structural strain - people experience deprivation
#growth and spread of a solution - a solution to the problems people are experiencing is proposed and spreads
#precipitating factors - discontent usually requires a catalyst (often a specific event) to turn it into a social movement
#lack of social control - the entity that is to be changed must be at least somewhat open to the change; if the social movement is quickly and powerfully repressed, it may never materialize
#mobilization - this is the actual organizing and active component of the movement; people do what needs to be done

This theory is also subject to circular reasoning as it incorporates, at least in part, deprivation theory and relies upon it, and social/structural strain for the underlying motivation of social movement activism.  However, social movement activism is, like in the case of deprivation theory, often the only indication that there was strain or deprivation.

===Resource-Mobilization Theory===
''Resource-Mobilization Theory'' emphasizes the importance of resources in social movement development and success. Resources are understood here to include: knowledge, money, media, labor, solidarity, legitimacy, and internal and external support from power elite.  The theory argues that social movements develop when individuals with grievances are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.  The emphasis on resources offers an explanation why some discontented/deprived individuals are able to organize while others are not.

Some of the assumptions of the theory include:
*there will always be grounds for protest in modern, politically pluralistic societies because there is constant discontent (i.e., grievances or deprivation); this de-emphasizes the importance of these factors as it makes them ubiquitous
*actors are rational; they weigh the costs and benefits from movement participation
*members are recruited through networks; commitment is maintained by building a collective identity and continuing to nurture interpersonal relationships
*movement organization is contingent upon the aggregation of resources
*social movement organizations require resources and continuity of leadership
*social movement entrepreneurs and protest organizations are the catalysts which transform collective discontent into social movements; social movement organizations form the ''backbone'' of social movements
*the form of the resources shapes the activities of the movement (e.g., access to a TV station will result in the extensive use TV media)
*movements develop in contingent ''opportunity structures'' that influence their efforts to mobilize; as each movement's response to the opportunity structures depends on the movement's organization and resources, there is no clear pattern of movement development nor are specific movement techniques or methods universal

Critics of this theory argue that there is too much of an emphasize on resources, especially financial resources.  Some movements are effective without an influx of money and are more dependent upon the movement members for time and labor (e.g., the civil rights movement in the U.S.).

===Political Process Theory===
''Political Process Theory'' is similar to resource mobilization in many regards, but tends to emphasize a different component of social structure that is important for social movement development: political opportunities.  Political process theory argues that there are three vital components for movement formation: insurgent consciousness, organizational strength, and political opportunities.

Insurgent consciousness refers back to the ideas of deprivation and grievances.  The idea is that certain members of society feel like they are being mistreated or that somehow the system is unjust.  The insurgent consciousness is the collective sense of injustice that movement members (or potential movement members) feel and serves as the motivation for movement organization.

Organizational strength falls inline with resource-mobilization theory, arguing that in order for a social movement to organize it must have strong leadership and sufficient resources.

Political opportunity refers to the receptivity or vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge.  This vulnerability can be the result of any of the following (or a combination thereof):
*growth of political pluralism
*decline in effectiveness of repression
*elite disunity; the leading factions are internally fragmented
*a broadening of access to institutional participation in political processes
*support of organized opposition by elites

One of the advantages of the political process theory is that it addresses the issue of timing or emergence of social movements.  Some groups may have the insurgent consciousness and resources to mobilize, but because political opportunities are closed, they will not have any success.  The theory, then, argues that all three of these components are important.

Critics of the political process theory and resource-mobilization theory point out that neither theory discusses movement culture to any great degree.  This has presented culture theorists an opportunity to expound on the importance of culture.

One advance on the political process theory is the ''political mediation model,'' which outlines the way in which the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in terms of success or failure but also in terms of consequences (whether intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in terms of [[w:collective benefits|collective benefits]].

===Culture Theory===
''Culture theory'' builds upon both the political process and resource-mobilization theories but extends them in two ways.  First, it emphasizes the importance of movement culture. Second, it attempts to address the ''[[w:free rider problem|free-rider problem]]''.  

Both resource-mobilization theory and political process theory include a sense of injustice in their approaches.  Culture theory brings this sense of injustice to the forefront of movement creation by arguing that, in order for social movements to successfully mobilize individuals, they must develop an ''injustice frame''.  An injustice frame is a collection of ideas and symbols that illustrate both how significant the problem is as well as what the movement can do to alleviate it,

:&quot;Like a picture frame, an issue frame marks off some part of the world.  Like a building frame, it holds things together.  It provides coherence to an array of symbols, images, and arguments, linking them through an underlying organizing idea that suggests what is essential - what consequences and values are at stake. We do not see the frame directly, but infer its presence by its characteristic expressions and language.  Each frame gives the advantage to certain ways of talking and thinking, while it places others out of the picture.&quot; (p. 14) &lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2006&quot;&gt;Ryan, Charlotte and Gamson, William W. The Art of Reframing Political Debates. Contexts. 2006; 5(1):13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few things we know about injustice frames:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2006&quot;/&gt;
*Facts take on their meaning by being embedded in frames, which render them relevant and significant or irrelevant and trivial.
*People carry around multiple frames in their heads.
*Successful reframing involves the ability to enter into the worldview of our adversaries.
*All frames contain implicit or explicit appeals to moral principles.
 
In emphasizing the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the free-rider problem.  The free-rider problem refers to the idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating.  In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement.  If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits - this is ''free-riding''.  A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution.  Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.

Framing processes includes three separate components:
*Diagnostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the problem or what they are critiquing
*Prognostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the desirable solution to the problem
*Motivational frame: the movement organization frames a &quot;call to arms&quot; by suggesting and encouraging that people take action to solve the problem

'''UNDER CONSTRUCTION'''

'''Human sexuality''' is how people experience the erotic and express themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rathus2007&quot;&gt;Rathus, Spencer A., Jeffrey S. Nevid, and Lois Fichner-Rathus. 2007. Human Sexuality in a World of Diversity. Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality has many aspects.
Biologically, sexuality refers to the reproductive mechanism as well as the basic biological drive that exists in all species and can encompass sexual intercourse and sexual contact in all its forms.
There are also emotional or physical aspect of sexuality, which refers to the bond that exists between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions, and which may be manifested in physical or medical concerns about the physiological or even psychological aspects of sexual behaviour.  Sociologically it can cover the cultural, political, and legal aspects; and philosophically, it can span the moral, ethical, theological, spiritual or religious aspects.

Recent studies on human sexuality have highlighted that sexual aspects are of major importance in building up personal identity and to social evolution of individuals:
&lt;blockquote&gt; “Human sexuality is not simply imposed by instinct or stereotypical conducts, as it happens in animals, but it is influenced both by superior mental activity and by social, cultural, educational and normative characteristics of those places where the subjects grow up and their personality develops. Consequently, the analysis of sexual sphere must be based on the convergence of several lines of development such as affectivity, emotions and relations”.&lt;ref name= Boccadoro &gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S. (2009) ''Il posto dell'amore negato. Sessualità e psicopatologie segrete'' ([http://www.sexology.it/abstract_english.html The place of the denied love. Sexuality and secret psychopathologies]). Tecnoprint Editrice, Ancona. &lt;small&gt;ISBN 978-88-95554-03-7&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many historical eras, recovered art and artefacts help to portray human sexuality of the time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rathus2007&quot;/&gt;

==Factors Influencing Human Sexuality==
Human sexuality can be influenced by hormonal changes in the development of the fetus during pregnancy. Some claim its manner of expression is largely due to genetic predisposition. Others say it is due to one's own personal experimentation in early life, and thus the establishment of preferences. A less divisive approach recognizes that both factors may have a mutual role to play.
A primary criticism of the idea that homosexuality is at least in part genetically determined is the fact that homosexual men are less likely to procreate, which means any genes that contribute to their sexual identity will not be passed on to offspring, suggesting the genes that contribute to their homosexual identity will die with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasey2010&quot;&gt;http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/02/04/study.reveals.potential.evolutionary.role.same.sex.attraction&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent research has found that homosexuality may follow a &quot;[[w:Kin selection|kin selection]]&quot; evolutionary model.  The basic idea of kin selection is that some individuals may not procreate, but they will work to facilitate the procreation of their relatives and the survival of their relatives' offspring. By facilitating the success of their siblings' offspring, they are, indirectly, insuring the reproduction of their genes. In one study examining this idea, the [[w:fa'afafine|fa'afafine]] of [[w:Samoa|Samoa]], gay men who are considered a distinct gender category apart from either men or women, were found to in fact be more involved in the lives of their nieces and nephews than were heterosexual aunts and uncles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasey2010&quot;/&gt;  This research supports the kin selection model of sexual identity and helps explain why there is a genetic component to homosexuality even though homosexuals are less likely than heterosexuals to procreate.

Human sexuality can also be understood as part of the social life of humans, governed by implied rules of behaviour and the ''status quo''.  Thus, it is claimed, sexuality influences social norms and society in turn influences the manner in which sexuality can be expressed. Since the invention of the mass media, sexuality has further moulded the environments in which we live; it comes to be distilled (often into stereotypes) and then repeatedly expressed in commercialized forms such as print, audio and film.

Human sexuality is distinguished from gender identity.  Gender identity is a more expansive set of roles than sexual identity.  Gender can usually be moulded by the social environment to which one is exposed as a child, e.g. an authority figure giving a little boy a toy truck to play with, and a girl a doll. Human physiology and gender moulding thus makes certain forms of sexual expression possible or even likely, but it does not predict that future sexual behaviour will be regarded as 'gender appropriate'.

Human sexual choices are usually made using current cultural norms. For example; some may choose to abstain from sex before marriage because their religion forbids such actions. In some cultures it may be acceptable for a man to have many wives, while in others bigamy or polygamy is frowned upon.  Those who wish to express a dissident sexuality often form sub-cultures, within the main culture.

==Theories of Human Sexuality==
===Sociobiology===
One study supporting sociobiological understandings of human sexuality found evidence for this in the responses of heterosexual men to &quot;cheating&quot; by their female partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confer2011&quot;&gt;Confer, Jaime C., and Mark D. Cloud. 2011. “Sex differences in response to imagining a partner's heterosexual or homosexual affair.” Personality and Individual Differences 50:129-134.&lt;/ref&gt;  If their female partners cheated with a man, they are less likely to continue dating her, than if she cheated with a woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confer2011&quot;/&gt;  This suggests that the bigger issue with cheating - for men - is not the sexual or emotional intimacy but the threat to paternity; men do not want to be cuckolded into raising another man's child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confer2011&quot;/&gt;

==Sexuality and the Life Course==
===Childhood===

===Adolescence===
Recent research has found that there is a genetic predisposition in 20 to 30 percent of Caucasian women for [[w:premenstrual dysphoric disorder|premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD; commonly referred to as [[w:PMS|PMS]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer2010&quot;&gt;Spencer, J. L., E. M. Waters, T. A. Milner, F. S. Lee, and B. S. McEwen. 2010. “BDNF variant Val66Met interacts with estrous cycle in the control of hippocampal function.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; While the research was conducted on mice, mice and humans share the same gene.  Basically, mice with this particular gene are more irritable and insecure during certain phases of their estrous cycle (the equivalent of the human menstrual cycle).  Their memory is also impaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer2010&quot;/&gt;  These findings suggest that this may be part of the cause of PMDD in women with this gene variant.

Some groups have expressed concern over the effect of vaccinating young women against the [[w:Human papillomavirus|Human papillomavirus]], believing that it may increase their sexual activity as they may not be worried about contracting HPV.  Recent research suggests vaccinating young women against HPV did not effect sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bednarczyk2012&quot;&gt;Bednarczyk, R. A., Davis, R., Ault, K., Orenstein, W., &amp; Omer, S. B. (2012). Sexual Activity–Related Outcomes After Human Papillomavirus Vaccination of 11- to 12-Year-Olds. Pediatrics. doi:10.1542/peds.2012-1516&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescent females who had been vaccinated against HPV were no more or less likely to engage in sexual activity than were young women who were not vaccinated.

===Adulthood===
===Elderly===

==Differences in Sexuality Between Men and Women==
One notable difference between men and women when it comes to sexuality is men's greater interest in casual sex.  Men are far more interested in casual sex than are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schützwohl2009&quot;&gt;Schützwohl, Achim, Amrei Fuchs, William McKibbin, and Todd Shackelford. n.d. “How Willing Are You to Accept Sexual Requests from Slightly Unattractive to Exceptionally Attractive Imagined Requestors?.” Human Nature. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12110-009-9067-3 (Accessed August 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with their greater interest in casual sex, men are less discriminating in their sexual partners than are women.  Women are more likely to engage in casual sex when their potential male partner is extremely attractive, but substantially less so when their partner is even moderately attractive.

As is the case with many other aspects of social life, women are also mistreated when it comes to sex.  One study found that young women and teenage girls often face efforts by male partners to sabotage birth control (including damaging condoms).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan2009&quot;&gt;Chan, Ronna L., and Sandra L. Martin. 2009. “Physical and sexual violence and subsequent contraception use among reproductive aged women.” Contraception 80:276-281.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as &quot;reproductive coercion&quot; and is often associated with physical or sexual violence.  Approximately 1 in 5 young women have experienced reproductive coercion and over 50% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner.  The motivation of such violence and coercion is typically power and control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan2009&quot;/&gt;

Another difference that exists between men and women is an advantage some men gain by combining three traits (a.k.a. &quot;the dark triad&quot;): narcisissism, thrill-seeking, and deceit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonason2009&quot;&gt;Jonason, P. K.. Li, N. P., Webster, G. W., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (2009). The Dark Triad: Facilitating short-term mating in men. European Journal of Personality, 23, 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the men who exhibit these traits are not particularly prevalent in society, those men who do exhibit these traits do, in fact, have more success in short-term mating than do men who do not exhibit these traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonason2009&quot;/&gt;  In other words, it is at least somewhat true that &quot;bad guys do get the most girls.&quot;

==Cultural Variations in Sexuality==
Recent research has found that most parents in the US have a hard time believing that their children are interested in sex.  However, they do believe that most other kids are interested in sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliott2012&quot;&gt;Elliott, Sinikka. 2012. Not My Kid: What Parents Believe about the Sex Lives of Their Teenagers. New York: New York University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, most parents are wrong, but this leads them to believe that their children are innocent and that their entrance into sexual activity is the result of persuasion by others and not because their children want to engage in sex.

American parents also depict sex among teenagers as something to be feared and they often forbid it.  However, Dutch parents take a completely different approach, talking to their kids about sex and even encouraging them to have sex when they are ready.  Dutch parents go so far as to encourage their children to have sex in the parents' home when they are ready to ensure it is a safe and pleasant experience.  In fact, nine out of ten Dutch parents are okay with their teenage children having sex in their home, while nine out of ten parents in the US are opposed to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schalet2011&quot;&gt;Schalet, Amy T. 2011. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These differences in sexual attitudes result in much lower rates of birth control use in the US (26%) than in Holland (63%) and much higher rates of regret (63% of boys and 69% of girls in the US which they had waited while just 5% and 20% of boys and girls in the Netherlands wish they had).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schalet2011&quot;/&gt;  Another consequence of the attitudes about sexuality in the US is three times higher teenage pregnancy rates than in Holland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schalet2011&quot;/&gt;

==Having Sex==
Having sex is associated with better health and people who are in better health have more sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindau2010&quot;&gt;Lindau, S. T., and N. Gavrilova. 2010. “Sex, health, and years of sexually active life gained due to good health: evidence from two US population based cross sectional surveys of ageing.” BMJ 340:c810-c810.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, 38.9% of men and 16.8% of women between 75 and 85 were sexually active, and this was closely tied to health, with healthier individuals reporting greater interest in and greater frequency of sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindau2010&quot;/&gt;  In that same study the authors found that the sexually active life expectancy of 30 year-olds also varied by sex, for men it was 34.7 years and for women it was 30.7 years.  Men also express greater interest in sex and have more sex than do women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindau2010&quot;/&gt;

Some forms of contraceptive have been shown to reduce sexual pleasure.  Women who use both condoms and hormonal birth control measures report the highest levels of sexual satisfaction while women who use condoms alone reported the lowest levels of sexual enjoyment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higgins2008&quot;&gt;Higgins, J.A., S. Hoffman, C.A. Graham, and S.A. Sanders. 2008. “Relationships between condoms, hormonal methods, and sexual pleasure and satisfaction: an exploratory analysis from the Women’s Well-Being and Sexuality Study.” Sex. Health 5:321-330.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are side effects to various forms of contraception, one side effect that is oft-repeated - weight gain associated with the birth control pill - has recently been shown to be unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelman2011&quot;&gt;Edelman, A., J.T. Jensen, M. Bulechowsky, and J. Cameron. 2011. “Combined oral contraceptives and body weight: do oral contraceptives cause weight gain? A primate model.” Human Reproduction 26:330-336.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the opposite may be true - using the birth control pill appears to increase the basal metabolic rate (in monkeys), which can lead to weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelman2011&quot;/&gt;

Some women (research is lacking on men) suffer from what is called &quot;postcoital dysphoria,&quot; or negative feelings following what is otherwise satisfactory intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird2011&quot;&gt;Bird, Brian S., Robert D. Schweitzer, and Donald S. Strassberg. 2011. “The Prevalence and Correlates of Postcoital Dysphoria in Women.” International Journal of Sexual Health 23(1):14–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons why some women experience postcoital dysphoria are not entirely clear, but in one study it was about 10% of women who reported this feeling some or most of the time after sex (about 1/3 reported it at least occasionally).

==Sex Work==
There are many forms of sex work, ranging from the adult film industry to prostitution.

A popular perception of prostitution is that it is an &quot;unqualified evil&quot; and is oppressive to women.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;&gt;weitzer, ronald. 2007. “prostitution: facts and fictions.” Contexts 6:28-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  While that perception is true for some prostitutes, it is not true for the majority of prostitutes and is not at all descriptive of prostitutes in locations where prostitution is legal.  Those who believe the &quot;oppressive model&quot; of prostitution is true, generally believe that most prostitutes were sexually abused as children, they were forced into prostitution, usually as young adolescents, they are controlled by pimps, they are drug addicts, they are treated violently, their working conditions are awful, and that legalization would make the situation worse.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  Much of this perception is based on the media and the attention given to street prostitution, which differs dramatically from indoor prostitution.  Street prostitutes are engaged in a dangerous profession: 27% have been assaulted, 37% have been robbed, and 22% have been raped.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  However, very few were forced into this by a pimp, and rarely did they start in early adolescence (less than 20% started prior to age 16).  Some are addicted to drugs and use prostitution to support their habit; those who are using intravenous drugs are more likely to have HIV/AIDS, but those who are not are unlikely to be HIV positive.  Also, there is very little evidence to suggest street prostitutes were more likely to have been sexually assaulted as children.  But only 20% of prostitutes in the U.S. are street prostitutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;

What are the working conditions like for the remaining 80% of prostitutes?  Indoor prostitutes are working in a much safer profession: 1% have been assaulted, 2% raped, and 10% robbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  In terms of physical health, indoor prostitutes are just as healthy in terms of physical health, self-esteem, mental health, and the quality of their social networks as are non-prostitute women.  In fact, some prostitutes feel empowered by their occupation.  And where prostitution is legal, prostitutes are even healthier, safer, and more satisfied with their work.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;

Interestingly, almost 50% of Americans favor legalizing prostitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  While likely understating the actual number, about 17% of men in the U.S. have paid for sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;

==Sexual Orientation or Identity==
'''Sexual orientation''' is a pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, neither gender, or another gender. According to the American Psychological Association sexual orientation also refers to a person’s sense of &quot;personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviours expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;&gt; [http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf APA California Amicus Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is usually classified according to the sex or gender of the people who are found sexually attractive. Though people may use other labels, or none at all&lt;ref name=&quot;American Psychological Association&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/topics/sorientation.html#whatis |title=Sexuality, What is sexual orientation? |periodical=American Psychological Association: ''Sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions.... Sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual...However, some people may use different labels or none at all.'' |accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. These orientations exist along a heterosexual-homosexual continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexual to exclusive homosexual, including various forms of bisexuality in-between. The continuum between heterosexual and homosexual does not suit everyone, however, as some people identify as asexual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asexuality.org/home/&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexologists see this linear scale as an oversimplification of a more nuanced notion of sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm Planned Parent Hood: Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender, LGBTQ ... The Labels and Their Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most definitions of sexual orientation include a psychological component, such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire, or a behavioural component, which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s. Some definitions include both components. Some people prefer simply to follow an individual's self-definition or identity.

Some scholars of sexology, anthropology and history have argued that social categories such as heterosexual and homosexual are not universal. Different societies may consider other criteria to be more significant than sex, including the age disparity in sexual relationships of the partners, whether partners assume an active or a passive sexual role, and their social status.

Sexual identity and sexual behaviour are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behaviour referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to &quot;fantasies, attachments and longings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiter L |title=Sexual orientation, sexual identity, and the question of choice |journal=Clinical Social Work Journal |volume=17 |pages=138–50 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;apahelp&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality |periodical=American Psychological Association|APAHelpCenter.org |accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as closeted.

''Sexual identity'' may also be used to describe a person's perception of his or her own ''sex'', rather than sexual orientation. The term ''sexual preference'' has a similar meaning to ''sexual orientation'', but is more commonly used outside of scientific circles by people who believe that sexual orientation is, in whole or part, a matter of choice.

Sexual orientation is a concept that evolved in the industrialized West and there is a controversy as to the universality of its application in other societies/ cultures. &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sFHX6uu19ZEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=sexual+orientation+is+a+western+concept&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lj2ODgARED&amp;sig=6AUpbyJbsvbyqUxbjKmnXfdZX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result The Psychology of Sexual Orientation, Behaviour, and identity] By Louis Diamant, Richard D.

Michael W. Ross &amp; Ann K. Brooks; Quote from Page 9: Chou (2000) notes in his analysis of the lack of applicability of western concepts of sexual identity in China, just because a person has a particular taste for a specific food doesn’t mean that we label them in terms of the food that they prefer. A similar approach to sexual appetite as not conferring identity may be operating in this sample. McIntosh (1968) has previously noted that people who do not identify with the classic western, white gay/lesbian role may not necessarily identify their behaviour as homosexual.&lt;/ref&gt; As Michel Foucault put it, &quot;'Sexuality' is an invention of the modern state, the industrial revolution, and capitalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dMAtGvry_IMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=china+heterosexuality+love+western&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PKv2BfyPpd&amp;sig=s43w6PzlNOgefEsjpHViwrxkM6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Chinese Femininities, Chinese Masculinities: A Reader]; By Susan Brownell, Jeffrey N.

Sexual minorities (i.e., homosexuals, bisexuals, asexuals) are about twice as likely as heterosexuals to seek mental health help or substance abuse treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grella2009&quot;&gt;Grella, Christine, Lisa Greenwell, Vickie Mays, and Susan Cochran. 2009. “Influence of gender, sexual orientation, and need on treatment utilization for substance use and mental disorders: findings from the California quality of life survey.” BMC Psychiatry 9:52.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study,&lt;ref name=&quot;Grella2009&quot;/&gt; 48.5% of lesbian/gay/bisexual individuals reported receiving treatment in the past year as compared to 22.5% of heterosexuals. In another study of LGBT youth, 30% met the criteria for a mental health disorder, but 70% did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mustanski2010&quot;&gt;Mustanski, Brian S., Robert Garofalo, and Erin M. Emerson. 2010. “Mental Health Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Suicidality in a Diverse Sample of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youths.” Am J Public Health 100:2426-2432.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 10% met the criteria for [[w:Post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and 15% met the criteria for major depression.  Additionally, 1/3 had attempted suicide at some point in their life.  While these rates are higher than for youths in national samples, they are comparable to youths in urban, racial, and ethnic minority samples.  The primary reason why it's believed sexual minorities are more likely to suffer mental health disorders and seek help at greater rates is due to the greater levels of stress they face resulting from discrimination they experience as a result of their sexual orientation. Acceptance of homosexuality has increased among Americans over the last 40 years to the point that the majority of Americans want some form of marital or civil union rights for homosexuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2006&quot;&gt;Goldberg, Michelle. 2006. Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism. 1st ed. W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to 25% of lesbian and gay teens and about 15% of bisexual teens are homeless, compared with just 3% of heterosexual teens. Additionally, homeless LGB teens are more likely than heterosexual teens to be on their own rather than with a parent or guardian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corliss2011&quot;&gt;Corliss, Heather L., Carol S. Goodenow, Lauren Nichols, and S. Bryn Austin. 2011. “High Burden of Homelessness Among Sexual-Minority Adolescents: Findings From a Representative Massachusetts High School Sample.” American Journal of Public Health 101(9):1683–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, partnership rates for lesbians are nearly the same as those for heterosexual women, but lower among gay men than among heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter2008&quot;&gt;Christopher Carpenter, and Gary J. Gates. 2008. “Gay and Lesbian Partnership: Evidence from California.” Demography 45:573-590.&lt;/ref&gt;  Homosexuals who are partnered tend to be older, are more likely to be white, and are better educated than are non-partnered gay men and lesbians.

There is no evidence to date that attempts to change someone's sexual orientation are successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2006&quot;/&gt;  What's more, there is some evidence to suggest that attempting to change sexual orientation can actually be quite harmful, increasing the risks for depression, anxiety, and self-destructive behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2006&quot;/&gt;

==Sexual Abuse==
One of the factors that increases the risk of sexual abuse in men is having experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse.  Men who have experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse are 4 1/2 times more likely to engage in sexually coercive behavior than are men who were not abused as children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey2009&quot;&gt;Casey, Erin A., Blair Beadnell, and Taryn P.

==Introduction to deviance==
'''Deviance''' is any behavior that violates cultural norms. Deviance is often divided into two types of deviant activities.  The first, crime is the violation of formally enacted laws and is referred to as ''formal deviance''.  Examples of formal deviance would include: robbery, theft, rape, murder, and assault, just to name a few.  The second type of deviant behavior refers to violations of informal social norms, norms that have not been codified into law, and is referred to as ''informal deviance''.  Examples of informal deviance might include: picking one's nose, belching loudly (in some cultures), or standing too close to another unnecessarily (again, in some cultures).  

As the last two examples in the preceding paragraph illustrate, deviance can vary quite dramatically from culture to culture.  Cultural norms are relative; this makes deviant behavior relative as well.  For instance, in general U.S. society it is uncommon for people to restrict their speech to certain hours of the day.  In the Christ Desert Monastery there are specific rules about when the residents can and cannot speak, including a specific ban on speaking between 7:30 pm and 4:00 am. The norms and rules of the Christ Desert Monastery are examples of how norms are relative to cultures. 

Current research on deviance by sociologists takes many forms.  For example, Dr. Karen Halnon of Pennsylvania State University studies how some people exercise informal deviance.  Her research focuses on what she calls &quot;deviance vacations,&quot; where people of certain socioeconomic status descend to lower strata.  For instance, heterosexual white males may become drag queens on the weekend.  It is a vacation because heterosexual white males can afford to descend temporarily and then return to the advantages of their true socioeconomic status.  Other examples include white hip-hop acts like Eminem and Nu-Metal bands like Limp Bizkit that mimic lower or middle class people in order to use their socioeconomic credentials for profit, despite their true socioeconomic status.  

Sociological interest in deviance includes both interests in measuring formal deviance (statistics of criminal behavior; see below) and a number of theories that try to explain both the role of deviance in society and its origins. This chapter will cover the theories of deviance used by sociologists and will also cover current crime statistics.

==Theories of Deviance== 
===Psychological Explanations===
While the focus of this chapter is on sociological explanations of deviance, there are explanations from other disciplines as well.  For instance, recent research in neurology and psychology finds that boys with conduct disorder have differences in their brain structure and that those differences exist during childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairchild2011&quot;&gt;Fairchild G, Passamonti L, Hurford G, Hagan CC, von dem Hagen EA, van Goozen SH, Goodyer IM, Calder AJ (2011), “Brain structure abnormalities in early-onset and adolescent-onset conduct disorder.” Am J Psychiatry 168(6):624-33&lt;/ref&gt; These differences likely contribute to their deviant behavior.

===Social-Strain Typology===
Robert K. Merton, in his discussion of deviance, proposed a typology of deviant behavior.  A typology is a classification scheme designed to facilitate understanding.  In this case, Merton was proposing a typology of deviance based upon two criteria: (1) a person's motivations or her adherence to cultural goals; (2) a person's belief in how to attain her goals.  These two criteria are shown in the diagram below.  According to Merton, there are five types of deviance based upon these criteria:

[[Image:Mertons social strain theory.svg|right|thumb|300px]]

*'''conformity''' involves the acceptance of the cultural goals and means of attaining those goals (e.g., a banker)
*'''innovation''' involves the acceptance of the goals of a culture but the rejection of the traditional and/or legitimate means of attaining those goals (e.g., a member of the Mafia values wealth but employs alternative means of attaining her wealth)
*'''ritualism''' involves the rejection of cultural goals but the routinized acceptance of the means for achieving the goals (e.g., a disillusioned bureaucrat - like Milton in the movie ''Office Space'', who goes to work everyday because it is what he does, but does not share the goal of the company of making lots of money)
*'''retreatism''' involves the rejection of both the cultural goals and the traditional means of achieving those goals (e.g., a homeless person who is homeless more by choice than by force or circumstance)
*'''rebellion''' is a special case wherein the individual rejects both the cultural goals and traditional means of achieving them but actively attempts to replace both elements of the society with different goals and means (e.g., a communist revolution)

What makes Merton's typology so fascinating is that people can turn to deviance in the pursuit of widely accepted social values and goals. For instance, individuals in the U.S. who sell illegal drugs have rejected the culturally acceptable means of making money, but still share the widely accepted cultural value in the U.S. of making money.  Thus, deviance can be the result of accepting one norm, but breaking another in order to pursue the first.

===Structural-Functionalism===
The structural-functionalist approach to deviance argues that deviant behavior plays an important role in society for several reasons. First, deviance helps distinguish between what is acceptable behavior, and what is not.  In a sense deviance is required in order for people to know what they can and cannot do.  It draws lines and demarcates boundaries. This is an important function as it affirms the cultural values and norms of a society for the members of that society. 

In addition to clarifying the moral boundaries of society, deviant behavior can also promote social unity, but it does so at the expense of the deviant individuals, who are obviously excluded from the sense of unity derived from differentiating the non-deviant from the deviants. 

Finally, and quite out of character for the structural-functionalist approach, deviance is actually seen as one means for society to change over time.  Deviant behavior can imbalance societal equilibrium.  In the process of returning societal equilibrium, society is often forced to change.  Thus, deviant behavior serves several important functions in society.

===Conflict Theory===
A clear example of how deviance reflects power imbalances is in the reporting and tracking of crimes.  ''White-collar'' crimes are typically committed by individuals in higher social classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Velez2003&quot;&gt;Velez, Maria B., Lauren J. Krivo, and Ruth D. Peterson. 2003. “Structural Inequality and Homicide: An Assessment of Black-White Gap in Killings.” Criminology 41:645-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;&gt;http://web.archive.org/20040811015632/www.fbi.gov/publications/strategicplan/stategicplantext.htm#whitecollar&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of white-collar crimes include&lt;ref&gt;http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/topics/white_collar.html&lt;/ref&gt;:
*antitrust violations
*computer, credit card, phone, telemarketing, bankruptcy, healthcare, insurance, mail, and government fraud
*tax evasion
*insider trading
*bribery and public corruption
*counterfeiting
*money laundering
*embezzlement
*economic espionage
*trade secret theft

As of 2009, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics do not provide clear statistics on white-collar crime, like they do with other types of crime.  Most of the statistics provided are estimates of losses resulting from white-collar crime, which include: 
*unclear amount of money lost from corporate crime, but totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*at least $50 billion lost every year in the U.S. from health care fraud&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*unclear amount of money lost from financial institution fraud, but totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*unclear amount of money lost from money laundering, but also totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*at least 10% of government funds for domestic programs may be lost to fraud every year, totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*unclear amount of money lost from insurance, telemarketing, and investment fraud every year, but also totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;

That such crimes are not tracked more clearly suggests that there is less of an emphasis placed on prosecuting white collar crime than there is on prosecuting other types of crime (property and violent crime) in the U.S.  It may also be the case that it is difficult to collect such statistics, but that is also likely due to the fact that a system for tracking such crimes has not been put into place because such crimes are not seen as warranting the same amount of attention as exists for other types of crimes.

That white-collar crimes are less likely to be tracked, less likely to be reported, less likely to be prosecuted, and are more likely to be committed by people in higher social classes suggests that the way crimes are punished in the U.S. tends to favor the affluent while punitively punishing the less affluent.  Additionally, men benefit more from white-collar crime than do women, as they are more likely to attempt these crimes when they are in more powerful positions, allowing them to reap greater rewards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daly1989&quot;&gt;Daly, Kathleen. 1989. “Gender and Varieties of White-Collar Crime.” Criminology 27:769-794.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling Theory===
'''Labeling Theory''' refers to the idea that individuals become deviant when two things occur: 
#a deviant label is applied to them (e.g., ''loner'', ''punk'')
#they adopt the label by exhibiting the behaviors, actions, and attitudes associated with the label
This approach to deviance recognizes its cultural relativity and is aware that deviance can result from power imbalances.  But it takes the idea of deviance further by illustrating how a deviant [[w:identity|identity]] develops through the application and adoption of labels.  Labeling theory argues that people become deviant as a result of people forcing that identity upon them and then adopting the identity.  

Labels are understood to be the names associated with identities or role-sets in society.  Examples of more innocuous labels might include ''father'' or ''lover''.  Deviant labels refer to identities that are known for falling outside of cultural norms, like ''loner'' or ''punk''.

There are two additional ideas related to the labeling theory approach to understanding deviance.  First, once a deviant identity is adopted, it is often the case that the past behaviors of the now deviant individual are re-interpreted in light of the new identity.  The process of re-casting one's past actions in light of a current identity is referred to as ''retrospective labeling''.  A very clear example of retrospective labeling can be seen in how the perpetrators of the [[w:Columbine High School massacre|Columbine High School massacre]], [[w:Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], were re-cast after the incident took place.  Much of their behavior leading up to the school shootings has been re-interpreted in light of the deviant identity with which they were labeled as a result of the shootings.

Another important element of labeling theory involves the idea of ''stigma''.  Stigma refers to the situation of the individual who is disqualified from full social acceptance because of some mark of infamy or disgrace or a label that is often difficult to hide or disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1963&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stigma extend the idea of labeling theory by illustrating how individual characteristics can be the basis for attaching labels that can be life-altering.  A good example of a stigma that is now increasingly difficult to hide is the publishing of convicted sex offender identities and information on websites ([http://www.hcso.org/PublicServices/SexOffenders/offender.asp see here for an example]).  The stigma is the past behavior - the sex offense - but this identity is relatively easily hidden as it impossible to pick a sex offender out of a crowd.  By pushing the sex offender identity into public purview, sex offenders, regardless of current behavior, are stigmatized; they are stuck with a deviant identity that overwhelms any other identity they may have.  In sum, labeling theory argues that the application of labels (role-sets) to individuals is an important element leading to deviant behavior.

==Crime Statistics==
[[Image:Adult Correctional Population - 1980-2007.png|right|thumb|250px|Adult Correctional Population in the U.S.]]

Crime statistics are usually data collected by governments for the reporting of incidents of criminal activity.  They are useful for a number of reasons, beyond simply giving an awareness of the extent of criminal activity.  Presented below are statistics on criminal activity and the criminal justice system for both the U.S. and selected nations around the world (for comparisons).  The statistics included in this section were chosen to provide a sampling of how crime statistics can be useful beyond simply reporting incidents of criminal behavior.

It is important to understand that crime statistics do not provide a perfect view of crime. Government statistics on crime only show data for crimes that have been reported to authorities. These crimes represent only a fraction of those crimes that have been acted upon by law enforcement, which in turn represents only a fraction of those crimes where people have made complaints to the police, which in turn represents only a fraction of the total crimes committed.  However, it should also be noted that television presents an unrealistic picture of the frequency of crime, particularly violent crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sparks2009&quot;&gt;Sparks, Glenn and Susan Huelsing Sarapin. October 2009. The CSI Effect: The Relationship Between Exposure to TV Crime Dramas and Perceptions of the Criminal Justice System. Paper presented at the International Crime, Media &amp; Popular Culture Studies Conference. Indian State University, Terre Haute, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavy viewers of crime dramas on TV (e.g., [[w:CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation|CSI]], [[w:Law &amp; Order|Law &amp; Order]], etc.) estimate that there are 2 1/2 times as many real world deaths due to murder than do non-viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sparks2009&quot;/&gt;  Thus, while crimes are under-reported, they do tend to receive disproportionate attention in the media, leading people to think that crime is more prevalent than it actually is.

===Incarceration Rates and Populations===
One of the more interesting features of the U.S. is the extensive number of people who are currently in the correctional system.  One explanation for this is the increasingly punitive approach of the criminal justice system. According to Western (2007)&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;/&gt;, those who break laws in the U.S. today are twice as likely to be imprisoned as criminals a generation ago.  While debated, the percentage of prison inmates who have been wrongly convicted of crimes is estimated to be somewhere between less than 1% all the way up to 9%, which could mean hundreds of thousands of prison inmates are actually innocent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liptak2008&quot;&gt;Liptak, Adam. 2008. “Consensus on Counting the Innocent: We Can’t.” The New York Times, March 25 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/us/25bar.html (Accessed March 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure to the right breaks down the correctional system population by the status of individuals in the correctional system, including:

*prison
*probation
*jail
*parole

While the population of the United States is the third largest in the world (behind China and India), the percentage of the population that is in prison is the highest in the world, as illustrated by the map below.

[[File:Prisoner population rate UN HDR 2007 2008.PNG|center|thumb|600px|Map 1. Source: http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf]]

This map illustrates that the U.S. has both a lot of people in prison in sheer numbers but also as a percentage of the population. Comparing incarceration rates by countries goes beyond just reporting incidents of criminal activity (incidents of crime are not much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere) by highlighting differences in the correctional systems of countries.  Countries differ in the restrictiveness of their laws and prison sentences.  Differences of these types are seen when comparing incarceration rates and populations.

[[Image:Recidivism 1994.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Recidivism rates in the U.S.]]

The U.S. has a relatively high [[w:recidivism|recidivism]] rate (recidivism refers to the frequency of repeat offenses).  More than half (some estimate around 67%) of prison inmates will be convicted on another charge within three years of having been released and return to prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;  This statistic is revealing of the nature of the prison system in the U.S.: it is more interested in keeping people who commit crimes away from the rest of the population than it is in attempting to reform or resocialize individuals to make them productive members of society.  One factor that contributes to the high recidivism rates is the social [[w:stigma|stigma]] that accompanies having been convicted of a [[w:felony|felony]] in the US. van Olphen et al. (2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;vanOlphen2009&quot;&gt;van Olphen, Juliana, Michele Eliason, Nicholas Freudenberg, and Marilyn Barnes. 2009. “Nowhere to go: How stigma limits the options of female drug users after release from jail.” Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 4:10.&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals convicted of drug offenses were very likely to be reincarcerated, largely due to punitive punishments that accompanied their &quot;convicted felon&quot; stigma.  For instance, they were often denied access to public housing and food stamps, which led many of the participants in the study to sell drugs to survive, leading to future arrests and convictions.  The lack of help given to convicts released from prison increases the odds of those convicts returning to prison.  Another factor that significantly increases the odds of convicts returning to prison is their return to their former neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk2009&quot;&gt;Kirk, David S. 2009. A Natural Experiment on Residential Change and Recidivism: Lessons from Hurricane Katrina. American Sociological Review. 74(3):484-500.&lt;/ref&gt;  Convicts who move away from their old neighborhood are substantially less likely to commit another crime; distancing themselves from the social environment that encouraged their criminal activity in the first place reduces their odds of reincarceration. Finally, the stigma associated with spending time in prison leads to substantially worse physical and mental health for ex-cons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massoglia2009&quot;&gt;massoglia, michael, and jason schnittker. 2009. “no real RELEASE.” Contexts 8:38-42.&lt;/ref&gt; including higher rates of chronic illness, disability, psychiatric disorders, major depression, and anxiety.

A relatively recent innovation in criminal justice that has been shown to moderately reduce recidivism rates is &quot;drug courts,&quot; or alternative sentencing systems that mandate treatment and therapy rather than jail time for drug offenses.  Drug courts appear to reduce recidivism by somewhere between 8 and 10 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2008&quot;&gt;Eckholm, Erik. 2008. “Courts Give Addicts a Chance to Straighten Out.” The New York Times, October 15 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/us/15drugs.html (Accessed February 19, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  That drug courts reduce recidivism is not all that surprising consider there is an actual intent to modify behavior rather than simply removing individuals from society.

[[Image:Justice Expenditures by Criminal Justice Functions - 1982-2006.png|center|thumb|600px|Justice Expenditures by Criminal Justice Function, 1982-2006.]]

Another interesting characteristic of the U.S. is the amount of money that is spent on the correctional system.  Policing the nations streets is the most expensive component of the correctional system, followed by housing prison inmates.  The average annual cost for one federal prisoner exceeds $20,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;  The judicial process is the least expensive, but the combined expenses of all three elements total over $200 billion annually (when you combine state, local, and federal expenditures).&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;&gt;Silver, Howard. 2008. “The Costs of Mass Incarceration Examined by Congressional Panel.” Footnotes, February 2008, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though billions of dollars are spent on the criminal justice system every year in the U.S., the financial outlays actually account for only part of the cost of mass incarceration.  Millions of additional jobs and even lives are lost as a result of the stigma that follows prison inmates when released (which also explains the high recidivism rate).  Convicted felons are barred from working in certain industries, have limited access to educational opportunities, and have limited access to welfare and housing benefits from the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;  All of these problems combine to concentrate former inmates in poor urban neighborhoods that have limited opportunities to move out of criminal circles.  Reducing the consequences of felony convictions and providing occupational and drug counseling would go a long way toward alleviating the high recidivism rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;

===Gender===
[[Image:Violent crime rates by gender 1973-2003.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Violent crime rates by gender, 1973-2003.]]

Another way crime statistics can go beyond simply reporting incidents of criminal activity is in highlighting differences between different groups.  One difference in criminal activity is seen in the number of violent crimes committed by gender (see chart).  While the difference has narrowed in recent years, men are still more likely to commit violent crimes than are women.

Another telling crime statistic that is traditionally seen as highlighting power imbalances is the number of rapes in society.  While the focus of this chapter is not on exploring the motivations behind rape, the number of rapes in the U.S. and internationally can be seen to reflect power imbalances between men and women as men are far more likely to rape women than vice versa. The figures below and to the right show that rape rates in the U.S. have declined in recent years and also compare rape rates from select countries around the world.
[[Image:Rapes per 1000 people 1973-2003.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Rape rates in the U.S. per 1000 people, 1973-2003.]]

[[Image:International rape rates 2002.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Comparison of selected countries' rape rates, 2002.]]

===Race===
Regardless of one's views on the [[w:War on Drugs|War on Drugs]] in the U.S., one thing is certain, the war disproportionately targets African Americans. Since the inception of the war on drugs in 1980, 31 million drug related arrests have been made.  African Americans are no more likely to use drugs than are whites,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2008&quot;&gt;Eckholm, Erik. 2008. “Reports Find Racial Gap in Drug Arrests.” The New York Times, May 6 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06disparities.html (Accessed February 3, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; but between 1980 and 2003, the arrest rates for African Americans for drug offenses has risen at three times the rate as it has for whites, 225% vs. 70%.&lt;ref name=&quot;King2008&quot;&gt;King, Ryan S. 2008. Disparity by Geography: The War on Drugs in America's Cities. The Sentencing Project. Washington. D.C. http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/dp_drugarrestreport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason: drug use and trafficking in the inner-city as opposed to suburbs has been the focus of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;King2008&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, penalties for using drugs that are more often found among minorities have traditionally been harsher than for drugs used by whites.  Crack and powder cocaine are very similar in effect, but possession of crack cocaine carries harsher penalties and is more likely to be used by blacks, who account for nearly 80% of crack convictions, than whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2010&quot;&gt;Eckholm, Erik. 2010. “Congress Moves to Narrow Sentencing Disparities for Crack and Powdered Cocaine.” The New York Times, July 28 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/us/politics/29crack.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss (Accessed August 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  These laws were enacted in 1986 and mandated minimum sentencing - 5 years for possessing five grams of crack; 10 years for 10 grams.  But the thresholds for powdered cocaine were 100 times as high - 500 grams of powdered cocaine got you just 5 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2010&quot;/&gt;  The discriminatory prosecution of African Americans for drug offenses is just one way in which the criminal justice system in the U.S. works against African American equality.

The criminal justice system in the U.S. has a significant impact on the life chances of racial and ethnic minorities, in particular, people of African descent. Serving time in prison has become a normative event for young, lower-class African-American males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;&gt;Western, Bruce. 2007. Punishment and Inequality in America. Russell Sage Foundation Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The average African-American, male, high-school dropout born in the 1960s in the U.S. had a nearly 60% chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s. (This probability drops precipitously for college-educated African-Americans.) A disproportionate percentage of African-Americans are in prison; African-Americans make up 12% of the U.S. population but nearly 46% of prison inmates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;/&gt; The long-lasting effects of criminal conviction and imprisonment (convicted felons are barred from many jobs), results in the disenfranchisement of many African-Americans - time spent in prison is time spent away from education and on-the-job training. As a result, many African-Americans end up unskilled and with criminal convictions and felony records.

Some scholars argue that the disproportionate imprisonment of African-Americans in the U.S. actually countermands the achievements of the civil rights movement. The criminal justice system in the U.S. is arguably a massive machine that results in the production of racial inequality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;/&gt;  In fact, the inequality in the prison system is unmatched by that in other elements of society, as the following ratios indicate:
* ratio of African-American unemployment to European-American unemployment - 2 to 1
* ratio of African-Americans born to unwed mothers compared to European-American children born to unwed mothers - 3 to 1
* ratio of African-American infants who die compared to European-American infants who die - 2 to 1
* ratio of African-American to European-American wealth - 1 to 5
* ratio of African-American incarceration rate to European-American incarceration rate - 8 to 1

Another result of the disproportionate imprisonment of African-Americans in the U.S. is that imprisoned African-Americans are not included in calculations of unemployment rates. African-American are substantially more likely to be unemployed than European-American, but most statistics do not include prison populations.  

Another illustration of the disparity in punishment in the US based on race is tied to the death penalty.  Only 10% of individuals in the US sentenced to death are ever actually executed, but which ones are executed is intimately tied to race.  Individuals convicted of killing a European-American are five times more likely to be executed than individuals who killed a racial or ethnic minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs2007&quot;&gt;Jacobs, David; Qian, Zhenchao; Carmichael, Jason T. and Kent, Stephanie L. 2007. Who Survives on Death Row? An Individual and Contextual Analysis. American Sociological Review. 72:4, 610-632.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the criminal justice system in the US values white victims above minority victims.

All of these elements combined lead to the conclusion that one of the most racially disparate elements of U.S. society is the criminal justice system.

===Homicide===
The chart below tracks homicide rates in the U.S. for the past 100 years.  There has been an increase over time, though it is not clear whether that increase represents an actual increase in homicides or an increase in confounding factors, such as: stricter law enforcement, an increased willingness to report crimes, or changes in the definition of homicide itself.

[[Image:Homicide rates1900-2001.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Homicide rates in the US, 1900-2001.]]

The U.S. does not have the highest homicide rates in the world, but the rates in the U.S. are still relatively high compared to other countries (see chart).

[[Image:International homicide rates 2002.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Comparison of selected countries' homicide rates, 2002.]]

Homicide rates also vary the age of the victim, as shown in the chart below.  Note the similarity in homicide rates between the 14-17 age group and 18-24 age group.

[[Image:Homicide rates by age 1970-2003.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Homicide rates by age group, 1970-2002.]]

===High Crime Neighborhoods===
Traditionally people have thought of crime being the result of negative characteristics of a neighborhood (e.g., low incomes, high residential turnover rates, etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hipp2010&quot;/&gt;  However, there is some evidence to suggest that crime and the negative characteristics that were believed to cause high crime reinforce each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hipp2010&quot;&gt;Hipp, John R. 2010. “A Dynamic View of Neighborhoods: The Reciprocal Relationship between Crime and Neighborhood Structural Characteristics.” Social Problems 57:205-230.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research finds that higher crime rates actually leads to more concentrated poverty, declining retail presence, and more residential turnover.  This findings suggests that it is crime that drives away businesses and residents who have more money to safer areas, which then concentrates poverty and crime in that area.

==Social Control==
'''Social control''' refers to the various means used by a society to bring its  members back into line with cultural norms. There are two general types of social control:
*''formal social control'' refers to components of society that are designed for the resocialization of individuals who break formal rules; examples would include prisons and mental health institutions
*''informal social control'' refers to elements of society that are designed to reinforce informal cultural norms; examples might include parental reminders to children not to pick their nose.

Some researchers have outlined some of the motivations underlying the formal social control system.  These motivations include:
*''retribution'' - some argue that people should pay for the crime they committed
*''deterrence'' - some argue that punishments, e.g., prison time, will prevent people from committing future crimes
*''rehabilitation'' - some argue that formal social controls should work to rehabilitate criminals, eventually turning them into productive members of society
*''societal protection'' - finally, some argue that the motivation for formal social controls is nothing more than removing the deviant members of society from the non-deviant members

==Current Research==
===Video Games and Deviance===
Another area of current research that is of great interest to many people is the alleged effects of violent video games on behavior. Karen Sternheimer&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternheimer2007&quot;&gt;Sternheimer, Karen. 2007. &quot;Do video games kill?.&quot; Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:13-17.&lt;/ref&gt; explains that a lot of the concern around video games is illustrative of the social construction of deviance.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Goode and Nachman Ben-Yehuda. Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance (Blackwell, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Sternheimer, &quot;Politicians and other moral crusaders frequently create &quot;folk devils,&quot; individuals or groups defined as evil and immoral.  Folk devils allow us to channel our blame and fear, offering a clear course of action to remedy what many believe to be a growing problem.  Video games, those who play them, and those who create them have become contemporary folk devils because they seem to pose a threat to children.&quot; (p. 13)  The assumption is that playing violent video games will lead children to act out violently.  However, there is a growing body of literature that is either inconclusive on this issue or that contradicts this assumption: it does not appear as though playing violent video games results in violent behavior.

The reason why the assumption that playing violent video games is not accurate is because it decontextualizes violence.  Those who claim violent video games lead to violence fail to realize that violence is context dependent and most players of video games are fully aware of this.  Individuals who play video games recognize that violence in the context of the game is okay and that it is not okay to be violent outside of that context.  Additionally, many of the studies that have claimed to have found a connection between playing video games and violent behavior have failed to control for other influences on violent individuals, influences that are more likely to translate into violent behavior: neighborhood violence and instability, family violence, and even mental illness.  Seldom is a connection made between adult shooting sprees in the workplace (which are far more common than school shooting sprees)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternheimer2007&quot;/&gt; and video games. Instead, people look toward contextual influences like those described above (i.e., job loss, family problems, etc.).  In other words, violent video games are the folk devils for violent behavior in children, but not for adults.

Finally, the video game explanation is also illustrative of social-conflict and racial discrimination.  Seldom is the explanation of a black violent offender's behavior playing violent video games.  The assumption is that black culture encourages violence; as a result, violent behavior by young black men is not &quot;shocking,&quot; so it does not require a folk devil to explain it.  This is, of course, discriminatory.  In contrast, it is generally white, middle-class violent offenders whose behavior is explained by alleging a video game connection.  The fact that these violent offenders are white and middle class threatens the &quot;innocence and safety of suburban America,&quot; (p. 17)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternheimer2007&quot;/&gt; which means it requires a folk devil culprit, absolving white, middle-class America of the blame.

===Tattoos===
One area of current research into deviance that highlights the socially constructed nature of norms is tattoos. In 2003 a survey found that 15% of the U.S. adult population had at least one tattoo; that number jumps to 28% for adults under 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang2007&quot;&gt;Kang, Miliann, and Katherine Jones. 2007. “Why Do People Get Tattoos?.” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:42-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, tattoos are a very complicated illustration of the intricacies of deviance.  Many of the individuals getting tattoos do not fit the stereotypes of individuals who get tattoos (e.g., soldiers, sailors, bikers, etc.); many of those tattooing their bodies are high-achieving students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang2007&quot;/&gt; Additionally, tattooing is on the rise among women - 15% of women have tattoos while 16% of men do. Intriguingly, men and women get tattoos for different reasons.  For men it is to reinforce their masculinity and for women it is to enhance their femininity.  This differences illustrates another way in which gender is an action.

Another interesting aspect of tattoos is their changing meanings.  While it is probably not the case that the meaning (think symbolic interactionism) of tattoos to those who get them is changing (tattoos have traditionally been used to express one's self or commemorate events), how tattoos are viewed is changing.  In the early 1900s tattoos were so stigmatized that they could literally result in prosecution and served as evidence of ill intent and disrepute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang2007&quot;/&gt;  Such extreme stigmatization is no longer the cause, probably because 88% of Americans know someone with a tattoo.  As a result, tattoos are decreasingly seen as deviant.  But tattoos also illustrate that deviance is not determined by the action but by those perceiving the action.  While a tattoo may mean one thing to the person with the tattoo, it is still the case that others interpret the tattoo in a multitude of ways, and those don't always align with the intended meanings.  Still today, tattoos are often equated with: drug use, troublemakers, and gang affiliation. This is probably why many people who get tattoos get them in locations that can easily be covered in regular business attire - that way they can still pass when not in the company of those who are more understanding of their tattoos.  Tattoos, then, illustrate the sociological understanding of deviance quite well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Race and Ethnicity==
A '''race''' is a human population that is believed to be distinct in some way from other humans based on real or imagined ''physical'' differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, Luca; Menozzi, Paolo; and Piazza, Alberto. 1996. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton University Press. Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Racial classifications are rooted in the idea of biological classification of humans according to morphological features such as skin color or facial characteristics. An individual is usually externally classified (meaning someone else makes the classification) into a racial group rather than the individual choosing where they belong as part of their identity. Conceptions of race, as well as specific racial groupings, are often [[w:controversial issue|controversial]] due to their impact on [[w:social identity|social identity]] and how those identities influence someone's position in social hierarchies (see [[w:identity politics|identity politics]]). 

Ethnicity, while related to race, refers not to physical characteristics but social traits that are shared by a human population.  Some of the social traits often used for ethnic classification include:
*nationality
*tribe
*religious faith
*shared language
*shared culture
*shared traditions
Unlike race, ethnicity is not usually externally assigned by other individuals. The term ethnicity focuses more upon a group's connection to a perceived shared past and culture.

==The Changing Definitions of Race==
The division of humanity into distinct ''races'' can be traced as far back as the Ancient Egyptian sacred text the [[w:Book of Gates|Book of Gates]], which identified four races according to the Egyptians. This early treatment merged racial and ethnic differences, combining skin-color with tribal and national identities. Ancient Greek and Roman authors also attempted to explain and categorize visible biological differences between peoples known to them. [[w:Medieval|Medieval]] models of race mixed Classical ideas with the notion that humanity as a whole was descended from Shem, Ham and Japheth, the three [[w:sons of Noah|sons of Noah]], producing distinct [[w:Semitic|Semitic]], (Asian), [[w:Hamitic|Hamitic]] (African), and [[w:Japhetic|Japhetic]] (European) peoples. The first scientific attempts to categorize race date from the 17th century; these early attempts developed along with European imperialism and colonisation around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt;

In the 19th century a number of natural scientists wrote on race: [[w:Georges Cuvier|Georges Cuvier]], [[w:James Cowles Pritchard|James Cowles Pritchard]], [[w:Louis Agassiz|Louis Agassiz]], [[w:Charles Pickering NMI|Charles Pickering]], and [[w:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]].  These scientists made three claims about race: 
#races are objective, naturally occurring divisions of humanity
#there is a strong relationship between biological races and other human phenomena (such as social behavior and culture, and by extension the relative material success of cultures)
#race is therefore a valid scientific category that can be used to explain and predict individual and group behavior  
Races were distinguished by [[w:human skin color|skin color]], facial type, cranial profile and size, and texture and color of hair. Races were almost universally considered to reflect group differences in moral character and intelligence.

These early understandings of race were usually both [[w:essentialism|essentialist]] and [[w:taxonomic|taxonomic]]; essentialism refers to unchanging and inherent characteristics of individuals and taxonomic refers to classificatory (also usually hierarchical) in nature.  The advent of [[w:Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] models of [[w:evolution|evolution]] and [[w:Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[w:genetics|genetics]], however, called into question the scientific validity of both characteristics and required a radical reconsideration of race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt; 

The table below illustrates both how early definitions included essentialist and taxonomic elements and how definitions have changed over time.

|}

Because racial differences continue to be important issues in social and political life, racial classifications continue.  The United States government has attempted its own definitions of race and ethnicity (see for example [[w:Race (U.S. Census)|U.S. Census]]) for such classifications and comparisons.

==Social Construct or Biological Lineage?==
===Social Construction===
Debates continue in and among academic disciplines as to how race should be understood. Some sociologists and biologists believe race is a [[w:social construction|social construct]], meaning it does not have a basis in the natural world but is simply an artificial distinction created by humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt;  As a result of this understanding, some researchers have turned from conceptualizing and analyzing human variation by race to doing so in terms of [[w:population genetics|populations]], dismissing racial classifications altogether. In the face of the increasing rejection of race as a valid classification scheme, many social scientists have replaced the word ''race'' with the word ''[[w:Ethnic group|ethnicity]]'' to refer to self-identifying groups based on  shared religion, nationality, or culture.

The understanding of race as a social construct is well-illustrated by examining race issues in two countries, the U.S. and Brazil.

====Constructing Race in the U.S.====
Since the early days of the United States, Native Americans, African-Americans and European-Americans were classified as belonging to different races.  But the criteria for membership in these races were radically different.  For Africans, the government considered anyone with African appearance to be purely African.  Native Americans, on the other hand, were classified based on a certain percentage of ''Indian blood''.  Finally, European-Americans had to have purely white ancestry.  The differing criteria for assigning  membership to particular races had relatively little to do with biology; it had far more to do with maintaining a group's defined roles and position.  

[[Image:Racial makeup of the us 2007.png|center|thumb|600px]]

Some researchers and historians have proposed that the intent of the differing criteria for racial designations was to concentrate power, wealth, privilege, and land in the hands of European-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fields1990&quot;&gt;Fields, Barbara Jean. 1990. Slavery, Race, and Ideology in the United States of America. New Left Review 181:95-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sider1993&quot;&gt;Sider, Gerald. 1993. Lumbee Indian Histories: Race, Ethnicity, and Indian Identity in the Southern United States.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the offspring of an African slave and European master or mistress would be considered an African.  Significant in terms of the economics of slavery, the mixed-race child of a slave mother also would be a slave, adding to the wealth of the slaveowner.  

Contrast the African criteria with that of Native Americans; a person of Native American and African parentage automatically was classified as African.   But the offspring of only a few generations of Native Americans and Europeans were not considered Indian at all - at least not in a legal sense.  Native Americans had treaty rights to land, but individuals with only one Indian great-grandparent were no longer classified as Native American, disenfranchising them from their claims to Native American lands.  Of course, the same individuals who could be denied legal claim to Native American lands because they were ''too White'', were still Native American enough to be considered ''half-breeds and were stigmatized as a result.  

In an economy benefitting from slave labor, it was useful to have as many African slaves as possible.  Conversely, in a nation bent on westward expansion, it was advantageous to diminish the numbers of those who could claim title to Indian lands by classifying them out of existence.  Both schemes benefitted the third group, the ''racially pure'' whites.  The point being, of course, that the classifications of race in the early U.S. were socially constructed in a fashion that benefitted one ''race'' over the others.

The earliest blacks in the U.S. were brought from Africa as [[w:slaves|slaves]] primarily to help in agricultural in the southern U.S.  While migration since then has substantially altered the distribution of African Americans in the U.S., African Americans remain concentrated in the southern U.S., as depicted in the map below.

[[File:Percent black in U.S. by census district - 2000.png|center|600px]]

Native Americans in the U.S. are concentrated on [[w:Indian reservation|reservations]], as depicted in the map below:

[[File:Percent native american in the U.S. by census district 2000.png|center|thumb|600px]]

====Constructing Race in Brazil====
[[File:Race in brazil 2006.png|thumb|400px|right]]
The [[w:IBGE|Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] classifies the Brazilian population in five categories: white, black, [[w:pardo|pardo]] or ([[w:Brown people|brown]]), [[w:Asian people|yellow]], and [[w:Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous]], based on skin color as given by the individual being interviewed in the census.

*[[w:White Brazilian|White]] (49.4% of the population):&lt;ref name=&quot;IBGE2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2006/indic_sociais2006.pdf Sintese_2006_semlinks.indd&lt;/ref&gt; usually a Brazilian of full or predominant European ancestry or other ancestry (such as [[w:German Brazilian|German Brazilian]]) who considers himself or herself to be White.
*[[w:Pardo|Pardo]] or [[w:Brown people|Brown]] (42.3%):&lt;ref name=&quot;IBGE2006&quot;/&gt; usually a Multiracial Brazilian of mixed-race features who considers himself or herself to be &quot;''Pardo''&quot;. In practice, most of the &quot;''Pardo''&quot; people are of mixed European and African (mulatos), but this category also includes people of mixed European and Amerindian (caboclos) and Amerindian and African (cafusos) genetic ancestry&lt;ref&gt;http://prado38.sites.uol.com.br/castrofaria3.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[w:Afro-Brazilian|Black]] (7.4%):&lt;ref name=&quot;IBGE2006&quot;/&gt; usually a dark-skinned Brazilian of full or predominant [[w:Black people|Black]] African ancestry who considers himself or herself to be Black.
*Yellow: (0.5%) usually a Brazilian of [[w:East Asia|East Asia]]n descent, mostly [[w:Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]].
*[[w:Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous]] (0.3%):&lt;ref name=&quot;Brazzil2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.brazzil.com/p119jan03.htm Brazil - Brasil - BRAZZIL - News from Brazil - The life and death of Orlando Villas Boas - Brazilian Indians, Ecology, Amazon- January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; usually a Brazilian of full or predominant Amerindian ancestry who considers himself or herself to be Amerindian.

Of particular interest to the discussion of race in this chapter is the fact that there is a racial classification that falls between &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot;: &quot;pardo&quot; or &quot;brown.&quot;  That Brazilians have more racial classifications than do people in the United States illustrates the socially constructed nature of race.  Additionally, racial classification in Brazil, because it is based on self-classification and there are no objective criteria for what it means to belong to one race or another, is inconsistent about 21% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telles2002&quot;&gt;Telles, Edward E. 2002. “Racial ambiguity among the Brazilian population..” Ethnic &amp; Racial Studies 25:415-441.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the mixing of the races, race is not inherited but determined purely by physical characteristics (i.e., a white father and black mother could have a &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black,&quot; or &quot;pardo&quot; child).  Additionally, because race is self-determined and there is discrimination based on race (white are favored),&lt;ref name=&quot;Telles2002&quot;/&gt; Brazilians have a tendency to &quot;self-lighten,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mangels2007&quot;&gt;Mangels, Laura, and Laura Neves. 2007. “Racial Classification in Brazil: Discrepancies between Observed and Self-Identified Race..” Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; or report their race as being lighter than an independent observer may suggest.  That people can &quot;self-lighten&quot; illustrates that race is not a fixed construct but rather that it is socially constructed.

===Biology and Genetics===
The social constructionist approach has not completely occluded other perspectives.  Some sociologists (and other researchers) still believe that race is a valid and useful measure when understood as [[w:fuzzy set|fuzzy sets]], [[w:Data clustering|clusters]], or [[w:Kinship and descent|extended families]].

Genetic data can be used to infer population structure and assign individuals to groups that often correspond with their self-identified geographical ancestry (e.g., African, Asian, etc.).  Recent research indicates that self-described race is a very good indicator of an individual's genetic profile, at least in the United States. Using 326 genetic markers, Tang ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang2005&quot;&gt;Tang, H.; Quertermous, T.; Rodriguez, B.; Kardia, S.L.; Zhu, X.; Brown, A.; Pankow, J.S.; Province, M.A.; Hunt, S.C.; Boerwinkle, E.; Schork, N.J.; Risch, N.J. 2005. Genetic structure, self-identified race/ethnicity, and confounding in case-control association studies. American Journal of Human Genetics. 76:268-75.&lt;/ref&gt; identified 4 genetic clusters among 3,636 individuals sampled from 15 locations in the United States, and were able to correctly assign individuals to groups that correspond with their self-described race (white, African American, East Asian, and Hispanic) for all but 5 individuals (an error rate of 0.14%). They concluded that ancient ancestry/geography, which correlates highly with self-described race and not current place of residence, is the major determinant of genetic structure in the US population.  The implications of such research are significant and can be seen in different health conditions prevalent among racial and ethnic groups (see extended discussion below).

In general, genetic variation within racial groups is greater than genetic variation between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt; However, the existence of genetic differences among races is well accepted. In general, genetic clusters exist that correspond tightly to the census definition of race and to self-identified ancestry. Certain genetic conditions are more common among certain races.  For example, approximately 1 in 29 individuals of Northern European descent are carriers of a mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, whereas only about 1 in 65 African Americans is a carrier ([http://www.acog.org/from_home/wellness/cf001.htm source]).  There is a subset of conditions for which individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at increased risk (see [[w:Ashkenazi#Genetics|here]]).  Based on this knowledge individuals can be offered genetic testing based on their race, which can determine whether they are at increased risk to have a child with one of these conditions. The association between race and genetics breaks down for groups, such as [[w:Hispanic|Hispanics]], that exhibit a pattern of geographical stratification of ancestry. 

There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. Proponents of using race in biomedical research argue that ignoring race will be detrimental to the health of minority groups. They argue that disease risk factors differ substantially between racial groups, that relying only on genotypical classes - differences in genes - ignores non-genetic racial factors that impact health (e.g., poverty rates) and that minorities would be poorly represented in clinical trials if race were ignored.  However, some fear that the use of racial labels in biomedical research runs the risk of unintentionally exacerbating health disparities, so they suggest alternatives to the use of racial taxonomies.

The primary impetus for considering race in biomedical research is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of [[w:disease|diseases]] by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors on the basis of more easily ascertained characteristics. Indeed, the first medication marketed for a specific racial group, [http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.nitromed.com/BiDil.shtml&amp;e=9888 BiDil] was recently approved by the U.S. FDA. A large study of African American males showed a 43% reduction in deaths and a 39% decrease in hospitalizations compared to a placebo. Interestingly, this drug would never have been approved if the researchers had not taken note of racial groups and realized that although the medication was not effective in previous clinical trials, it appeared to be effective for the small proportion of African-Americans males who were part of the study ([http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/23/health/main703873.shtml source]). Despite the controversy, it is clear that race is associated with differential disease susceptibility.  Examples of some of these differences are illustrated in the table below.

===Combining Approaches===
Perhaps the best way to understand race is to recognize that the socially constructed boundaries and biological/genetic elements overlap.  There are clearly biological differences between races, though they are small and, as noted above, there is greater variation within races than between races. But the actual criteria used for racial classifications are artificial and socially constructed, as was shown in the cases of the U.S. and Brazil.  

By recognizing the overlap between the two, we are presented with a better understanding of race.  However, distinctions between racial groups are declining due to intermarriage and have been for years. For instance, self-described African Americans tend to have a mix of West African and European ancestry. Shriver ''et al''. (2003)&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriver2003&quot;&gt;Shriver, M.D. ''et al.'' 2003. Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry, and admixture mapping. Human Genetics. 112:387-399.&lt;/ref&gt; found that on average African Americans have ~80% African ancestry. Likewise, many white Americans have mixed European and African ancestry; ~30% of whites have less than 90% European ancestry. If intermarrying of races and ethnicities continues, the biological and genetic distinctions will grow increasingly minute and undetectable.  If a completely heterogeneous population ultimately develops, any racial classifications in that population would be nothing more than social constructs.

Controversies surrounding the definition of ''race'' will likely continue for some time.  But there are important considerations that go beyond the definition of race.  Race and race-related issues continue to impact society. Racial discrimination in employment and housing still occurs (source). Because race remains a significant factor in social life, sociologists feel compelled to study its effects at multiple levels.

==Prejudice, Bias, and Discrimination==
'''Prejudice''' is, as the name implies, the ''pre-judging'' of something. Prejudice involves coming to a judgment on a subject before learning where the preponderance of evidence actually lies. Alternatively, prejudice can refer to the formation of a judgment without direct or actual experience. Prejudice generally refers to negative views of an individual or group of individuals, often based on [[w:social stereotypes|social stereotypes]]. At its most extreme, prejudicial attitudes advocate denying groups benefits and rights without warrant and based solely on the unfounded views of the individual.  It should be kept in mind that prejudice is a belief and may not translate into '''discrimination''', which is the actual mistreatment of a group or individual based upon some criteria or characteristic.  Although prejudice can lead to discrimination, the two are separate concepts.

Technically, prejudice should be differentiated from viewpoints accumulated through direct life experience. Such viewpoints or beliefs are not pre-judgments but post-judgments. If the assertion is made that no amount of experience ever entitles a person to a viewpoint then this precipitates a logical absurdity since anyone who opposes strongly-held views must, by their own definition, also be prejudiced, invalidating their own proposition on the grounds of... ''prejudice''. Post-judgments or beliefs and viewpoints derived from experience that maintain unfair or stereotypical perspectives on a group of people is more accurately referred to as '''bias'''. Prejudice can be taught, socialized, or conveyed through other means, like mass media. Bias can develop through pronounced negative interactions with the stereotyped groups.  

Both bias and prejudice are generally viewed as negative.  However, some sociologists have argued that prejudices and biases can be seen as necessary human adaptations facilitating survival.  In fact, there is evidence to suggest that humans have an innate or basic preference for people who are like them, specifically when it comes to race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu2009&quot;&gt;Xu, Xiaojing, Xiangyu Zuo, Xiaoying Wang, and Shihui Han. 2009. “Do You Feel My Pain? Racial Group Membership Modulates Empathic Neural Responses.” J. Neurosci. 29:8525-8529.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans express more empathy when members of their own racial group experience pain compared to when individuals of other racial groups experience pain.  This suggests prejudice and biases may have a biological component.  Since humans do not always have sufficient time to form personal views on every other group of people, particularly people in opposition to one's own group(s), prejudices and biases may facilitate interactions (although negatively). Prejudice may also be detrimental to the individual personally by pre-judging a potential ally (e.g. refusing to patronize the only doctor in a town because he or she is black). Despite having innate preferences towards individuals who look like we do, there is substantial evidence that suggests most prejudicial attitudes and biases are learned and can be unlearned.

==Racism==
'''Racism''' can refer to any or all of the following beliefs and behaviors:
*race is the primary determinant of human capacities (prejudice or bias)
*a certain race is inherently superior or inferior to others (prejudice or bias)
*individuals should be treated differently according to their racial classification (prejudice or bias)
*the actual treating of individuals differently based on their racial classification (discrimination)

[[Image:ColoredDrinking.jpg|thumb|250px|An African-American drinks out of a water cooler designated for use by ''colored'' patrons in 1939 at a streetcar terminal in Oklahoma City.]]

Racism is recognised by many as an affront to basic human dignity and a violation of [[w:human rights|human rights]]. Racism is opposed by almost all mainstream voices in the United States. A number of international treaties have sought to end racism. The United Nations uses a definition of ''racist discrimination'' laid out in the ''International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination'' and adopted in 1965:

:...any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

===Expressions of Racism===
Racism may be expressed individually and consciously, through explicit thoughts, feelings, or acts, or socially and unconsciously, through institutions that promote inequalities among ''races''. 

====Individual-Level Racism====
Individual-level racism is prejudice, bias, or discrimination displayed in an interaction between two or more people. Examples of individual-level racism could include:
*a person believing people of other races/ethnicities are intellectually inferior and that the inferiority is a characteristic of the race
*a person holding the belief that all young African males are dangerous
*an employer firing someone because of his/her race

Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite young (between the ages of 5 and 11) and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKown2009&quot;&gt;McKown, Clark, and Michael J. Strambler. 2009. “Developmental Antecedents and Social and Academic Consequences of Stereotype-Consciousness in Middle Childhood.” Child Development 80:1643-1659.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKown2009&quot;/&gt;  Another illustration of individual-level racism in society is the resistance of Americans to classify mixed-race individuals as white if they have even &quot;one-drop&quot; of black ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ho2011&quot;&gt;Ho, A. K., Sidanius, J., Levin, D. T. &amp; Banaji, M. R. (2011). Evidence for Hypodescent and Racial Hierarchy in the Categorization and Perception of Biracial Individuals. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100, 492-506.&lt;/ref&gt;  While most Americans may believe the &quot;[[w:One-drop rule|one-drop rule]]&quot; is no longer relevant in society today, recent research suggests that it persists in racial classifications, even if they are informal.

====Structural Racism====
''Structural'' racism refers to inequalities built into an organization or system.  An example of structural racism can be seen in recent research on workplace discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertrand2004&quot;&gt;Bertrand, Marianne and Mullainathan, Sendhil. “Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination.” American Economic Review, September 2004, Vol. 94, No. 4, pp. 991-1,013.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is widespread discrimination against job applicants whose names were merely perceived as &quot;sounding black.&quot; These applicants were 50% less likely than candidates perceived as having &quot;white-sounding names&quot; to receive callbacks for interviews, no matter their level of previous experience. The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in the country's long history of discrimination.  This is an example of structural racism as it shows a widespread established belief system that treats people differently based upon their race.  Additional examples of structural racism include [[w:apartheid|apartheid]] in South Africa, the system of [[w:Jim Crow|Jim Crow]] laws in the U.S., and the inequitable lending practices of banks (i.e.,  [[w:redlining|redlining]]).  The figure below illustrates structural racism by illustrating how blacks and Hispanics, even when they have the same income as whites, are less likely to be approved for home mortgages (as a result of practices like redlining).

[[File:Race-ethnicity and mortgages.png|center|thumb|600px]]

Another example of structural racism is the discrimination faced by Asian Americans in attaining leadership positions in corporations.  While Asian Americans are over-represented in professional occupations in the US, they are under-represented among corporate elite.  Approximately 5% of the US population is Asian American, but just .3% of of corporate officers are Asian American.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sy2010&quot;&gt;Sy, Thomas et al. 2010. “Leadership Perceptions as a Function of Race–occupation Fit: The Case of Asian Americans.” Journal of Applied Psychology 95(5):902–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The under-representation of Asian Americans is particularly surprising considering they are perceived to be highly capable, particularly in technical occupations.  But they are also perceived to be less capable leaders due to a perception that they lack charisma.  The result is structural racism: corporate advancement is structured such that Asian Americans are over-looked for leadership positions.

====Cultural Racism====
''Cultural'' racial discrimination, a variation of structural racism, occurs when the assumption of inferiority of one or more races is built into the culture of a society. In this perspective, racism is an expression of culture and is also passed on through the transmission of culture (i.e., socialization).  An interesting twist on this type of prejudice can be seen in how high achieving secondary school students are treated.  African American and Native American students with high GPAs are rejected by their peers while Asian American and white students with high GPAs experience greater social acceptance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuller-Rowell2010&quot;&gt;Fuller-Rowell, Thomas E., and Stacey N. Doan. 2010. “The Social Costs of Academic Success Across Ethnic Groups.” Child Development 81:1696-1713.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that different racial and ethnic groups are rewarded for academic achievement while others are punished, potentially leading to members of those groups to pursue academic success while others are discouraged from doing so.

====Historical Racism====
''Historical economic or social disparity'' is a form of inequality caused by past racism, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and other kinds of preparation in the parents' generation, and, through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.  This perspective argues that African-Americans, in particular, in the U.S. have had their opportunities in life adversely affected due to the mistreatment of their ancestors (see [[w:slavery|slavery]]).  Disparities in wealth, [[w:net worth|net worth]] and education lend credence to this idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson1978&quot;&gt;Wilson, William Julius. 1978. The Declining Significance of Race.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson1990&quot;&gt;Wilson, William Julius. 1990. The Truly Disadvantaged.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure below illustrates how historical racism has resulted in lower odds of inter-generational transmission of wealth, which, in turn, reduces net worth for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S.

[[File:Net worth by race ethnicity - 2002.png|center|right|600px]]

One response to racial disparity in the U.S. has been ''[[w:Affirmative action|Affirmative Action]]''. Affirmative Action is the practice of favoring or benefiting members of a particular race in areas such as college admissions and workplace advancement, in an attempt to create atmospheres of racial [[w:diversity|diversity]] and racial equality. Though lauded by many as a boon to society, giving the less privileged a chance at success and working to overcome historical social disparity, the practice is condemned as racially discriminatory by others.

====Racial Profiling====
Another type of racism is [[w:Racial profiling|racial profiling]]. Racial profiling involves the singling out of individuals based upon their race for differential treatment, usually harsher treatment. Two examples of racial profiling in the United States are often discussed. The disparate treatment of minorities by law enforcement officials is a common example of racial profiling. Another example is the disparate treatment of young, male Arabs in airports who are more likely to be subjected to extensive screening. Many critics of racial profiling claim that it is an unconstitutional practice because it amounts to questioning individuals on the basis of what crimes they might commit or could possibly commit, instead of what crimes they have actually committed.

====Color-Blind Racism====
In the US, the avoidance of racial language by European-Americans has been used to suggest that racism is no longer an issue. However, the continued prevalence of institutional racism has led some scholars like Bonilla-Silva to argue a &quot;new racism&quot; exists, that has arisen during the post-Civil Rights era. Bonilla-Silva suggests that a &quot;color-blind racism&quot; ideology supports racism while avoiding any reference to race.

====Genocide====
While not exclusively the result of racial or ethnic tension, [[w:genocide|genocide]], the attempt to completely destroy a group of people based on a characteristic they share by another group of people who do not share that characteristic, is often the result of racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagan2008&quot;&gt;Hagan, John, and Wenona Rymond-Richmond. 2008. “The Collective Dynamics of Racial Dehumanization and Genocidal Victimization in Darfur.” American Sociological Review 73:875-902.&lt;/ref&gt;  One technique that is often used by individuals engaged in genocide and even in war is [[w:racial epithet|racial epithets]] that [[w:dehumanize|dehumanize]] the enemy, making it easier to kill them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagan2008&quot;/&gt;

==Minorities==
Racism is usually directed against a '''minority''' population, but may also be directed against a '''majority''' population.  The definition of a minority group can vary, depending on specific context, but generally refers to either a sub-group that does not form either a majority or a plurality of the total population, or a group that, while not necessarily a numerical minority, is disadvantaged or otherwise has less power (whether political or economic) than a dominant group.  A majority is that segment of the population that outnumbers all others combined or one that is dominant. 

The issue of establishing minority groups, and determining the extent of privileges they might derive from their status, is controversial. There are some who argue that minorities are owed special recognition and rights, while others feel that minorities are unjustified in demanding special rights, as this amounts to preferential discrimination and could hamper the ability of the minority to integrate itself into mainstream society (i.e. they may have difficulty finding work if they do not speak the predominant language for their geographic area).

The assimilation of minority groups into majority groups can be seen as a form of racism.  In this process, the minority group sheds its distinctive traits and is absorbed into the dominant group.  This presumes a loss of all characteristics which make the newcomers different. Assimilation can be voluntary or forced.  Voluntary assimilation is usually the case with immigrants, who often adopt the dominant culture established earlier.  Reasons that have been postulated for voluntary assimilation include: 
#it is seen as an avenue to upward social mobility
#it is a way to escape prejudice and discrimination

Socially pressured to adapt, the immigrant is generally the one who takes the steps to integrate into the new environment. Learning the language of the country or region, making new friends, new contacts, finding a job or going to school. The adaptation is made more difficult when the immigrant does not speak the language of his or her new home. 

Assimilation can have negative implications for national minorities or aboriginal cultures, in that after assimilation the distinctive features of the original culture will be minimized and may disappear altogether. This is especially true in situations where the institutions of the dominant culture initiate programs to assimilate or integrate minority cultures.  Many [[w:indigenous people|indigenous peoples]], such as [[w:First Nations|First Nations]] of Canada, Native Americans of the US, [[w:Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aborigines]], and [[w:Australian Aborigine|Australian Aborigines]] have mostly lost their traditional culture (most evidently language) and replaced it with the dominant new culture.

An example of a minority population discriminating against a majority population is seen in the racial [[w:apartheid|apartheid]] that existed until just recently in South Africa.  South Africans of European descent (the minority) discriminated against the majority African population (the majority). Additional examples of minorities discriminating against majorities include two instances of colonial rule:
*the treatment of the [[w:Vietnam|Vietnamese]] people by the [[w:France|French]]
*the treatment of [[w:India|Indians]] by the [[w:United Kingdom|the British]]

[[w:Racial discrimination|Racial discrimination]] is and has been official government policy in many countries.  In the 1970s, [[w:Uganda|Uganda]] expelled tens of thousands of ethnic [[w:India|Indians]].  Until 2003, [[w:Malaysia|Malaysia]] enforced discriminatory policies limiting access to university education for ethnic Chinese and [[w:Indian|Indian]] students who are citizens by birth of Malaysia. Today, many other policies explicitly favoring [[w:bumiputra|bumiputras]] (Malays) remain in force. Russia launched anti-Semitic [[w:pogroms|pogroms]] against Jews in 1905 and after. During the 1930s and 1940s, attempts were made to prevent Jews from immigrating to the Middle East. Following the creation of [[w:Israel|Israel]], land-ownership in many Israeli towns was limited to [[w:Jew|Jews]], and many [[w:Muslim|Muslim]] countries expelled Jewish residents, and continue to refuse entry to Jews.

==Racial Stratification==
While race itself is a social construction, race continues to play a prominent role in societies around the world.  Race is often the basis for different types of stratification.  Following are some of the ways society is stratified by race.

===Race and Pollution===
Pollution and polluting facilities are not evenly distributed in the U.S.  Communities made up predominantly of racial minorities are significantly more likely to be polluted and to house factories and business that pollute extensively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellow2007&quot;&gt;Pellow, David Naguib, and Robert J. Brulle. 2007. “poisoning the planet: the struggle for environmental justice..” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; While it might seem that this is inadvertent and not intentionally racist, the evidence suggest otherwise: these communities are systematically targeted as locations for situating polluting businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellow2007&quot;/&gt;

===Interracial Marriage===
Not until 1967 were laws outlawing interracial marriage abolished in the United States.  Prior to that time, an individual from one race who married an individual from another could be jailed and fined.  These laws were referred to as [[w:miscegenation|miscegenation]] laws (miscegenation means &quot;mixing races&quot;).  This was the experience of Mildred and Richard Loving, who married in 1958 in Washington D.C., a district in the US that no longer had a law against interracial marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;&gt;Martin, Douglas. 2008. “Mildred Loving, Who Battled Ban on Mixed-Race Marriage, Dies at 68.” The New York Times, May 6 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06loving.html (Accessed July 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Mildred was black; Richard was white. When they moved to Virginia shortly after their wedding, law enforcement decided to prosecute them, breaking into their home in the middle of the night and carrying them off to jail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;/&gt;  Both Mildred and Richard were from Virginia, where their extended family still lived.  The judge who heard their case, Leon M. Bazile, told the Lovings during their trial for miscegenation that, 'if God had meant for whites and blacks to mix, he would have not placed them on different continents.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;/&gt; He also seemed to take pride in telling the Lovings, &quot;as long as you live you will be known as a felon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;/&gt;  The Lovings eventually contacted the [[w:American Civil Liberties Union|American Civil Liberties Union]], who took their case to the Supreme Court in 1967, resulting in [[w:Loving v. Virginia|Loving v. Virginia]], which abolished miscegenation laws in the U.S.  Even so, as the diagram to the right indicates, attitudes toward interracial marriage did not immediately improve.  Still as late as 2002, close to 10% of people in the U.S. favored a law prohibiting interracial marriage.

[[Image:Public opinion of interracial marriage in the United States.png|thumb|center|600px]]

==A Research Example==
Devah Pager and Lincoln Quillian &lt;ref name=&quot;Pager2005&quot;&gt;Pager, Devah and Quillian, Lincoln. 2005. Walking the Talk? What Employers Say Versus What They Do. American Sociological Review. 70(3):355-380.&lt;/ref&gt; compared employers' responses on questions involving race-related hiring practices to their actual hiring practices by sending matched pairs of young men to apply for jobs, either both of European descent or both of African descent, but one of the men had a criminal record. Pager and Quillian found that employers claimed they would be much more willing to hire an ex-offender than they were. Additionally, while the survey results showed no difference in hiring preferences between African-Americans and European-Americans, employers were more than three times as likely to call job applicants with a European lineage back in comparison to Americans with an African lineage. In short, Pager and Quillian found that employers, in their survey responses, were more open to the idea of hiring both African-Americans and ex-offenders than they were to the actual practice.

==Notes==
*The word ''race'' was introduced to English from the French in the late 16th century.
*It is worth noting that many historical scientists, philosophers, and statesmen appear ''racist'' by late-20th century standards. Contextualizing these people, their views and opinions in the cultural milieu of their day should allow the astute reader to avoid the pitfall of judging historic figures from present moral standards (i.e., whiggish historicism).

**This article discusses the continuing legacy of racial discrimination in South Africa.  The school system under apartheid favored whites, but even since the end of apartheid, the school system continues to favor whites and the few blacks who make it into the formerly white-only schools.  As a result, blacks in South Africa who attend the formerly all-black schools remain poorly educated and unable to find good work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reusable Learning Objects, NCLB and Special Education ==
What do [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCLB NCLB]] (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001) and Reusable [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Objects:Page2 Learning Objects]], have to do with each other?  The latter could help satisfy the former.  NCLB is an aggressive plan by the federal government to improve student achievement and hold schools accountable if students do not.  Schools must make AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress) with all students being proficient by 2013-2014. If a a school that is receiving Title 1 funding fails to make AYP for two consecutive years, they are required to offer school choice, take corrective action, or provide supplemental education srvices to their students. To do this,  the achievement levels of specific subgroups of students must be raised, with students in special education being one of those subgroups.

Special education means different things to different people.  It can be as simple as a special education teacher advising a regular classroom teacher as to ways lessons can be adapted to make them more accessible for [[http://www.sedl.org/change/issues/issues43.html included]] special education students, all the way to residential schools that cater to students with a particular [[http://www.bridges4kids.org/Disabilities/MIlabels.html disability]].  Despite the location, special education means helping students with special needs achieve the goals and objectives as dictated by their IEP’s (Individualized Education Program).

=== The Individualized Education Program ===
[[http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html IEP]] stands for Individualized Education Program and is the plan agreed upon by the parents/guardians and educators for every child that is designated as needing special education. They are reviewed yearly and altered if needed.

=== Examples of IEP goals and objectives: ===
The student will develop/increase their math application skills by identifying/using graphs and tables to obtain information 80% of the time on an informal test.

The student will develop/increase vocabulary and word recognition skills by recognizing/recalling common sight words, critical sight words: colors, numbers, months, days of the week, Dolch list, and survival words 8 out of 10 tries.

=== Customizing for the IEP Using Reusable Learning Objects ===
In a nutshell, special education is customizing lessons to meet each students’ needs. Reusable learning objects will allow teachers to do just that. Students in special education need to be exposed to the same information as their regular education peers, but not necessarily in the same format. Since students with the same disability can function at different levels, it is very difficult to find a textbook to accommodate a given group of students. Another problem with textbooks is that they are usually written at grade level. Students with disabilities often do not read at grade level. They need other ways to access the information.

A well constructed learning object deals with a single idea or chunk of content. A teacher can string these objects together to create or support a lesson. Searching through learning object depositories, teachers would be able to review objects and find ones that met the needs of their students. Because RLO's are digital, they are limited only by the creativity of the author. The issue of reading level could perhaps be avoided by finding an object that taught through animation. Sound can also be incorporated into learning objects to assist with the reading level issue. As well, or for those student whose learning modality is more aural than visual. They may also need to have the content presented differently, or in a number of ways before they get the meaning. This can be easily accomplished with this digital medium.

In some cases, templates are available. Using a template for a learning object, even teachers with minimal experience can provide numerous opportunities for learning. Once a student is familiar with the interactivity of the particular learning object, the no longer have to worry about what to do and can focus on learning the content. For many students in special education, reading and following directions can be a problem. If a student is familiar with a particular format they can work on their own without having to wait for instructions.

Memory is also an issue for many students in special education. Some need a great deal more exposure to the content than their peers. If the teacher is also the author of the learning object he/she would be able to easily personalize these objects to make them more meaningful to the student. More importantly, they could be tailored to address the specific objectives from that student's IEP. Building quizzes and tests into the objects would also allow the student and the teacher to monitor the student's progress.

More and more, teachers are expected to individualize instruction. Reusable learning objects can make this much easier. Textbooks are expensive and districts aren't likely to purchase individual ones for students as teachers might like. Specialized packets aren't any more practical in the long run. The costs of paper and the purchasing and maintaining of copiers is a constant packets is extrememly time-consuming for teachers. Storing all these accumulated materials also gets to be a problem over time. Eventually, closets and storerooms become filled with leftover materials that either did not work out as expected or were extra because many materials have to be ordered in specified quantities.

Initially, creating and/or retrieving learning objects may be time-consuming, but, once assembled, the teacher need just review and edit them for use with another student and/or class. No more flipping through workbooks and hours in front of a copier or rummaging through dusty closets. With a well-organized favorites folder and a few clicks of a mouse, teachers will be able to construct customized lessons and for students that genuinely reflect the goals and objectives on their IEP's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How is Ido different from Esperanto? ==

=== Vocabulary ===

Ido is a modified version of Esperanto with a number of changes designed to make it easier to learn and easier to type.

The first noticable difference between the two languages is that Esperanto has the diacritical marks ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŭ, ĉ, and ŝ. These are used in order to adhere to the one letter = one sound rule, but many thought them to be a needless barrier in promoting the language. Ido did away with letters with diacritical marks and instead replaced:
* ĝ with j (pronounced as in French '''''j'''e'' and as the 'zh' sound as the 's' in 'pleasure')
* ĥ with h (the ĥ in Esperanto is pronounced as in Arabic)
* ĵ with j (same sound as above)
* ŭ with u
* ĉ with ch
* ŝ with sh.
* j with y

=== Internationality ===

The creators of Ido felt that much of Esperanto was either not internationally recognizable, or unnecessarily deformed. Ido aims to fix these with more &quot;international&quot; or &quot;corrected&quot; roots. This can sometimes be at the expense of Esperanto's simplified word building process. Below are some examples.

&lt;!-- You may add more languages to this chart to this if you like. But please make sure they have at least 3 words that's alike to Ido. --&gt;

=== Affixes ===

The prefix ''mal-'' (creating a word with the exact opposite meaning) in Esperanto is overused as a prefix. It can be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages. 

The primary Ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the [[Latin]]-based ''sinistra'' for &quot;left&quot; instead of ''maldextra'' (''mal-'' plus the word ''dextra'', or ''dekstra'' for &quot;right&quot;) is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands. 

Ido does not assume male gender in a word.

=== Personal names ===

As stated above, most European given names have Esperanto equivalents: &quot;John&quot; is ''Johano'', &quot;Alexander&quot; is ''Aleksandro'', etc. Because some cultures place the surname first before the given name and others last after it, it is the practice of some Esperanto writers to give surnames in all capital letters, although it is unusual to find this in publications. &quot;John Smith&quot; would thus be rendered &quot;John SMITH&quot; or &quot;Johano SMITH&quot; in the first mention. Most non-Western names do not have equivalents and are rendered as close as possible in Esperanto orthography.

Ido, on the other hand, simply leaves the names as is; &quot;John Smith&quot; would be &quot;John Smith&quot; in Ido. Names from languages with non-Latin scripts are rendered as phonetically as possible. Ido does not capitalize surnames.

=== Place names ===

Most countries have their own names in Esperanto. The system of derivation, though, is sometimes complex. In Old World nations, where the country is named after an ethnic group, the main root means a person of that group: ''anglo'' is an Englishman, ''franco'' is a Frenchman. Originally, names of nations were created by the addition of the suffix ''-ujo'' (container), hence England and France would be rendered ''Anglujo'' and ''Francujo'' respectively (literally, &quot;a container full of Englishmen/Frenchmen&quot;). More recently, Esperanto has adopted ''-io'' as the national suffix, thus creating names more inline with standard international practice (and less odd-looking): ''Anglio'', ''Francio''. 

In the New World, where citizens are named for their nation, the name of the nation is the main word, and its inhabitants are derived from that: ''Kanado'' (&quot;Canada&quot;), ''kanadano'' (&quot;Canadian&quot;).

Names of cities may or may not have an Esperanto equivalent: ''Londono'' for London, ''Nov-Jorko'' for New York. Place names which lack wide-spread recognition, or which would be mangled beyond recognition usually remain in their native form: Cannes is usually rendered as &quot;Cannes&quot;.

In Ido, country names must conform to the language's orthography but otherwise are left unchanged: ''Europa'', ''Peru'', ''Amerika''. City names are treated as foreign words (London), except when part of the name itself is a regular noun or adjective: Nov-York (''Nov'' for ''nova'', or &quot;new&quot;, but the place name York is not changed as in Esperanto &quot;Nov-Jorko&quot;). This is not a hard and fast rule, however, and ''New York'' is also acceptable, similar to writing ''Köln'' for the city of ''Cologne'' in Germany. South Carolina becomes Sud-Karolina, much in the same way that a river called the &quot;Schwarz River&quot; is not transcribed as the &quot;Black River&quot; in English even though ''schwarz'' is the German word for ''black''. However, less well-known place names are generally left alone, so a small town by the name of &quot;Battle River&quot; for example would be written the same way, and not transcribed as &quot;Batalio-rivero&quot;. This is because transcribing a little-known place name would make it nearly impossible to find in the original language.

      <comment>/* 2:1 Syrup */     Alternative to dubious tartaric acid</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Occasionally it becomes necessary to supplement a colony’s diet. This may be due to lack of food stores, to encourage a particular behavior, or to medicate the entire hive. The following are recipes that are considered to be bee safe. Each of these recipes may be of benefit when supplied at the correct time. 

{| align=center style=&quot;background:#FFC4C4; border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: .2em; margin-bottom: 3px; font-size: 95%; width: 50%;&quot;
| style=&quot;padding-right: 4px; padding-left: 4px;&quot; | [[Image:Stop_hand.svg|40px|]]
| '''Warning''': Unless otherwise noted the following recipes should not be used in conjunction with a hive containing honey for non-bee consumption!
|}


==Honey==
Despite the fact that on first observation it would seem obviously correct, honey is not the best feed for bees. Honey is in essence bee food that has been processed so that it won’t spoil. When given the chance, bees prefer to eat nectar.
When honey is used as a feed, or within one of the following recipes, be sure to know the source. If at all possible only re-feed honey to the same hive it was harvested from. Never use store-bought honey. Store-bought honey may contain [[Beekeeping/Disease#American Foul Brood|AFB]] (American Foul Brood) or other such spores, which are perfectly safe for human consumption but can be deadly to bees.

==Sugar Syrup==
One of the reasons to keep bees is because you can harvest the honey that they create. After a honey harvest, it may be necessary to supply bees with an artificial honey replacement or with a source of artificial nectar, in order to prevent starvation. At other times when real nectar may be scarce or unavailable, artificial nectar can be used to encourage the drawing of comb or to aid in the rearing of brood.
It should also be noted that honey contains materials that bees can not digest and sugar syrup makes for a better source of bee feed. This does not mean that it is appropriate to take all of the bees’ honey. After all, the bees did work rather hard for it. Bees should always have excess honey in storage.
When using sugar, only use white cane sugar. Don’t used raw sugar, brown sugar or molasses as they contain impurities that may harm the bees or may be difficult for the bees to digest. If using powdered sugar instead of standard crystallized cane sugar, be sure to check the ingredients list as some powdered sugar contains anti-caking agents that might be harmful to bees.
Although the following recipes call for ingredients by weight, volume is a close enough approximation as the bees don’t particularly care about the specifics of sugar concentration. 

===1:1 Syrup===
1:1, or One-to-One syrup can be used for supplemental spring feeding and encourage the drawing of comb.

*1 part (by weight) sugar 
*1 part (by weight) water 

1:1 syrup can be made by dissolving one pound of sugar into one pint of water.
Simply stir sugar into room temperature water until all the sugar has dissolved to produce the desired quantity. The dissolving process will be sped up with hotter water, just be sure not to boil the sugar solution.  

Some beekeepers suggest that you bring the water to a rolling boil in a covered pot to kill fungus and bacteria then remove from heat and stir in the raw sugar using a spoon that has also been sterilized in boiling water.  Put the cover back on the pot and let cool to room temperature before feeding to the bees.  The sterile sugar solution will stay clean and clear for up to two weeks using this method.
  
One volume of water plus one volume of sugar when prepared equals roughly 1.5 volumes of syrup.
Weight of water = 8.34 lbs(#) per gallon  1/2 gal = 4.14#  1qt = 2.09#  1pt = 1.04# &amp; 1 cup = .52# of water.

One 2-liter bottle of water
plus
one cup of water
plus 
5 pounds of sugar 
yields just under two 2-liter bottles of &quot;close enough&quot; 1:1 Syrup

===2:1 Syrup===

2:1, or Two-to-One syrup can be used for fall feeding after the last honey harvest, or if the bees do not have a sufficiently large store of honey.

*2 parts (by weight) sugar 
*1 part (by weight) water 

The two parts sugar will not dissolve in room temperature water. Because of this mixing difficulty it is advisable to mix the sugar into near-boiling water. The best way to do this is to bring the water to a rolling boil in a covered pot and then remove from heat and stir in the raw sugar using a spoon that has also been sterilized in the boiling water.  Do not return the pot to heat and allow the sugar mixture to boil, as this will give the chance for some of the sugars to caramelize, creating a partially indigestible and possibly even toxic solution as far as the bees are concerned. Be sure to let the solution thoroughly cool before feeding it to the bees.
It was once common practice to add [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_of_tartar cream of tartar] (tartaric acid) to 2:1 syrup to prevent re-crystallization of the sugars, however this is not recommended, as it is believed to shorten the life spans of the bees that consume it. Alternatively, one could add a very small amount of vitamin C as the acid (ascorbic acid) to adjust pH to 4.5 to impede crystallisation, as an antioxidant and general tonic.

For those without a scale, an easy recipe is 5 parts granulated sugar and 2 parts water by VOLUME. Sugar is somewhere between 170 and 200 grams/cup (depends on the reference)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderandbulk.com/resources/bulk_density/material_bulk_density_chart_s.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ &lt;/ref&gt; and water is 240 grams/cup&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_weights_and_measures&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_%28unit%29&lt;/ref&gt;. So, for example, 5 cups of granulated sugar is 850-1000 grams, and 2 cups of water is 480 grams, which is close to 2:1. Picking 2:1 is a totally arbitrary ratio and is only a convenient, simple ratio for the bee keeper to think about for feeding bees late in the season.

2:1 syrup results in a final volume of syrup approximately double that of the liquid - e.g. 2kg of sugar in 1 litre of water will create 2 litres of syrup.  This is due to the dissolved volume of sugar being less than in its crystalline form.

===1:2 Syrup===

1:2, or One-to-Two syrup can be used to stimulate brood rearing by simulating a nectar flow.

*1 part (by weight) sugar 
*2 parts (by weight) water 

Simply mix the sugar with room temperature water and feed the bees.

===High Fructose Corn Syrup===

It is not uncommon for a beekeeper with many hives and little time to use [[w:High_fructose_corn_syrup|high fructose corn syrup]] in place of 2:1 syrup, however this method is not cost effective or practical for small-scale beekeepers.
When purchasing high fructose corn syrup not specifically packaged as bee feed, be sure to check the list of ingredients. Many suppliers often add extra ingredients that may not be desired when feeding bees.

A few websites referring to the danger of feeding honeybees high fructose corn syrup, since overheating it during manufacture turns some of it into a compound toxic to honeybees:

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090826110118.htm

http://www.naturalnews.com/027286_HFCS_food_honey.html

http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2009/08/20/the-bee-problem-is-hfcs-to-blame/

Does this mean that high fructose should be sold only if it is already labelled with how much of that compound it contains?

==Bee Candy==

Occasionally it is not advised to feed bees syrup. For example, over winter any liquid syrup that contains higher levels of water than stored honey runs the risk of fermenting, spoiling the stores, and risking dysentry and associated diseases for the bees.  Sometimes when emergency feeding it is best to use a dry or semi-moist food, other times bee candy is used as it is less messy than feeding syrup. Even though bee candy may be convenient to use as feed, it is not recommended as a complete substitution to syrup.

===Un-prepared Sugar===

The simplest bee candy is crystallized cane sugar. Pure sugar, while easy to handle, is generally only fed during dire emergencies, and bees sometimes will carry it out of the hive rather than consume it.

===Fondant Bee Candy===

Fondant bee candy can be fed directly to the bees once cooled. It is also common to use this recipe in small quantities to plug the hole on a [[Beekeeping/Queen Cage| Queen Cage]].

*4 parts (by volume) white sugar
*4 parts (by volume) [[#2:1 Syrup|2:1 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]]
*3 parts (by volume) water

Boil water and slowly add the syrup and sugar until dissolved. Continue heating until the mixture reaches 238&amp;deg;F (114&amp;deg;C). Allow the solution to cool (without mixing)until it is slightly warm to the touch, and begin to mix and aerate the solution, the color should lighten. Pour into shallow dishes or mold and save for later use.

===Quick Candy===

In a pinch quick candy can be used in place of  [[#Fondant Bee Candy| Fondant Bee Candy]], it is easier to prepare, but may not be as easily workable.

*1 part (by volume) confectioner’s sugar
*1 part (by volume) [[#2:1 Syrup|1:2 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]] or [[#Honey| Clean Honey]]

Simply knead the two ingredients together like bread dough until completely integrated.

NOTE* Confectioner’s sugar may contain corn starch - use a blender to make powdered sugar from granulated crystals for use in the bee hive.

==Pollen Substitute==

Occasionally there is a shortage of pollen, or perhaps you simply desire to promote the raising of brood. Pollen substitutes can be used in such situations; however, despite its name, pollen substitutes are no real substitute for genuine fresh pollen.

===Dry Pollen Substitute===

Dry pollen substitute can be placed directly into the hive or used in bird feeders to attract local bees.

*3 parts (by weight) Soy Flour (expeller-processed soybean flour)
*1 part (by weight) Brewers Yeast
*1 part (by weight) Nonfat Dry Milk (Not instant milk)


Simply integrate the powders together and use. Occasionally bees may refuse to eat pollen substitute, most often when fresh pollen is available. It is, however, possible to trick bees to take the substitute when necessary by integrating a small amount of [[w:Vitamin_c|Vitamin C]] into the mixture. Often 1 teaspoon per 5 cups can be added. If a powered form is not available, it is possible to crush a Vitamin C tablet for integration.

===Pollen Patty===

To make a pollen patty, bind the [[#Dry Pollen Substitute| Dry Pollen Substitute]] with enough [[#2:1 Syrup|2:1 Syrup]] to make a putty or dough like consistency.

==Grease Patties==

Grease Patties containing both [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Wintergreen|wintergreen oil]] or [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Tea Tree|tea tree oil]] and mineral salt appear to have an effect on [[Beekeeping/Varroa Mite|varroa mites]] and [[Beekeeping/Tracheal Mite|tracheal mites]]. These effects can be seen when brood is present, and has a devastating effect on mites when brood is not present. However, grease patties with essential oils should not be used during time of honey collection for human consumption. During this time, grease patties without essential oils can be used to a lesser effect. For any noticeable effect, a grease patty of some form should be used at all times.  Replace any consumed patties. 

===Simple Grease Patty ===

*1 part (by volume) solid vegetable shorting (such as Crisco)
*2 parts (by volume) white sugar

Mix sugar and shortening until well combined. Split into approximately quarter cup (~6 centiliters) portions and store excess in the freezer sandwiched between sheets of wax paper.

=== Grease Patty With Mineral Salt===

*2 lbs solid vegetable shorting (such as Crisco)
*3 lbs white sugar
*1 lb [[#2:1 Syrup|1:2 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]] or [[#Honey| Clean Honey]]
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cup pulverized mineral salt (~&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;lb Depending on mineral content)

Prepare the same as you would a [[#Simple Grease Patty|simple grease patty]] recipe.

=== Grease Patty With Mineral Salt and Essential Oils===

*2 lbs solid vegetable shorting (such as Crisco)
*3 lbs white sugar
*1 lb [[#2:1 Syrup|1:2 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]] or [[#Honey| Clean Honey]]
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cup pulverized mineral salt (~&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;lb Depending on mineral content)
*3 table spoons [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Wintergreen|wintergreen oil]]

Prepare the same as you would a [[#Simple Grease Patty|simple grease patty]] recipe. Remember to wear gloves when handling wintergreen oil.

===Extender Patty===

If a grease patty contains terramycin, it is called an extender patty, and was once considered one of the best ways to control AFB. As resistance has been noted with this form of application it is no longer recommended. 
For your information, the recipe is here.
 lb powdered sugar
 lb solid vegetable shortening  (such as Crisco)
 2 tablespoons Terramycin TM-25

This patty was used to eliminate three weekly dustings of powdered Terramycin. The danger is that keeping a low level of TM in the hive leads to resistance.

==Other==

The following recipes simply do not fit in to any of the previous categories, this however does not mean that they are any less useful.

===General Purpose Essential Oil Mixture===

A commercial, general purpose essential oil product for bees that is similar to the following recipe claims many benefits, but many of those claims have yet to be proven. The following recipe may work about as well as that product.
It has been known to occasionally cause [[Beekeeping/Robbing behavior| Robbing behavior]] due to its great appeal to bees.

*5 cups water
*2 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of sugar
*1/8 teaspoon lecithin granules (used as an emulsifier)
*15 drops [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Spearmint Oil|spearmint oil]] 
*15 drops [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Lemongrass Oil|lemongrass oil]] 

Bring the water to a boil and integrate the sugar until dissolved. Once the sugar is dissolved remove the mixture from the heat and quickly add the lecithin and the essential oils. Stir until everything is evenly distributed. This solution should have a strong scent and not be left open around bees. Cool before using.

===Smokeless Smoke===

A solution of [[#General Purpose Essential Oil Mixture| general purpose essential oil mixture]] and [[#1:1 Syrup| 1:1 syrup]] can be mixed and used in a standard spray or misting bottle. This solution reportedly has varied effects depending on the specific history of the hive. Because of differences between each hive it, is best to try a ten to one [1:10?] mixture of essential oil mixture to syrup and vary the ratio as necessary.   
Have your smoker readily available during your first few trials in case the bees don’t react to the solution.

===Essential Oil Scent Masking Syrup===

Nearly any [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils|essential oil]] can be mixed with a [[#1:1 Syrup| 1:1 syrup]] solution to mask an undesired scent in the hive. Among other uses, a masking syrup can be used during queen introduction or when joining two hives. Simply add the desired amount of oils to the syrup. The stronger the scent, the better it will serve to mask other scents, though be frugal as essential oils have a strong smell.

One of the more common oils to use is [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Peppermint|peppermint oil]], but be sure not to use [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Peppermint#Banana|banana oil]].

===Scent Masking Syrup===

An inexpensive scent masking syrup can be used similarly as the recipe for [[#Essential Oil Scent Masking Syrup|essential oil scent masking syrup]]. Simply prepare a [[#1:1 Syrup| 1:1 syrup]] and one or two crushed peppermint candies for every two cups of prepared solution. Load the solution into a spray bottle and use as needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Elementary Haskell}}

We have already met the basic tools for working with lists.  We can build lists up from the cons operator &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; and the empty list &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, and we can take them apart by using a combination of recursion and pattern matching. In this chapter and the next, we will consider more in-depth techniques for list processing and discover a bit of new notation. Here, we will get our first taste of characteristic Haskell features like infinite lists, list comprehensions, and higher-order functions.

{{body note|Throughout this chapter, you will read and write functions which sum, subtract, and multiply elements of lists. For simplicity's sake, we will pretend the list elements have to be of type &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;. However, as you will recall from the discussions on [[../Type basics II|Type basics II]], there are many different types with the Num typeclass. As an exercise of sorts, you could figure out what would the type signatures of such functions would be if we made them polymorphic, allowing for the list elements to have any type in the class &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;. To check your signatures, just omit them temporarily, load the functions into GHCi, use :t and let type inference guide you.
}}   

==Rebuilding lists==

We'll start by writing and analysing a function that doubles every element from a list of integers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
doubleList [] = []
doubleList (n:ns) = (2 * n) : doubleList ns
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the base case is the empty list; and it evaluates to an empty list. Otherwise, doubleList ''builds up a new list'' by using (:). The first element of this new list is twice the head of the argument, and the rest of the result is obtained by recursively calling doubleList on the tail of the argument. If the tail happens to be an empty list, the base case will be invoked and recursion stops.&lt;ref&gt;Had we forgotten the base case, once the recursion got to an empty list the (x:xs) pattern match would fail, and we would get an error.&lt;/ref&gt;

By understanding the recursive definition, we can picture what actually happens when we evaluate an expression such as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList [1,2,3,4]
&lt;/source&gt;

We can work it out longhand by substituting the argument into the function definition, just like schoolbook algebra:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList 1:[2,3,4] = (1*2) : doubleList (2 : [3,4])
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : doubleList (3 : [4])
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : (3*2) : doubleList (4 : [])
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : (3*2) : (4*2) : doubleList []
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : (3*2) : (4*2) : []
                     = 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 : []
                     = [2, 4, 6, 8]
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, we rebuilt the original list replacing every element by its double.

In this longhand evaluation exercise, the ''moment'' at which we choose to evaluate the multiplications does not affect the result. We could just as well have done them immediately after each recursive call of doubleList.&lt;ref&gt;As long as none of the calculations result in an error or nontermination, which are not problems in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;

This flexibility on evaluation order is reflected in some important properties of Haskell. As a ''pure'' functional programming language, it is mostly left to the compiler to decide when to actually evaluate things. As a ''lazy evaluation'' language, evaluation is usually deferred until the value is really needed, which may even be never in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;The compiler is still free to evaluate things sooner if it will improve efficiency.&lt;/ref&gt; From the programmer's point of view, evaluation order rarely matters.&lt;ref&gt;One exception is the case of ''infinite lists'' (!) which we will consider in a short while.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalizing ===

Suppose that we are solving a problem for which we need not only a function to double a list but also one that tripled it. In principle, we could follow the same strategy and define:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
tripleList :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
tripleList [] = []
tripleList (n:ns) = (3 * n) : tripleList ns
&lt;/source&gt;

Both &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tripleList&lt;/code&gt; have very limited applicability. Every time we needed multiplying the elements of a list by 4, 8, 17 etc. we would need to write a new list-multiplying function, and all of them would do nearly the same thing. An obvious improvement would be generalizing our function to allow multiplication by any number. Doing so requires a function that takes an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; multiplicand as well as a list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s. Here is a way to define it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList _ [] = []
multiplyList m (n:ns) = (m*n) : multiplyList m ns
&lt;/source&gt;

This example deploys &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; as a &quot;don't care&quot; pattern. The multiplicand is not used for the base case, so instead of giving it a name (like &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt;) it is explicitly ignored.

&lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; solves our current problem for any integer number:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; multiplyList 17 [1,2,3,4]
[17,34,51,68]
}}

{{Exercises|1=
Write the following functions and test them out.  Don't forget the type signatures. 

# takeInt returns the first ''n'' items in a list.  So takeInt 4 [11,21,31,41,51,61] returns [11,21,31,41].
# dropInt drops the first ''n'' items in a list and returns the rest.  so dropInt 3 [11,21,31,41,51] returns [41,51].
# sumInt returns the sum of the items in a list.
# scanSum adds the items in a list and returns a list of the running totals.  So scanSum [2,3,4,5] returns [2,5,9,14].
# diffs returns a list of the differences between adjacent items.  So diffs [3,5,6,8] returns [2,1,2]. (Hints: one solution involves writing an auxiliary function which takes two lists and calculates the difference between corresponding. Alternatively, you might explore the fact that lists with at least two elements can be matched to a &lt;code&gt;(x:y:ys)&lt;/code&gt; pattern.)
The first three functions are in Prelude, under the names &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

== Generalizing even further ==

We just wrote a function which can multiply the elements of a list by any &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;. But even though &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; is much more flexible than &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt;, it's still limited. Initially, we had a function constrained to multiplying the elements by &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, and we had to hard-code a new function to use a different number. With &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;, we could still complain about being constrained to apply multiplication to the list elements. What if we wanted to instead add to each element or to compute the square of each element? We would be back rewriting the recursive function for each case.

A key functionality of Haskell will save the day. Since the solution can be quite surprising, we will approach it in a somewhat roundabout way. Consider the type signature of &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
&lt;/source&gt;

The first thing to know is that the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; arrow in type signatures is ''right associative''. That means we can read this signature as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; ( [Integer] -&gt; [Integer] )
&lt;/source&gt;

How should we understand that? It tells us that &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes ''one'' &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; argument and evaluates to ''another function'', which in turn takes a list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s and returns another list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s.

Consider our earlier doubleList function redefined in terms of &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
doubleList xs = multiplyList 2 xs
&lt;/source&gt;

A practical consequence of what we have just said is that we can, metaphorically speaking, cancel out the `xs`:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList = multiplyList 2
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition style (with no argument variables) is called &quot;point-free&quot; style. The expressions here are perfectly well-formed and stands on their own, so writing the second argument of &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; (which is the same as the only argument of &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt;) is strictly unnecessary. Applying only one argument to &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; doesn't fail to evaluate, it just gives us just a more specific function of type &lt;code&gt;[Integer] -&gt; [Integer]&lt;/code&gt; instead of finishing with a final &lt;code&gt;[Integer]&lt;/code&gt; value.

The trickery above illustrates that functions in Haskell behave much like any other value. Functions that return other functions, and functions can stand alone as objects without mentioning their arguments. It's as though functions were just a normal constants. Could we use functions themselves as ''arguments'' even? Well, that's the key to our dilemma with &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;. We need a function that takes not only multiplication but any other appropriate function and applies the given function to the elements of a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
applyToIntegers :: (Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
applyToIntegers _ [] = []
applyToIntegers f (n:ns) = (f n) : applyToIntegers f ns
&lt;/source&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;applyToIntegers&lt;/code&gt;, we can take ''any'' &lt;code&gt;Integer -&gt; Integer&lt;/code&gt; function and apply it to the elements of a list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s. We can, of course, use this generalized function to redefine &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;. Specifically, we just use the &lt;code&gt;(*)&lt;/code&gt; function as the first argument for applyToIntegers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList = applyToIntegers (*)
&lt;/source&gt;

If all this abstraction is confusing you, consider a concrete example: When we multiply 5 * 7 in Haskell, the &lt;code&gt;(*)&lt;/code&gt; function doesn't just take two arguments at once, it actually first takes the 5 and returns a new ''5*'' function; and that new function then takes ''one'' argument and multiplies whatever that is by 5. So, we then give the 7 to the 5* function, and ''that'' returns us our final evaluated number (35 in this example).

So, all functions in Haskell really take only one argument. However, as we know how many intermediate functions will have to be generated before our final result is returned, we can ''treat'' our functions as if they took many arguments. The number of arguments we generally talk about functions taking is actually the number of functions of one argument between the first argument and the final, non-functional result value.

The process of creating intermediate functions when feeding arguments into a complex function is called ''currying'' (named after Haskell Curry, who is also the namesake of the Haskell programming language).


== The &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function ==

While &lt;code&gt;applyToIntegers&lt;/code&gt; has type &lt;code&gt;(Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]&lt;/code&gt;, there is nothing specific to integers in its algorithm. Therefore, we could define versions such as &lt;code&gt;applyToChars&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;applyToStrings&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;applyToLists&lt;/code&gt; just by changing the type signature. That would be horribly wasteful, though: we did not climb all the way up to this point just to need a different function for each type! Furthermore, nothing prevents us from changing the signature to, for instance, &lt;code&gt;(Integer -&gt; String) -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [String]&lt;/code&gt;; thus giving a function that takes a function &lt;code&gt;Integer -&gt; String&lt;/code&gt; and returns a function &lt;code&gt;[Integer] -&gt; [String]&lt;/code&gt; which applies the function originally passed as argument to each element of an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; list.

The final step of generalization, then, is to make a fully polymorphic version of &lt;code&gt;applyToIntegers&lt;/code&gt;, with signature &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt;. Such a function already exists in Prelude: it is called '''map''' and defined as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = (f x) : map f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

Using it, we can effortlessly implement functions as different as...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList = map (*)
&lt;/source&gt;

... and...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
heads :: [[a]] -&gt; [a]
heads = map head
&lt;/source&gt;
{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; heads [[1,2,3,4],[4,3,2,1],[5,10,15]]
[1,4,5]
}}

&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is the ideal general solution for applying a function to each element of a list. Our original &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt; problem was just a very specific version of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Functions like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; which take other functions as arguments are called ''higher-order functions'', and they are extremely useful. In particular, we will meet some other important higher-order functions used for list processing in the next chapter.

{{Exercises|1=
# Use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; to build functions that, given a list xs of Ints, return:
#* A list that is the element-wise negation of xs.
#* A list of lists of Ints xss that, for each element of xs, contains the divisors of xs. You can use the following function to get the divisors: &lt;pre&gt;divisors p = [ f | f &lt;- [1..p], p `mod` f == 0 ]&lt;/pre&gt;
#* The element-wise negation of xss.
# Implement a Run Length Encoding (RLE) encoder and decoder.
#* The idea of RLE is simple; given some input:&lt;pre&gt;&quot;aaaabbaaa&quot;&lt;/pre&gt; compress it by taking the length of each run of characters:&lt;code&gt;(4,'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'a')&lt;/code&gt;
#* The &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt; functions might be helpful.  In order to use &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt;, you will need to import the Data.List module.  You can access this by typing &lt;code&gt;:m Data.List&lt;/code&gt; at the ghci prompt, or by adding &lt;code&gt;import Data.List&lt;/code&gt; to your Haskell source code file.
#* What is the type of your &lt;code&gt;encode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;decode&lt;/code&gt; functions?
#* How would you convert the list of tuples (e.g. &lt;code&gt;[(4,'a'), (6,'b')]&lt;/code&gt;) into a string (e.g. &quot;4a6b&quot;)?
#* (bonus) Assuming numeric characters are forbidden in the original string, how would you parse that string back into a list of tuples?
}}

==Tips and Tricks==

Before we carry on with more list processing, let us make a few miscellaneous useful observations about lists in Haskell.

===Dot Dot Notation===
Haskell has a convenient shorthand for writing ordered lists of regularly-spaced integers. Some examples to illustrate it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Code             Result
----             ------
[1..10]          [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[2,4..10]        [2,4,6,8,10]
[5,4..1]         [5,4,3,2,1]
[1,3..10]        [1,3,5,7,9]
&lt;/source&gt;

The same notation can be used with characters as well, and even with floating point numbers - though the latter is not necessarily a good idea due to rounding errors. Try this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
[0,0.1 .. 1]
&lt;/source&gt;

{{body note|The &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; notation ''only'' works with sequences with fixed differences between consecutive elements. For instance, you cannot write...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8..100]
&lt;/source&gt;

... and expect to magically get back the rest of the Fibonacci series.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Infinite Lists===
One of the most mind-bending things about Haskell lists is that they are allowed to be ''infinite''.  For example, the following generates the infinite list of integers starting with 1:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
[1..]
&lt;/source&gt;

(If you try this in GHCi, remember you can stop an evaluation with Ctrl-c).

The same effect could be achieved with a recursive function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
intsFrom n = n : intsFrom (n+1) -- note there is no base case!
positiveInts = intsFrom 1
&lt;/source&gt;

This works because Haskell uses lazy evaluation: it never actually evaluates more than it needs at any given moment.  In most cases an infinite list can be treated just like an ordinary one.  The program will only go into an infinite loop when evaluation would actually require all the values in the list.  Examples of this include sorting or printing the entire list.  However:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
evens = doubleList [1..]
&lt;/source&gt;

will define &quot;evens&quot; to be the infinite list [2,4,6,8..].  You can pass &quot;evens&quot; into other functions, and this will work as long as you only need to evaluate part of the list for your ''final'' result.

Infinite lists are quite useful in Haskell.  Often it's more convenient to define an infinite list and then take the first few items than to create a finite list.  Functions that process two lists in parallel generally stop with the shortest, so making the second one infinite avoids having to find the length of the first.  An infinite list is often a handy alternative to the traditional endless loop at the top level of an interactive program.

===A note about &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;===

Given the choice of using either the &lt;code&gt;( : )&lt;/code&gt; pattern or &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; to split lists, pattern matching is almost always preferable. While it may be tempting to use &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; due to simplicity and terseness, it is all too easy to forget that they fail on empty lists - and runtime crashes are never a good thing. While the Prelude function &lt;code&gt;null :: [a] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; provides a sane way of checking for empty lists without pattern matching (it returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; for empty lists and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; otherwise), matching an empty list tends to be cleaner and clearer than the corresponding if-then-else expression.

{{Exercises|1=
#With respect to your solutions to the first set of exercises in this chapter, is there any difference between &lt;code&gt;scanSum (takeInt 10 [1..])&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;takeInt 10 (scanSum [1..])&lt;/code&gt;?
#In the final block of exercises of the previous chapter you implemented the (!!) operator. Redo it, but this time using head and tail. (If by any chance you did it with head and tail back then, redo it with pattern matching.)
#Write functions that, when applied to lists, give the ''last'' element of the list and the list with the last element dropped. That can be done either with pattern matching or by using head and tail only. We suggest you to try, and compare, both approaches.&lt;br/&gt;This functionality is provided by Prelude through the &lt;tt&gt;last&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt; functions.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Finland|Cuisine of Finland]]

[[Image:Karjalanpiirakka-20060227.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Karjalanpiirakka, made by Leipomo Eho (a bakery in Helsinki)]]

'''Karelian pasties''' (''Karjalanpiirakat'' in Finnish) are traditional pasties from North Karelia, Finland. Today they are eaten throughout Finland. According to the traditional recipe the pasties are made from a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Butter, often mixed with boiled egg (''[[Cookbook:Egg Butter|munavoi]]''), is spread over the hot pasties before eating.

There are also versions with carrot or potato filling.

== Ingredients ==
=== Filling ===
* 0,5 litre of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 3 dl [[Cookbook:Porridge|porridge]] [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 9 dl [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1,5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Crust ===
* 2 dl cold water
* 1,5 tsp salt
* 3,5 dl rye [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1,5 dl [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] flour

=== Moistening ===
* 1 dl milk
* 50 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

=== Egg-butter spread (munavoi) ===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 50 g butter
* 0,25 tsp salt (optional)
* 0,5 cans, 125 g, [[Cookbook:Cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] (optional)

== Procedure ==
=== Filling ===
# Mix the rice into boiling water reserved for the filling. Boil until the water has saturated the rice.
# Add the milk and stir the filling for a few minutes. Reduce heat and agitate the porridge. The cooking time is about 40 minutes. Stir the porridge every now and then.
# When the porridge is ready, it will seem thickish. Then add the salt. Cool the porridge.

=== Crust ===
# Mix the flours and salt into the cold water.
# Make the dough smooth and pliable by moulding it by hands on a panification support.
# Shape the dough into a smooth bar and divide it into about twenty pieces.
# Roll the pieces into balls, flatten them into small cakes and cover them with plastic.
# Roll the cakes into thin sheets that have approximately 17 cm in diameter.

=== Baking the pasties ===
# Lay porridge on each cake so that the porridge reaches the ends.
# Pinch the edges together with your fingers.
# Bake the pasties in about 250-300 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes until the rye crust is brown in colour.

=== Finishing ===
# Moisten the pasties from both sides with hot mixture of milk and butter.
# Lay the pasties on each other and brew them under a towel and bacon paper.
# Mix the ''munavoi'' ingredients (boil the eggs for 12 minutes) and use it as butter on the pasties.

Marketing your movie on-line is very much like marketing any product anywhere. It will always be easier and less expensive to market a product that meets the needs of a specific group. If you feel that everyone will want or need your product, you will show a profit sooner if you market to specific segments individually rather than attempt to capture the entire market at one time. By addressing a specific segment of the purchasing group you will be able to tailor your web site to the needs of that buyer more effectively. Single men and women may both need your product but express their concerns or needs in a different manner. Attempting to meet the needs of both will dilute the essential message necessary to show the buyer you understand their problem (escape boredom, need to know) and this product will solve it for them.

==Fill a Need==

Perhaps the most essential step to moving your movies online is to establish a target audience for your product.  For this to come across effectively, you first must establish what you intend your product to do.
For example, you may wish your product to:

* Tell a story
* Entertain the consumer
* Inform the consumer

Once you have the purpose in mind, you must next select the target audience you wish to embrace.

== Identify the Target Audience ==

Now you must design your site to fulfill the expectations of the target audience for your product.
Some of these audiences include, but are not solely limited to:

* Adults
* Children
* Men
* Women
* Professionals
* Particular age groups
* Particular ethnic groups

Understanding your audience's expectations is one key to creating a friendly and effective sales environment for your site.

== Product Form, Delivery, and Price ==

Today's distribution media and channels are ultimately limited only by your own imagination.  
You may choose to distribute your film by using:

* [[Wikipedia:DVD|DVD]]
* [[Wikipedia:VHS|VHS]] (or other format cassettes, though VHS is the standard)
* [[Wikipedia:Video CD|Video CD]]
* Direct Download
* [[Wikipedia:Streaming media|Online (streaming) Media]]

You may distribute your film through:

* Your own web site (though this is known to meet with limited success)
* Distributors ([[Wikipedia:Amazon.com|Amazon]] [http://www.amazon.com ], [[Wikipedia:Barnes &amp; Noble|Barnes &amp; Noble]] [http://www.barnesandnoble.com ], and similar resellers)
* Other storefronts, as a &quot;special deal&quot; with other products (a romantic movie could be sold at an online or bricks-and-mortar flower shop)

Be sure to set a price appropriate to both the distribution medium and channel.

== Manufacture and Delivery ==

Now that you have a target audience and distribution channels in place, you must decide how to handle the manufacture and delivery of your final product.  
Some options include:

* Buy and warehouse stock (though this can be costly)
* Keep a small inventory on hand with rapid re-order ability
* Burn or reproduce as needed

== Collecting Payments ==

There are several methods of accepting payment via the Internet, but perhaps the best is to choose a &quot;shopping cart&quot; service that accepts as many forms of payment as possible.  
Among these should be: 

* Credit card orders ([[Wikipedia:American Express|American Express]], [[Wikipedia:Visa (credit card)|Visa]], [[Wikipedia:MasterCard|MasterCard]], [[Wikipedia:Discover Card|Discover]])
* [[Wikipedia:PayPal|PayPal]] [http://www.paypal.com ]
* Check and/or money orders
* Cash and/or wire transfers

== Advertising ==

Once your site is fully operational, you will want to make your product as visible to as many different entities as possible.  
To achieve this, you should:

* Exchange links with as many acceptable sites as possible
* Hand out promotional flyers with your site's address in a prominent position (top-center works best)
* Watch for news stories that allow you to offer information and earn referrals where you may mention your site
* Get T-shirts printed to advertise your site - have your friends wear them in public when acceptable
* Attend and speak at events of interest to your target audience 

== Wrapping It All Up ==

Now that your site is functional and your advertising machine is in full-gear, all you need to do now is to establish and maintain a valid accounting system and prepare for your next movie!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first completely free BSD was 386BSD, at times called, &quot;Jolix,&quot; due to it's development by former Berkeley students William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz.  This lead to immediate issues, due to the Jolitzes' control over the system, as conflicts between outside developers and users and the duo as to how the system should be developed, and to what end.

After the release of 386BSD 0.1 in July of 1992 bug fixes and enhancements to the newly created operating system began to build up into significant code contributions, which had to be maintained outside the 386BSD repository.  This lead to the developers working on these patches releasing them as an unofficial patchkit, and, as Jolitzes and patchkit maintainers had difficulty working together, these outside developers founded the FreeBSD project in 1993 to continue their work without having to depend on the Jolitzes.  At the same time, another group of people were becoming frustrated with 386BSD development, and of the work done by the patchkit developers, and so began their own project.

NetBSD was originally derived from the 4.3BSD release from the Computer Systems Research Group of the University of California, Berkeley, via the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases. The project began as a result of frustration within the 386BSD developer community with the pace and direction of the operating system's development. The four founders of the NetBSD project, Chris Demetriou, Theo de Raadt, Adam Glass and Charles Hannum, felt that a more open development model would be beneficial to the project; one which was centered on portable, clean, correct code. Their aim was to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system. The name, &quot;NetBSD,&quot; was suggested by de Raadt, based on the importance and growth of networks such as the Internet at that time, and distributed, collaborative nature of its development.

The NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the first official release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April, 1993. This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements. The first multi-platform release, NetBSD 1.0, was made in October 1994. Later the same year, for disputed reasons, one of the founders, Theo de Raadt, was forced out of the project. He later founded a new project, OpenBSD, from a forked version of NetBSD 1.0 near the end of 1995.

FreeBSD - tell about how they started just to try improving the BSD release from the University of California Berkley

NetBSD - tell about how the project started based on a dislike of the system being used at the time by the FreeBSD people and the difference in the direction they started in

OpenBSD - tell about the project's founding through a developer conflict, Theo's interest in debugging and securing code

GNU - tell about the founding of the FSF, talk about the lisp and MIT stuff Richard Stallman went through

Linux - tell about a student wanting a Minix kernel

Apache - tell about the starting of a patchy webserver

Keep all these direct and to the point, this is to be the shortest chapter.  Try to list the most accurate founding dates as possible.

Talk about networking basics, ARPANET and TCP/IP.

Hey the page is very informative, concise, clear and encouraging :), keep the great job, and here's just  an idea for the declensions patterns: &lt;br&gt;

except for fem. nouns in -sc, the following are universal, also for nouns like 'mezczyzna':&lt;br&gt;


 CASE    SG ENDING      PL ENDING
 Nom        -a            *
 Gen        -i or -y**    - with stem o-ó
 Dat        *             -om
 Acc        -ę (pron. e)  *
 Ins        -ą (pron. om) -ami
 Loc        *             -ach

Now, * stands for the following rule:&lt;br&gt; 
If plural ends in -y then Dat and Loc take -ie plus softening where applies (kobiety, kobiecie,  kobiecie).&lt;br&gt;
If plural ends in -i then Dat and Loc take -e plus softening where applies (rzeki, rzece, rzece)&lt;br&gt;
If plural ends in -e then Dat and Loc take -i or -y** as in Gen (ulice, ulicy, ulicy).&lt;br&gt;

In other words, Dat sg and Loc sg follow the Nom pl. &lt;br&gt;

Now, ** the -i or -y also depends regularly on the preceding consonant, can't recount now which ones.. however, most foreigners pronounce y as i anyway, and are perfectly understood, so it should hardly matter. &lt;br&gt;

yours,&lt;br&gt;

== Inexpensive stopped muting ==
Many horn players own stopping mutes for when the music calls for them. If ever you are playing stopped passages, these come in handy. However, mutes can be expensive. A similar device can be created inexpensively.

'''Materials:'''
* a styrofoam cup
* a pencil or pen
* a straw (optional)
* a pair of scissors (optional)

#Puncture the bottom of the cup with the pen or pencil.
#Optionally, insert the straw into the hole. Cutting the length of the straw with scissors to desired length is recommended.
#Move the straw in and out of the cup while the &quot;mute&quot; is in the horn and you are playing. Tune the mute by adjusting the straw with an electronic tuner.

This is not a perfect substitute for a real stopping mute, but works when in a pinch.

== Water emptying ==
As a consequence of a hornist blowing warm, moist air through metal pipes, a great deal of water condenses and comes together in liquid form inside the instrument. When too much water has condensed, airflow is obstructed and one can hear unmusical ''flops'' and ''pops'' while playing. The water must then be removed.

Hornists usually use gravity to their advantage when removing water. Often, the horn can be rotated so that the water can pour out of the lead pipe.

While every horn is different, there is one trick for emptying water out of the valve slides that is universal across all horns.
#Hold the horn so that the bell is above everything else and the valves are pointed straight to the ground.
#Depress all three valves. Hold it this way for at least two seconds.
#Lift off the first two valves while keeping the third down.
#Rotate the horn back to its normal position and keep rotating until the valves are no longer parallel to the ground.
#Remove the third-valve pipes. All the water was moved into these pipes and can be dumped quickly.

== An Easy High C ==
This works on most horns:
#Play a C in the treble staff, using the F side of the horn.
#Press the first valve lever partially down.
#Continue to push it further down until the note jumps up an octave on its own.

While learning this one, remember that your lips are not buzzing the high C, they are buzzing the C in the staff the whole time.

== Whistle Through Your Horn ==
This one is quite useless:

#Remove the tubing from one of your tuning slides.
#Push down the valves in such a way that the airstream would go through the tubing you removed.
#With your mouth in the mouthpiece, form an embouchure that is like whistling and also is like a recorder's mouthpiece.
#Blow lightly.

      <comment>/* Booleans */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">So far the only basic types we have looked at are Integers and Lists, although passing mention was made of strings and characters.  This section will cover the major basic types.

An important thing to understand about the built-in types of Haskell is that they are not particularly special.  From the compiler's point of view they are special because processors have special operations to do things like integer addition, but from the programmer's point of view they are just ordinary types with ordinary functions that follow exactly the same rules as any other type.  Hence this section contains very little in the way of explanation on how you use these types or what the rules are, because for the most part you already know it: if it works for integers then it works for strings, booleans and floats.

== Integers ==

Haskell has two types for integer numbers: Int and Integer.

&quot;Integer&quot; is an arbitrary precision type: it will hold any number no matter how big, up to the limit of your machine's memory.  That is why &quot;factorial 1000&quot; gives you the right answer.  This means you never have arithmetic overflows.  On the other hand it also means your arithmetic is relatively slow.  Lisp users may recognise the &quot;bignum&quot; type here.

&quot;Int&quot; is the more common 32 or 64 bit integer.  Implementations vary, although it is guaranteed to be at least 30 bits.

== Reals ==

Haskell also has two types for floating point: Float and Double.  These behave like the corresponding types in C.

== Arithmetic operators ==

All the usual operators are there, along with some extras. 

: Aside: Haskell numeric types are tied together in a complicated hierarchy of classes, which will be described later.  The purpose of this page is to give you enough to do ordinary arithmetic without tripping over the type system.

There are three &quot;raise to the power&quot; operators which work differently and take different argument types.

; ** : Takes two floating point numbers and uses logarithms to compute the power.
; ^^ : Takes a fractional number (i.e. a floating point or a ratio, of which more later) and raises it to a positive or negative integer power.
; ^ : Takes any numerical type and raises it to a positive integer power.

Conversion from an integer type (Int or Integer) to anything else is done by &quot;fromIntegral&quot;.  The target type is inferred automatically.  So for example:

 n :: Integer
 n = 6
 x :: Float
 x = fromIntegral n
 
 m :: Int
 m = 7
 y :: Double
 y = fromIntegral m

will define x to be 6.0 and y to be 7.0.

Division of integers is a little complicated.  If you use the ordinary &quot;/&quot; operator on integers then you will get an error message (although the expression &quot;4/3&quot; does work because Haskell helpfully promotes literal integers to floats where necessary).  Instead integer division is done using a collection of named operators.

Haskell has a neat trick with operators: you can take any function that takes two arguments and use it like an operator by enclosing the name in back-ticks.  So the following two lines mean exactly the same:

  d = 7 `div` 3
  d = div 7 3

With that in mind, here are the integer division operators:

; quot : Returns the quotient of the two numbers.  This is the result of division which is then truncated towards zero.
; rem : Returns the remainder from the quotient.
; div : Similar to &quot;quot&quot;, but is rounded down towards minus infinity.
; mod : Returns the modulus of the two numbers.  This is similar to the remainder, but has different rules when &quot;div&quot; returns a negative number.

Provided y is not negative then the following two equations will always hold:

 (x `quot` y)*y + (x `rem` y) == x
 (x `div`  y)*y + (x `mod` y) == x

Just as you can convert a function with two arguments into an operator, you can convert an operator into a function with two arguments: just put it in parentheses. So the following two lines mean the same thing:

 (+) 3 4
 3 + 4

This can also be done with any &quot;incomplete&quot; operator application:

 (3+) 4
 (+4) 3 -- not 3 (+4)

== Booleans ==

Haskell has a boolean type &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, with two values: &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt;. There are also two operators defined on the &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt; type: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;.

Numbers, characters and strings can be compared using the usual comparison operators to produce a Bool value:

; &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; : Equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt; : Not equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; : Less than or equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; : Greater than or equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;  : Less than.
; &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  : Greater than.

(When you learn about [[../Classes and types|type classes]], note that the equality operators (&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;) are part of the type class &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt;, and the comparison operators (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) are part of the type class &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt;.)

Haskell has an &quot;if-then-else&quot; clause, but because Haskell is a functional language it is more akin to the &quot;? :&quot; operator of C: rather than &quot;doing&quot; either the &quot;then&quot; clause or the &quot;else&quot; clause, the whole expression evaluates to one of them. For example, the factorial function could be written

 factorial n =
    if n &lt;= 0
       then 1
       else n * factorial (n-1)

The syntax of an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expression is:

   if &lt;condition&gt; then &lt;true-value&gt; else &lt;false-value&gt;

If the condition is True then the result of the &quot;if&quot; is the true-value, otherwise it is the false-value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavGeneral}}
== &quot;French&quot; horn? ==
The [http://hornsociety.org International Horn Society] recommended in 1971 that the instrument be recognized in English simply as &quot;the horn&quot;. No other language includes a nationalistic reference for the name of the instrument. Here are a few examples of the name of the instrument in other languages:
* French: ''Cor d'harmonie''
* Spanish, Italian: ''Trompa'', ''Corno''
* German: ''Horn''
* Hebrew: ''Keren Yaar''
* Mandarin: ''Yuan How''

== Terminology ==
[[Image:Horn.png]]
* '''Mouthpiece''': A detatchable piece of metal which comes in contact with the player's lips. A large number of different mouthpieces can be bought, each with a unique ''rim width'', ''cup diameter'', ''cup width'' and ''bore size''. Mouthpieces can be made to be silver- or gold-plated. Typically, silver is for firm, dry contact and gold is for loose, wet contact.
* '''Lead-pipe''': The pipe of which air enters from the mouthpiece and flows toward the ''main tuning slide''.
* '''Valves''': Keys which can be depressed to change the total length of the instrument. 
* '''Pinky-ring''': The curved piece of metal which the pinky-finger is placed in to help hold up the instrument. (Note: Some horn players have modified their horns and replaced the pinky-ring with another device that puts less stress on the pinky, allowing the rest of the hand to be more flexible)
* '''Bell''': The large opening of which the right-hand is placed in and sound emerges from.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Beekeeper's Perspective==

One reason why more people do not engage in the hobby and profession of beekeeping is that bees are frightening, or may seem so. A small proportion of the population will have a '''specific phobia''', which may or may not have developed after a specific traumatic experience (or lack of experience/opportunity to engage with bees in the natural environment), but will almost certainly have had its onset in childhood. Interestingly, many people are able to adapt their phobic reactions in the presence of children, because it is well-known children can exhibit fear after seeing a display from their elders. The peak ages for developing phobias are 2-6 and the early teenage years. This is when people are making career decisions and developing other aspects of their identity. A simple phobia may influence work in the field, as in those who want to be doctors or veterinarians but cannot stand blood.
Some beekeepers treat their bees like their children, and very often may not appear to be sympathetic and understanding to phobic reactions. They may believe their bees can't possibly hurt anyone, having thought it through rationally with their experience. It is important not to exclude the possibility that some beekeepers may also have a current phobia, or have successfully overcome their phobia.

==The Phobic's Perspective==
(This is a first-person description of common fears that a person exposed to bees could have, and is thus hypothetical. Keep in mind that many fears have not a specific trigger.)
Bees are dangerous. Their sting could kill me and I might have an allergic reaction. I might avoid everything to do with bees-in an extreme circumstance I will avoid consuming [[Beekeeping/Varieties_of_Honey#Manuka|Manuka honey]], even though I know it is good for my sore throat and general functioning. I have terrible pictures in my mind-indeed everything I see, hear, taste, smell and touch which reminds me of bees creates a reaction in my nervous system, which makes me want to die. I even avoid gardens and flowers, and try to buy dull flowers for my garden. The flowers don't get pollinated, so I have a really shocking garden as the flowers didn't grow. I just can't get over the sight of my cousin being stung by a bee. She was four. She was defenseless.

==The medical perspective==
Psychologists and psychiatrists usually take care of phobias. Two treatments, both relatively brief, are effective for phobias. These include the guiding principles of desensitization and exposure. Beekeepers in particular should be aware that exposure is seldom good without desensitization, and normally specific goals are in mind before this process is applied. Family and friends are usually good at accommodating anxiety-producing situations, unless they seriously interfere with life. Phobias are usually best dealt with when the person is calm, and indirect, neutral surroundings are generally used in the first stage. For example, somebody who has a mild to moderate bee phobia could be encouraged by her therapist to read this Wikibook, knowing that the bees are treated in a caring and sensitive manner. Therapy focuses on modifying cognitions (thinking - for example: Bees are dangerous all the time, in all circumstances) and affective reaction (emotion - for example: I just can't get over the sight of my cousin...She was defenseless), to see whether they are rational or not (obviously, the effect on the garden may not be entirely rational, but the possibility of the allergic reaction may be).
The fear of bees is called ''apiphobia''. You as a beekeeper are entitled to ask for a medical certificate, and simple information may be released if the phobic consents. If a friend or relative has this phobia, tread especially carefully. Make sure your bees are well controlled. Many phobias are worse in a crowd, reflecting the fact that bees and humans are social animals.
The first principle of the beekeeper may be akin with the one of the doctor: &quot;First do no harm&quot;. If you can assure the phobic you are doing no harm in your livelihood, you will significantly reduce her fear and anxiety. Often people who used to be afraid of bees are your greatest converts and assets, and it is important to keep their concerns in mind, so your hive is a safe and happy place to be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Runny hunny.jpg|thumb|right|Honey]]
There exist greater than 300 different distinct types of honey. Flavor, aroma and color of a honey can differ substantially based on the flowers that nectar was collected from. Honey flavors range from slight hints of sweetness to great bounds of distinct flavor, its flavors similarly can run the gambit of being a clear as water to a deep dark brown. There exist as many flavors of honey in the world as exists combinations of blossoms in bloom at the same time. The following is simply a sampling of some of the more popular or more common honey varieties.
If you wish to obtain one or more of these varieties of honey the [http://www.nhb.org/ National Honey Board] provides a free of charge [http://www.honeylocator.com/  listings of distributors] for many varieties.

| '''Warning''': Honey should not be fed to infants under the age of 1 or to people with sever immune system deficiencies.  This is due to possibility of botulism spores being present. This level of botulism will have no ill effect on a healthy person.

==Alfalfa==
Alfalfa honey has a sweet mild flavor with a scent similar to bees wax. The honey ranges from a near clear to a light amber color. Alfalfa is an important honey crop in the western United States.

==Apple Blossom==
[[Image:Appletree_bloom_l.jpg|thumb|left|Blooming Apple Tree]]
Apple blossom honey is a light golden in color and may have a hint of apple in scent. Apple blossoms are an important source of honey during the spring in the northern and central US.

==Dandelion==

Often considered a weed plant, the dandelion is one of the first nectar sources available to the bees during the new spring. The honey created from this flower reportedly has a strong taste and an unmistakable flowery scent.

==Fire Weed==
Fireweed produces a honey that is nearly crystal clear. It’s the combination of its sweet and mild flavor alongside its color makes it a popular variety.

==Manuka==
Found only in New Zealand’s coastal areas, Manuka produces nectar that is turned to honey that reportedly has more medical uses than most honeys. Manuka honey is noted for treatment of a sore throat and aiding in the healing of wounds.

==Orange Blossom==
A popular honey variety that is harvested in Florida, Texas, California and Arizona with in the US. Orange blossom honey is an light amber with a distinctive flavor and the scent of an orange blossom.

==White Dutch Clover==
This stemless flower producer is one of the leading honey crops in the US. The honey produced from the White Dutch Clover has a sweet flowery flavor and a pleasant mild taste.

==Wildflower==
Wildflower honey is created from nonspecific nectar sources. It is made during a time and area when multiple varieties of nectar bearing flowers are in bloom. Depending on the time of year and the location gathered, wildflower honey can be drastically different in flavor color and aroma.

== Learning Thai (เรียนภาษาไทย) ==

[[Image:Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|320 px|right|วัดพระศรีรัตนศาสดาราม-Temple of the Emerald Buddha]]
Thai language (ภาษาไทย-phāːsǎːthāi) is official language of Thailand.

Like Chinese and some other Asian languages, spoken Thai is a tonal language. That means that by changing the tone of a spoken word you can change its meaning. This can be confusing for people whose first language is non-tonal, such as the European languages. The written Thai word however, is not so confusing because words with different tones are spelled differently. Though like English, it is possible for words with the same tone but different meanings, to be spelled differently too ('feet' and 'feat')

Example of some Thai words highlighting the different tones.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+'''Thai'''
!Thai Word!!Pronunciation key!!Meaning!!Tone
|-
|คา||khā||stuck||mid
|-
|ข่า||khà||galangal||low
|-
|ข้า||khâ||servant||falling
|-
|ค่า||khâ||value||falling
|-
|ฆ่า||khâ||to kill||falling
|-
|ค้า||khá||to trade, to sell||high
|-
|ขา||khǎ||leg||rising
|}

The following table is comparing Chinese with Thai about their tones. Note that pronunciation key is adapted form English alphabets with IPA tone markers for Thai. '''It is not same as pinyin tone marker at all.'''
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+'''Chinese'''
!Chinese Word!!Pinyin!!Meaning
|-
|妈||mā||mother
|-
|麻||má||hemp
|-
|马||mǎ||horse
|-
|骂||mà||scold
|-
|吗||ma||(used as last word of question)
|-
|}
Many Thai phrasebooks use pronunciation key without tone marker, even though Thai is tonal language. If you want to speak Thai correctly, you have to study its tone, otherwise Thai people will have trouble understanding what you say.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Systems Theory Page}}

== Goal Seeking ==

Control systems or Cybernetics are characterized by the fact that they have goals: states of affairs that they try to achieve and maintain, in spite of obstacles or perturbations

Control systems are combinations of components (electrical, mechanical, thermal, or hydraulic) that act together to maintain actual system performance close to a specified set of performance specifications. Open-loop control systems (e.g. alarm clocks) are those in which the output has no effect on the input. Closed-loop control systems (e.g. automotive cruise-control systems) are those in which the output has an effect on the input in such a way as to maintain the specified output value. A closed-loop system must include some way to measure its output to sense changes so that corrective action can be taken. The speed with which a simple closed-loop control system moves to correct its output is described by its natural frequency and damping ratio. A system with a small damping ratio is characterized by overshooting the desired output before settling down. Systems with larger damping ratios do not overshoot the desired output, but respond more slowly.

== Mechanistic World View ==

In the mechanistic world view, there is no place for goal-directedness or purpose. All mechanical processes are determined by their cause, which lies in the past. A goal, on the other hand, is something that determines a process, yet lies in the future. 

The thesis that natural processes are determined by their future purpose is called teleology. It is closely associated with vitalism, the belief that life is animated by a vital force outside the material realm. Our mind is not a goalless mechanism; it is constantly planning ahead, solving problems, trying to achieve goals. How can we understand such goal-directedness without recourse to the doctrine of teleology?

== Cybernetics ==

Probably the most important innovation of cybernetics is its explanation of goal-directedness. An autonomous system, such as a person or an organism, can be characterized by the fact that it pursues its own goals, resisting obstructions from the environment that would make it deviate from its preferred state of affairs. Thus, goal-directedness implies regulation of or control over distractions. 

A good example is a room in which the temperature is controlled by a thermostat. The setting of the thermostat determines the desired temperature or goal state. Perturbations may be caused by changes in the outside temperature, opening of windows or doors, drafts, etc. The task of the thermostat is to minimize the effects of such influences, and thus to keep the temperature as much as possible constant with respect to the specified temperature.

== Survival ==

On the most fundamental level, the goal of an autopoietic or autonomous system is survival, that is, maintenance of its essential organization. This goal has been built into all living organisms by natural selection: those that were not focused on survival have simply been eliminated. In addition to this main goal, the system will have various subsidiary goals, such as keeping warm or finding food, that indirectly contribute to its survival. Artificial systems, such as automatic pilots and thermostats, are not autonomous: their primary goals are constructed in them by their designers. They are allopoietic: which means their function is to produce something other (&quot;allo&quot;) than themselves.

== Goals as States ==

Goal-directedness can be defined most simply as suppression of deviations from an invariant goal state. In that respect, a goal is similar to a stable equilibrium, to which the system returns after any disruptions. Both goal-directedness and stability are characterized by equifinality: different initial states lead to the same final state, implying the destruction of variety. What distinguishes them is that a stable system automatically returns to its equilibrium state, without performing any work or effort. But a goal-directed system must actively engage to achieve and maintain its goal, which would not be equilibrium otherwise.
Control may appear essentially conservative, resisting all departures from a preferred state. But the net effect can be very progressive or dynamic, depending on the complexity of the goal. For example, if the goal is defined as the rate of increase of some quantity, or the distance relative to a moving target, then suppressing deviation from the goal implies constant change. A simple example is a heat-seeking head in a Stinger missile attempting to reach a fast moving enemy jet, cruise missile or helicopter. 

A system's &quot;goal&quot; can also be a range of acceptable states, similar to an attractor. The dimensions defining these states are called the essential variables, and they must be kept within a limited range compatible with the survival of the system. For example, a person's body temperature must be kept within a range of approximately 35-40 degrees C. Even more generally, the goal can be seen as a gradient, or &quot;fitness&quot; function, defined on state space, which defines the degree of &quot;preference&quot; or &quot;value&quot; of one state relative to another one. In the latter case, the problem of control becomes one of on-going optimization or maximization of fitness.

If you could see your future, would you try to make it better? If you were a Soviet in 1980 and you knew that [http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm spiraling debt] would destroy your country, would you do something to stop it?  If you were a German in 1933 and knew that the [[w:USA_Patriot_Act#Comparisons_to_historical_laws|''Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State'']] would lead to a world war, tens of millions of deaths, and the leveling of your nation, would you oppose it?

Its safe to assume that we would all say ''yes'' to these questions.  Our only excuse in letting these patterns reoccur is a claim that we can't see the future with any degree of certainty, but is this claim true?  Couldn't the Soviets have deduced their overwhelmingly probable financial failure based on a combination of proven economic and socio-political models?  Couldn't the Germans have deduced from history that support of absolute power always leads to failure?  Why would the Germans have supported [[w:USA_Patriot_Act#Comparisons_to_historical_laws|a document]] that circumvented their basic human rights when they had hundreds of examples throughout history that such documents are always eventually used for tyranny and oppression?  How could Soviets have possibly thought that the government could endlessly support citizens who took more than they gave to the collective without going bankrupt?  On top of that, how did they expect their government to survive financially while maintaining a horrendously expensive and unwinnable war in the Middle East?  How could they have not seen the future when it was so evident?  What good is history if we cannot learn from its mistakes and plot a better course for the future?  These are some of the questions that futurology attempts to illuminate.

Futurology also uses aspects of multiple disciplines to anticipate forces of nature and predict how we will react to those forces.  In our fight for survival against natural threats, our ability to plan for a future that has no historic precedent gives us an advantage over other life-forms on this planet, including those that were extinguished eons ago.  For instance, taking into consideration various aspects of [[w:Weather_forecasting|weather forecasting]], mathematical [[w:Probability|probability]], [[w:Economics|economics]], and [[w:Hydraulic_engineering|hydraulic engineering]], a futurologist could predict that the New Orleans foundation code requiring only seven days of submersion allowance would not be economically sound.  This would be based on the likelihood of a category-five hurricane, the engineered strength of the dikes in the face of such a hurricane, the amount of seawater likely to breach the dikes, how long it would take get rid of the water, and how much it would cost to replace the foundations of those structures that were underground for more than seven days.  A hundred years ago, foundations in New Orleans were built so that they could withstand being submerged for ''weeks'' without losing structural integrity.  The building costs associated with that level of stability came to be considered overkill, not because the likelihood of level-five hurricanes diminished, but because of one additional futurology consideration: a hundred years ago, the federal government would never have paid for the rebuilding of New Orleans.  Even though [[w:Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane Katrina]] was entirely a force of nature, a futurologist must also take into consideration socio-political trends and the needs of his client.  In externalizing costs associated with long-term risks, futurologists have become invaluable resources for shaping corporate-sponsored government legislation.

Methods of quantifying the effectiveness of corporate futurologists have become a complex science in itself, one that seeks to objectively define the difference between fantasy, science fiction, and science.  This textbook explores those differences and enables society to use the power of strategic forecasting for more than corporate and political gain.

'''Evaporated milk''' is evaporated whole [[Cookbook:milk|milk]], typically sold in cans. It varies from 0.5% fat to 8% fat, depending on whether whole milk or skim milk was used to make it.

'''Sweetened condensed milk''' is condensed milk with [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] added. It contains high a percentage of sugar (about 40%), up to 8% fats and 28% milk solids, and thicker. Many recipes that specify condensed milk actually mean ''sweetened'' condensed milk.

Condensed milk can be used to make many [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] and candies.

Condensed soy milk is also available.</text>

== Installation ==
On Windows, run the file &lt;tt&gt;GENtleSetup.exe&lt;/tt&gt;. It will set up GENtle in a directory of your choice, and also prepare for a clean deinstallation.

== Databases ==
There are two types of databases supported by GENtle: File-based (sqlite) and MySQL. By default, a file-based database &lt;tt&gt;local.db&lt;/tt&gt; is set up in the installation directory of GENtle. You can (and should, if access limitations prevent you from working with local.db) create new databases and share them with other users of GENtle in your work group (if you want to).

Database management can be found through the menu &quot;Tools/Manage database&quot;, under the tab &quot;Databases&quot;.
::A quirk: 
::1. Be careful of using the local db for any real development. I strongly advise that you never put anything into local. That db is in the Gentle program's directory and if, say, you need to reinstall GENtle, or you get a new laptop, you may clobber it. And if someone else takes over after that, you can lose it also. I have seen other strange behavior where local.db gets lost, but can't tie it down for a bug report.
::2. GENtle copies blank.db and local.db in [your-username]/AppData/Local/VirtualStore/Program Files (x86)/GENtle It then maintains them. The live local.db is the one in AppData/Local/VirtualStore/Program Files (x86)/GENtle. So, you can delete the one in C:/Program Files (x86)/GENtle and you won't lose it. (This is probably why Magnus did it this way. He was trying to prevent data loss.) But, if you switch computers, this one can get lost. 
::So the first thing you should do for serious work is to make a new db of your own and set it as your default db. And monitor local regularly for stuff accidentally getting into local. The symptoms of a problem are that a project can't find parts of a project.  

=== File-based databases ===
You can add an existing or create a new database via the appropriate buttons. Select the database name and location in the following file dialog.

=== MySQL databases ===
These work similar to the file databases, but require more parameters. Also, a MySQL server has to be installed prior to MySQL database creation. Contact your local system administrator about this.

Creating a new MySQL database might require more MySQL privileges than actually using the created database. Thus, after creation, one might want to remove the database entry via the &quot;Remove&quot; button (the database will continue to exist), and add it again with different MySQL privileges.</text>

      <comment>/* Prepared mustard */  Added link to Dijon mustard</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|Basic foodstuffs]]

'''Mustard''' in cooking can refer to either the spice from seeds of a plant, or '''prepared mustard''', a common condiment.  It is used for its pungent flavor in either application.  '''Mustard greens''', one of the many [[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassicas]] (or cruciform vegetables), contain similarly strong flavor.

== Dry mustard ==
Dry mustard in its seed form can be classified as either ''white mustard'', ''brown mustard'' or ''black mustard''.  Seeds crushed into a fine powder are also readily available in many markets.  Mustard seed is among the world's most ancient of flavorings, found in the remnants of Egyptian and Indian civilizations from centuries ago.

== Prepared mustard==
Prepared mustard can be found in multiple variations around the world, and usually consist of ground seeds combined with vinegar and water, as well as some other ingredients.  The most notable prepared mustards today come from traditions in China, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States.

* '''Chinese hot mustard''' is often little more than the combination of pulverized brown mustard seeds and cold water.  The characteristic sharp, stinging flavor of the mustard comes from a chemical reaction resulting from putting the seed with cold water.

* '''French and English mustards''' typically are among the most potent of the more complex prepared mustards.  As early as the 1700s in France, mustard seeds were ground (with or without their hulls) and combined into a thick sauce, and produced commercially.  [[Cookbook:Dijon_Mustard|''Dijon mustard'']], the best known of the French mustards, uses brown mustard seeds in varying strengths.  It has become common especially in the United States in recent years to combine Dijon mustard with honey for sauces and salad dressings.  ''English mustard'', also popularized in its dry form, most commonly uses a combination of white and brown mustard seeds, and has potency often compared to horseradish.

* '''German mustard''' receives similar preparation techniques, but is often milder due to the addition of sugar.  Many varieties of German mustard, as in some French varieties, are so-called stone-ground mustards, with coarsely ground mustard seeds incorporated into the mixture.  This as well as varying additional spices in the recipe such as cracked peppercorns can give some German mustards a differently strong flavor than those from other sources.  The stone-ground mustards are also similar to ''Creole mustard'' found in Louisiana and other parts of the United States.

* '''Yellow mustard''' first became common in the mid-1800s, using mostly white mustard seeds and given a heightened yellow color from the addition of turmeric.  Yellow mustard is widely used on hamburgers and hot dogs (or frankfurters) especially in the United States, and is a common condiment for other sandwiches and mixed salads (such as potato salad and tuna salad).

== Transformation Processes ==

Transformation processes can be described as some change in behavior which is intended to alter the desired outcome.  Individuals can go through a transformation process that deals with their intellect as well as their overall persona.  Organizations can also go through transformation processes. Usually, organizations will have a change in goal or organizational mission that will trigger for a transformation process to occur, whether it is to have a major down-sizing or to implement new policies and procedures that directly affect the collective behavior of the organization as a whole.  The research involving transformation processes to date explore different models to use for the most efficient processes to take place.  For instance, Creative Dimensions in Management (CDM), a consulting firm, presented corporate transformation processes based on one-on-one mentoring to a succession of UK banking organizations in the late 80s and 90s.  Models drawn from Comprehensive Family Therapy  and Progressive Abreactive Regression (PAR) tries to predict a persons attempt to significantly change their performance, they are likely to follow a zig-zag path to growth, alternatively progressing and regressing as in the following diagram:


[[Image:cdm.gif]]


Concluding the study by CDM suggested that, “''The key to managing these regressions lies in increased self-awareness. As the growth goal increases, awareness and self-consciousness must deepen in order to manage the regressive trends that occur. These trends include moving beyond one's illusions about oneself and one's potential; moving beyond the defenses that protect the self from the anxieties of growth; examining and resolving the ambivalence that prevents a total commitment to achieving one's vision; embracing fears and terrors associated with failure and success including shame and abandonment; and, ultimately, discovering one's will - an energy source that can fuel the activation and achievement of any vision''.”

== Continuous Transformations ==

Another realm often researched is socio-ecological systems which are often described by ''society-environment relations which are relevant for sustainable development within a certain problem area. Problem areas may be the supply of human needs, economic sectors, geographic regions etc.'' Energy, substance flows, technical structures, institutions, and ideas influence the transformation process that is involved in these socio-ecological systems.  It is also discovered that this type of system is continuously undergoing transformations due to its underlined nature. The following chart depicts the study of this system and how it relates to transformation processes:
[[Image:graph2.jpg]]
Further research of this realm suggests, “''The challenge of sustainable transformation is to understand the complex interactions which underlie the dynamics of structural change, to assess and evaluate the impacts of specific paths of transformation, and to shape transformation processes in order bring about desired outcomes'' “

== Sustainable Transformation ==

3 specific features of Sustainable Transformation: 
**1. Uncertainty about system behavior, because of non-predictability of complex interactions underlying transformation processes. 
**2.  Divergent social goals and differing evaluations of the impact of transformation, with social values being endogenous to the transformation process.
**3.   Distribution of control capacities among a broad range of social actors with   specific interests and resources to influence transformation paths.

'''Fiddleheads''', also known as '''fiddle greens''', are the coiled growing tips of ostrich ferns. They are more often available in spring.
[[File:Fiddleheads_Crosses_de_fougère.jpg|thumb|A bucket of fiddleheads]]
The flavor is unique and vegetative, being somewhat like [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] and [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichokes]]. The texture is pleasantly chewy. Fiddleheads are reputed to be a good source of vitamins A and C. Fiddleheads are also rich in vitamin K, important to note for people taking bloodthinners.

Preparation is simple. The ferns should be rinsed and the stem ends trimmed before steaming, simmering or sautéing. They also can be pickled, but should not be eaten raw.
Fiddleheads contain an unknown toxin that causes severe stomach upset bordering on food poisoning. Always blanch, boil, or steam before eating.

Fiddleheads should be eaten soon after purchase, although they may be stored for a few days, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator, if need be.  They can also be stored in water in the fridge for up to a week if you change the water every two days. 

Most of the greens sold as fiddleheads are immature ostrich ferns (''Matteuccia struthiopteris'') of northeastern North America, which are safe for most people to eat. However, if wild-gathered, care should be taken to ensure that the fiddleheads are ostrich ferns.  Cinnamon ferns (''Osmundastrum cinnamomeum'') and interrupted ferns (''Osmunda claytoniana'') are often mistaken for ostrich ferns, though easy to tell apart if one knows what to look for.  Ostrich fiddleheads are not covered with wool and have a groove running up the stem.  Bracken (''Pteridium aquilinum'') is considered carcinogenic.  Fiddleheads must be broken off with the flick of the wrist and never cut, as cutting prevents the plant from regenerating.

In preparation for eating, the fiddleheads must be cleaned of their brown-colored silk, which resembles the inside skin of a roasted peanut, but is not tasty. This is most easily accomplished with the aid of a garden hose, and some sort of screening device. 

Blanching the fiddleheads is a must if they are to be frozen (which the recommended way of storing them, for up to eighteen months) and is also preferable if they are to be eaten immediately. This removes the bitterness from the plant, which can cause stomach upset for some. Blanching is done is by bringing the cleaned fiddleheads just to a boil in a large pot of water, and then immediately rinsing them and disposing of the water. One will notice that the water has turned black. 	

After the rinse, either return them to the pot (with fresh water) to resume cooking, or plunge them in ice cold water to stop the internal cooking process, and then place them in freezer bags, and then into the freezer. 	

Cooked fiddleheads are done when they have lost their crunchiness, but not become soggy. This is ''al dente'' cooking. Served with real butter, and salt, some people also like to add a little cider vinegar. Their subtle flavor interpolates between sweet, mild asparagus and an un-bitter version of cooked baby spinach.

'''Honey Taffy''' – This recipe entails a good workout with the reward of unmistakably honey-flavored candies. This recipe can be completed by a single chef, but is much more fun with the help of friends and family.

==Ingredients==

*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 tablespoons cornstarch
*1 cup liquid [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], any variety
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==

#In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] combine the sugar, salt and cornstarch until uniform.
#Using a wooden or metal spoon, stir in the honey and the water. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and continually stir until all the sugar dissolves.
#Continue to stir the mixture until the mixture begins to boil. Once boiling begins, let the solution cook undisturbed until it reaches 270&amp;deg;F/132&amp;deg;C also known as the [[Cookbook:Cold Water Candy Test#Soft Crack|soft crack stage]]. Add the butter.
#Remove the hot mixture from heat and pour onto a greased, lipped cookie sheet, a greased marble slab, or a silicone mat, such as a [[Cookbook:Silpat|Silpat]].
#When taffy is cool enough to handle with greased cleaned hands, gather the taffy and continually stretch, fold and recombine it until it lightens in color and gains a satiny gloss. This step is best accomplished with a friend. This step requires 10 to 15 minutes of constant pulling.
#Once taffy has been properly pulled, roll into 1/2 inch ropes and cut into 1 inch long pieces with a knife or greased scissors. Once all the taffy is cut, wrap in small squares of waxed paper and twist the ends.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Be extremely careful around the boiling solution, as it gets extremely hot and sticks like tar.
*Use a wooden or metal spoon for this recipe, as most plastic spoons will melt or deform.  A wooden spoon is best because a metal spoon will get very hot in the sugar syrup.
*You can add extra flavoring or coloring to the taffy if you mix it in at the same time as the butter.
*If you don’t like honey, or don’t want to use a lot of it, you can substitute [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]] for equal parts of the missing honey.
*If you want some extra reward for extra effort, try making two batches with different colors and/or flavors at once, and twisting or braiding the taffy ropes before cutting to make interesting combinations.
*If you don't have cornstarch, you can use 1 tsp. of vinegar instead to help prevent recrystallization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people are interested in the field of computer animation.  Some see animations on the web, such as the excellent political satires on [http://jibjab.com jibjab.com], and wonder how they could create their own.  Others with an interest in film wonder if this new field could help their own amateur film-making efforts (even if they don't expect to be able to create The Incredibles on their home PC).

''The field is attractive as a hobby to many creative amateurs, however it can quickly become discouraging due to the relative scarcity of introductory material, and the steep learning curve.  This wikibook is intended to act as a gathering point for information on the subject currently scattered around wikipedia.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Computer Generated Imagery ==

'''Computer-generated imagery''' ('''CGI''') is the application of the field of computer graphics (or more specifically 3D computer graphics) to special effects. CGI is used in movies, television programs and commercials, and in printed media. Real-time computer graphics, such as those in video games, are rarely referred to as CGI.

CGI is used because it is often cheaper than physical methods, such as constructing elaborate miniatures for effects shots or hiring a great deal of extras for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other method. It can also allow a single artist to produce content without the use of actors or other contributors to the project.

2D CGI was first used in movies in 1973's Westworld, though the first use of 3D imagery was in its sequel, Futureworld (1976), which featured a computer-generated hand and face created by then University of Utah graduate students Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke. The first two films to make heavy investments in CGI, Tron (1982) and The Last Starfighter (1984), were commercial failures, causing most directors to relegate CGI to images that were supposed to look like they were created by a computer. Photorealistic CGI did not win over the motion picture industry until 1989, when The Abyss won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. Industrial Light and Magic produced photorealistic CGI visual effects, including a seawater creature lovingly dubbed the water weenie, for the film.

2D CGI increasingly appeared in &quot;traditional&quot; animated films, where it supplemented the use of hand-illustrated cels. Its uses ranged from digital tweening motion between frames, to eye-catching quasi-3D effects such as the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast.

In 1995, the first fully computer-generated feature film, Pixar's Toy Story, was a resounding commercial success. Additional digital animation studios such as Blue Sky Studios (Fox) and Pacific Data Images (Dreamworks SKG) went into production, and existing animation companies such as Disney began to make a transition from traditional animation to CGI.

Between 1995 and 2005 the average effects budget for a wide-release feature film skyrocketed from $5 million to $40 million. According to one studio executive, as of 2005, more than half of feature films have significant effects.

In the early 2000s, computer-generated imagery became the dominant form of special effects. The technology progressed to the point that it became possible to include virtual stunt doubles that were nearly indistinguishable from the actors they replaced. Computer-generated extras also became used extensively in crowd scenes. The timeline of CGI in movies shows a detailed list of pioneering uses of computer-generated imagery in film and television.

CGI for films is usually rendered at about 1.4–6 megapixels. Toy Story, for example, was rendered at 1536 × 922. The time to render one frame is typically around 2–3 hours, with ten times that for the most complex scenes. This time hasn't changed much in the last decade, as image quality progressed at the same rate as improvements in hardware.

Developments in CGI technologies are reported each year at SIGGRAPH, an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, attended each year by tens of thousands of computer professionals.

Developers of computer games and 3D video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real-time as is possible for CGI films and animation. With the rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality, artists began to use game engines to render non-interactive movies. This art form is called machinima.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Learning Management Systems in the Healthcare Environment==
Education in the [[w:Healthcare|healthcare]] environment is essential to produce quality well-trained [[w:Employee#Employee|employees]]. In the past, classroom training in a face-to-face environment was the main way that employees were provided their initial and ongoing training needed to perform their job responsibilities. This required the employees to be away from their work environment, whether that be providing [[w:Patient|patient]] care or working in an administrative or clerical position, for a period of time. This meant that their duties were either not being done during that time or another employee would have to pick up the additional responsibilities. All of this causes an increase in costs for the corporation as well as potential safety issues if the employee is providing patient care. A [[w:Learning management system|learning management system]] can help alleviate some of the problems that hospitals face in the traditional classroom training environment. 

==Regulatory Agency Requirements==
Implementing a learning management system, while initially can be a costly investment, over time can prove to be a well spent investment. More and more [[w:Hospital|hospitals]] are required to provide mandatory yearly education to their employees due to regulatory agency requirements. Examples of some of the regulatory agencies that put demands on healthcare include, but are not limited to:

Regulatory Agencies:
*[[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]
*[http://www.jointcommission.org/ The Joint Commission
*[http://www.mpro.org/ MPRO]

CMS, Centers for [[w:Medicare (United_States)|Medicare]] and Medicaid Services is a federally funded program that is concerned, like most other regulatory agencies with the quality of healthcare being provided to the beneficiaries of medicare and medicaid. They are involved in many programs that look at quality and confidentiality such as  
[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa/ HIPPA] , the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is one example of a regulation mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. HIPPA is related to insurance coverage for individuals as well as confidentiality compliance that must be followed by hospitals as well as many other healthcare businesses such as physician offices, insurance companies, etc. Hospitals must provide education to their employees on how to handle electronically printed medical information about patients.

Another regulatory agency that puts demands on hospitals as far as educating their employees is The Joint Commission.  [http://www.jointcommission.org/ The Joint Commission].
JCAHO provides accreditation to healthcare facilities following a site visit and review of the institution. The Joint Commission is concerned with the care provided to patients. A current initiative of the Joint Commission is patient safety. A LMS can provide education about patient safety, initiatives the hospital is instituting to assist in patient safety and what healthcare providers can do to provide safe care to their patients.

[http://www.mpro.org/ MPRO] is a state of [[w:Michigan|Michigan]] based organization that looks at healthcare quality and ways for healthcare institutions to improve care to their patients. Based on their reviews of a hospitals services they may offer suggestions for ways to improve processes that are used in the healthcare environment. A LMS is a way to provide education to healthcare providers on how to utilize the information and suggestions made by MPRO to improve the delivery of care to their patients.

==Continuing Education Requirements==
According to [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/home.asp ACGME's],Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education website; ACGME “is a private, non-profit council that evaluates and accredits medical residency programs in the United States. The mission of the ACGME is to improve the quality of health care in the United States by ensuring and improving the quality of graduate medical education for physicians in training.” [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/newsRoom/newsRm_acGlance.asp Reference citation]
[[w:Medical resident|Medical residents]] are required to obtain a certain amount of hours worked in a teaching hospital as well as continuing medical education requirements.
[[w:Physician|Physicians]] are also required to obtain continuing medical education credits every three years while they are in practice, in order to maintain their licensure.  Each state varies as to what those requirements are. [[w:Registered_Nurse|Registered nurses]] are also required to obtain continuing education contact hours every two years to maintain their license.  This number also varies by state and may have specific requirements as to the type or content of contact hours that must be obtained.  A learning management system can be used to offer courses to both physicians and nurses as well as any other category of staff that require continuing education for licensure.  The LMS can also be used to track whether or not staff have the met licensure requirements

==Benefits for a Healthcare Environment ==
For example, a large teaching hospital located in a suburb of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit Detroit]is a 1,061 bed hospital that has approximately 13,000 employees. Based on the type of employee, there are required yearly educational programs/material that must be mastered. Many of these requirements are mandated by the outside regulatory agencies described above.  Some examples of the courses are:
*Patient Confidentiality
*Electrical Safety
*Fire Safety
*Corporate Compliance
*Emergency Management

In order for a hospital of this size to maintain records of completion and mastery of the required course/information, a LMS is an invaluable tool. It provides the hospital with an easy way to track all employee records and provide the regulatory agencies with proof of compliance.


Benefits also include: 
*Reduction of scheduling personnel to attend training programs.
*Delivery of training anytime – day or night.
*Access to training at home or on the job.
*Consistent content delivery.
*Opportunities for the EMS system to provide updated information to EMS practitioners.

''Simple and easy to use.''
The LMS has the capability to track overall user progress, evaluate program content, score tests, and create certificates.  In addition to the course content there can be: 
*An information library
*Course tests
*Program content surveys

When sugar syrup is cooked, water boils away resulting in a high temperature sugar concentrate. Hence, as the temperature raises so does the concentration of sugar within the solution. The nifty thing about cooking sugar is that the highest temperature it reaches can tell you a little something about how it will turn out once it cools down to room temperature.
Often it is practical to use a [[Cookbook:Candy Thermometer|candy thermometer]] how ever using the cold water test can be more fun (and dangerous). Note that the following temperatures are listed at sea level, as they are listed in most cookbooks, because of this actually using the cold water test can be a more reliable gage when making candy.
Each test is completed by dropping a dollop of the hot candy solution in cold water (not room temperature), and then extracting the candy formed. Be sure to allow for a moment for the candy to cool before handling it to avoid getting burnt.

==Thread==
230&amp;deg;F-235&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 80%&lt;br&gt;
At this point there is a lot of water left in the syrup. When cooled in water it will create a liquid thread than cannot be easily collected. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is proper for making syrup such as [[Cookbook:Chocolate Syrup|Chocolate Syrup]] but is not technically a candy.

==Soft Ball==
235&amp;deg;F-240&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 85%&lt;br&gt; 
At this point the syrup dropped in to cold water can be formed in to a soft and flexible ball. At this point the candy cannot easily support itself and will begin to run if left out. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is proper for making items such as [[Cookbook:Fudge|Fudge]].

==Firm Ball==
245&amp;deg;F-250&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 87%&lt;br&gt;
A little syrup at this temperature dropped in to a cold water bath will create a firm chewy ball that can support its own weight and will remain chewy. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is appropriate for making candies such as [[Cookbook:Caramel|Caramel]], but please note this in not the same thing as [[Cookbook:Caramelizing|Caramelizing]].

==Hard Ball==
250&amp;deg;F-255&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 92%&lt;br&gt;  
At this stage the syrup solution will form thick ropy threads when quenched in cooled water. If a large enough quantity is cooled it will form a hard ball with little moisture. &lt;br&gt; This temperature is best suited for recipes such as [[Cookbook:Rock Candy|Rock Candy]] or 

==Soft Crack==
270&amp;deg;F-290&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 95%&lt;br&gt; 
When the solution reaches this stage the bubbles will become obviously smaller and more concentrated. The candy at this stage has a low moisture point and will create small flexible threads when dropped in the cold water. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is optimal for recipes such as [[Cookbook:Honey Taffy|Honey Taffy]] or  [[Cookbook:Salt Water Taffy|Salt Water Taffy]].

==Hard Crack==
300&amp;deg;F-310&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 99%&lt;br&gt;  
At this point the moisture levels are nearly non-existent, it is also the highest recipe that will be used in a standard candy recipe, after this point you enter the region of [[Cookbook:Caramelizing|caramelizing]]. A small amount of syrup, when dropped in to cold water, will become brittle threads and easily break when bent or dropped. &lt;br&gt;
This final stage is used for creating [[Cookbook:Toffee|Toffee]] and [[Cookbook:Hard Candy|Hard Candy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Making animation on a computer can be relatively cheap, horrendously expensive, or anywhere in between.  Your requirements will depend on what exactly you want to do (more on the different types of animation in chapter 4), but it's safe to say most hobbyists can get involved with minimal outlay.

== Hardware  ==

Most of the equipment here you will already have, or can pick up cheaply.  Unless you plan to make broadcast quality animation, don't worry about going for the cheaper models as the differences at the lower end of the market are negligible.

'''A PC'''

For any sort of graphics work, the faster your PC's processor the better.  Also, the more memory it has in terms of RAM and hard-drive space the better.  Any computer bought within the last year or two should be able to handle the majority of animation tasks comfortably however.

If you have money to burn, you might want to consider increasing the RAM in your PC to its maximum amount as this will greatly enhance your user experience when working with large files.  Another upgrade which is always worthwhile if you do a lot of graphics work is a bigger hard-drive as the files you generate build up quickly.

For certain types of animation such as machinima or 3d, you may want to consider upgrading your graphics card to the best you can afford.  For most animation purposes, any relatively modern graphics card will do, there is no need to go for the staggeringly expensive model on the bleeding edge.

'''A Digital Camera'''

An absolute essential.  Probably the easiest way to get a source image to modify without having to worry about copyright implications.

A digital camera, as opposed to a film or video camera, uses an electronic sensor to transform images (or video) into electronic data. Modern digital cameras are typically multifunctional and the same device can take photographs, video, and/or sound.

In 2005, digital cameras are starting to push traditional film cameras out of many markets. Shrinking device sizes have recently allowed miniaturized digital cameras to be included in multifunctional devices, such as cell phones and PDAs.  There is no particular need to go for the most expensive model, but it does not hurt to get the best resolution you can afford.

{{Wikipedia|Digital camera}}


'''A Scanner'''

Not essential, unless you have a lot of images on paper you would like to work with on your PC.  A scanner is a device which reads in an image and converts it to electronic data, and in appearance it is usually a flat panel similar to the top of a photocopier.

Those who prefer to sketch with pen and paper can find that a scanner is a useful addition to their workstation, enabling them to transfer their doodles and rough sketches to the PC for processing.  Only those who need to scan intricately detailed or overlarge pieces of work should consider buying an expensive model.

{{Wikipedia|Image scanner}}

'''A Graphics Tablet'''

A graphics tablet (or digitizing tablet) is a computer peripheral device that allows for a relatively simple method of inputting hand-drawn graphics or art into a computer in real time. They typically consist of a large flat surface for drawing on, and an attached &quot;stylus&quot; for drawing on the surface, originally as a part of the electronics, but later simply to provide an accurate but smooth &quot;point&quot;.

Graphics tablets sometimes take a little bit of getting used to, but the fact that they are usually more sensitive and intuitive than a mouse means most serious electronic artists swear by them.  Although these can be picked up pretty cheaply, it is best only using the budget models to try out tablets for the first time, and to quickly upgrade if you plan to be using one often.

{{Wikipedia|Digitizing tablet}}

'''Sound Hardware'''

Most animations require some sort of soundtrack, and you may need to create some of the sounds yourself.  Sounds are input and output from a sound card or sound chip (which may be part of your PC's motherboard, or a separate card), and it is likely that the sound card which came with your computer will be suitable for your purposes.

The sound card will have an input for a microphone, a line-in, and a joypad or MIDI keyboard.  A microphone is a handy thing to have for recording sound effects and voice tracks, but the budget models should be sufficient for this.  The line in socket is used to record audio from an external device such as an ipod or cassette deck and requires a cable with a headphone jack at either end to use.

A MIDI keyboard can be useful if you are at-all musical and capable of creating your own music tracks.  These are basically mini piano-style keyboards that interface with your PC and use the PC's software to generate sound, which is then output through the PC's speakers.  

{{Wikipedia|Sound card}}
{{Wikipedia|MIDI}}

== Software ==

This list is in no way intended to be exhaustive, and splits the required software into a few broad categories of which a few representative examples are given.  Where possible, any free or Open Source Software(OSS) available is highlighted.

'''Image Manipulation Software'''

This is what you use to transform the images you work with, moulding them to fit the requirements of your animation, and modifying them to create the key elements.  Any decent application will allow you to play with the size, colouring, and content of your images.  It will allow you to splice them together into montages, to split them into their component parts, and much, much more.  Whichever piece of software you use, taking the time to learn how to use it well will pay dividends in terms of the time it takes you to make an animation, and the animation's quality when it's done.

The market leader and industry standard is [[w:Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]], which can be an expensive purchase for a beginner.  There are cheaper alternatives such as Paint Shop Pro available, and a reduced price version of Photoshop (with consequently reduced functionality) called Photoshop Elements is also on the market.

The leading OSS for image manipulation is The GIMP, an excellent and powerful alternative to commercial equivalents.  The only problem with the GIMP is its non-standard interface which may prove daunting to beginners.

'''Animation Software'''

The leading software in 2D computer animation is Adobe Flash. This is program is commonly used to create animations for the Internet in SWF format, also known as &quot;flash cartoons&quot; or &quot;flashtoons.&quot; It also has its own built-in programming language called Actionscript that can be applied to its animations.

'''3D Animation'''

For those looking to start in CG animation, the leading opensource alternative is [[w:Blender|Blender]], frequently updated, and has an excellent user base to help newbies and pros alike. No program can be more highly recommended than Blender 3d. There are many [[Blender|Wikibooks on Blender]].

There are many types of 3D animation software available. Some, like Maya, [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13567410 3D Studio Max], and Cinema4D, are available from various sources for a commercial-size price. Maya, for example, can cost thousands for the higher-end versions - but it may be worth the money, as many professional CG companies use it.

'''Sound and Music Software'''

== Brothers or both? ==

The last sentence of the article says that 'brother cheetahs will sometimes form partnerships...' does this mean that only males form alliances or does it mean siblings in general?

:[[User:Hdavis|Hdavis]]

:Only males form alliances, and these alliances are usually brothers.  Females are solitary except while breeding or raising offspring.  A rather intersting story surfaced not long ago, when an adult male who was obviously having great difficulty getting prey in a very lean time came up to an adult female who was feeding.  She at first tried to shoo him off but later accepted his &quot;begging&quot; and allowed him to eat with her.  Later it was established that the male was one of her sons from a previous litter.  Apparently he still loved his mother, and she still harbored a reluctant affection for him.  The whole concept of &quot;solitary&quot; cats is more often than not misunderstood.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 18:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

== How do cheetahs raise their young? ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Females give birth to three to five cubs at a time. Many cubs are killed by a lack of food or their natural enemies (lions and hyenas).  An old African legend says the tear stain marks on the cheetah's face are from the mother weeping for her lost cubs.  The mother cheetah must train the young cubs to hunt food for themselves so they can survive on their own. The cubs leave their mother about one or two years later, and will usually live in groups of two or three while reaching adulthood.  Female cheetahs eventually go their separate ways, but brother cheetahs usually form lifelong partnerships and share in the hunt to survive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I removed this raising young section (quote above for cheetahs) for all of the cats and combined them to form a single page to talk about raising young in cats. In general, much of the subject material was being repeated for each species of cat. I understand that not all cats can be generalized, however, I think that the &quot;exceptions&quot; to the general topic can have the information presented shortly, without the need to devote a whole section of the article to raising young, such as in the facts box. This'll also keep the pages consistent with each other. My two cents. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 05:24, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

== since when is 274 metres almost a mile ==

Needs correcting. 2 facts to include./

Other big cats chase only a few hundred meters, the cheetah chases 3.4 miles (5500 meters) at an average speed of 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour).

The top speed, 71 miles per hour (114 kilometers per hour), can usually be maintained for only 200-300 yards (274 meters).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Essential oil|Essential oils]] are strongly scented oils that are created through the distillation of plant materials. Most commonly derived from the flowers, leaves or stems of a plant, they may also be derived from fruit or the skin of a fruit. 
Many of these oils have common uses in aroma theory and alternative medicine. Beekeepers however, also may have a used for a select few of these common oils&lt;br&gt;
Essential oils can often be found in health food stores or aromatherapy shops, the price may be high, but keep in mind that a little oil will go a long way.

==Commonly Used Oils==
There exist a wider variety of essential oils. In general, beekeepers are only interested in a few of them. The following is a list of some of the more common oils that may concern a beekeeper.

;Banana:Though it has been unconfirmed, reports state that banana oil seems to closely mimic the [[Beekeeping/Pheromone#Alarm|alarm pheromone]] of honeybees. Because of this it is advised against using banana oil, or other strong banana scented products near or around hives. It is unclear wheatear bananas can be safely eaten near honey bees, but it is likely that no adverse result would be seen.

;Lemon Grass:[[w:Lemongrass|Lemongrass]] works conveniently as well as the pheromone created by the honeybee's [[Beekeeping/Pheromone#Nasonov|nasonov]] gland, also known as attractant pheromone. Because of this lemon grass oil can be used as a lure when [[Beekeeping/Trapping Swarms|trapping swarms]] or attempting to draw the attention of hived bees. Be warned, however, that lemon grass oil can cause a [[Beekeeping/Robbing Behavior|robbing behavior]] if it is used within or on a weak hive.

;Peppermint:[[w:Peppermint|Peppermint]] oil is used as a general-purpose pheromone masking scent. It does not apparently mimic any known bee pheromones and is simply used to mask others. In theory any other strong scented essential oil would work the same.

;Spearmint:[[w:Spearmint|Spearmint]] oil is often used in conjunction with [[#Lemon Grass|lemon grass oil]] during feeding to improve hive health and work as a recruiting scent. 

;Spearmint and Lemon Grass:[[#Spearmint|Spearmint oil]] and [[#Lemon Grass|lemon grass oil]] are two essential oils that are commonly used in conjunction to complete many tasks with bees. A simple [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#General Purpose Essential Oil Mixture| general purpose essential oil mixture]] can be used for many things, including avoiding the reliance on smoke when opening hives.

;Tea Tree:[[w:Tea tree|Tea Tree]] oil is often used in [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Grease Patty|grease patties]] for control of mites. It seems as if Tea Tree oil can be interchanged with [[#Wintergreen|wintergreen]] oil with no loss of effectiveness.

;Wintergreen:[[w:Wintergreen|Wintergreen]] oil is often used in [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Grease Patty|grease patties]] for control of mites. It seems as if Tea Tree oil can be interchanged with [[#Wintergreen|wintergreen]] oil with no loss of effectiveness.

==Essential Oil Therapy Versus Mites==
===Varroa Mites===
Essential oils, in regards to mite control, have two apparent modes of operation, primarily, direct toxicity. In the case of [[Beekeeping/Parasites#Varroa Mites|varroa mites]], once a mite comes in to direct contact with an essential oils such as [[#Wintergreen|wintergreen]] or [[#Tea Tree|tea tree]] oil mixed into a [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Grease Patty|grease patty]] they are usually killed within a few minutes. This however, requires that the infected bee actually contact the grease patty. Due to this contact requirement, direct toxicity cannot eliminate mites, only aid in the control of mite levels. Secondly, it appears mite reproduction can be impaired when bees are fed a [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#Sugar Syrup| syrup]] containing essential oils. Essential oils are passed from feeding bees to other bees and larva through trophalaxis. Essential oils thereby pass to the brood and poison any female Varroa that attempt to parasitically feed on the larva.

===Tracheal Mites===
Similarly, essential oils appear to have an impact on the breeding and control of [[Beekeeping/Parasites#Tracheal Mites|tracheal mites]], however the effects of tracheal mites are difficult to observe and the mechanism that causes the control is in debate. It appears that the best therapy, in regards to tracheal mites and essential oils, is the usage of grease patties.

===Treatment===
It is recommended that that grease patties containing essential oils, and other medicaments as desired, are kept on the hives throughout the winter and any season when honey collection for human consumption is not taking place. Grease patties not containing any essential oils or medication should be kept on hives throughout the rest of the year. During times of the year that temperatures allow for flight, and honey is not to being collected for human consumption, colonies should be treated with syrup containing essential oils.

[[Image:The Blue Marble.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Planet earth from space]]

In the previous chapter on [[../Environmental_Response|environmental response]], we considered the various ways that individual organisms respond to the physical, chemical, and/or biological stimuli in their environment.  In this chapter, we will go deeper into the interactions between the biotic and the abiotic elements of the biosphere, focusing on the nonliving components. To begin to understand the physical &quot;home&quot; of our '''biosphere''', we first have to consider the physics of planet formation. From all we know about life in the universe, only planets can possibly offer conditions suitable for life. And indeed, since all life we know of occurs on just one planet, we need to develop an understanding of what is special or unique about our home planet.  How is the earth constituted; what is the nature of this &quot;stage&quot; upon which life developed and upon which life continues to play out. Presently, the &quot;ecology&quot; of other planets, if such a thing exists, is a subject of study within the science of '''exobiology'''.

Nutrients move through the ecosystem in biogeochemical cycles. A biogeochemical cycle is a circuit/pathway by which a chemical element moves through the biotic and the abiotic factors of an ecosystem. It is inclusive of the biotic factors, or living organisms, rocks, air, water, and chemicals.  The elements that are moving through the biotic or abiotic factors may be recycled, or they may be accumulated in a place called a '''sink/reservoir''' where they are held for a long period of time.  The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called '''residence'''.

All of the chemical elements in an organism are part of the biogeochemical cycle.  The chemicals travel not only through the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem, but they also travel through an organism.  The abiotic factors of an ecosystem include: (1) water (hydrosphere), (2) land (lithosphere), and (3) air (atmosphere).  All of the living factors that are found on Earth make up the biosphere.

===Nutrient Cycle Levels===
[[Image:Cellularrespiration.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Respiration can be both aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) and anaerobic (with out oxygen).]]
Nutrient cycles are broken up into three levels. There are '''global nutrient cycles''', which occur when ecosystems become linked on a global scale. This is now known as an ''Ecosphere''. On a smaller scale, there are '''local nutrient cycles'''. These cycles consist of the cycling that occurs in just one ecosystem. The smallest level includes '''common nutrient budgets and fluxes'''; some examples of this are carbon, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and other trace elements. All of these cycles can be linked so that a community can remain at equilibrium. All of these cycles are driven by microbes. Microbes contain 350-550 giga tons of the worlds carbon. They also contain 85-130 giga tons of nitrogen, along with 9-14 giga tons of phosphorus. Nitrogen is only fixed by bacteria and archea, and they fix 85% of the 15 giga tons of nitrogen every year.  Cyanobacteria are responsible for fixing 50% of the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Ecosphere.  There are also huge reserves of carbon locked up in rocks. Rocks contain 81 million gig tons of carbon, which is in the form of calcium carbonate (CaCo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), commonly called limestone. 

The processes that make up these cycles can be divided into two groups. The first group of processes all have an '''aerobic component'''. Through respiration, organic material can be converted into carbon dioxide. Respiration is done by animals, plants, and microbes. A second aerobic process is carbon fixation. This is the reverse of respiration where carbon dioxide is converted into organic material. The second group of processes are '''anaerobic processes'''. The first anaerobic process is fermentation. This is another way that organic material can be converted into carbon dioxide. Bacteria and fungi carry out this process when deprived of oxygen.  A second form of an anaerobic process is carbon fixation. The only organisms that fix carbon anaerobically are archea. The last anaerobic process is methanogenesis.  This process takes carbon dioxide and converts it into methane. This process is also only done by archea, but does not account for all methane because some methane can be made aerobically. 

[[Image:Nutrient-cycle_hg.png|thumb|450px|left|The Nutrient Cycle]]

There are two main types of systems on Earth, a closed system and an open system. A '''closed system''' occurs when the chemicals or elements used in an ecosystem are recycled instead of being lost. An '''open system''' occurs when the sun provides Earth with energy in the form of light which is usually used and then lost in the form of heat as it travels through the various trophic levels on Earth.

Although the biogeochemical cycles are complex and differ between the needs of nutrients by heterotrophs and autotrophs, there are three shared components of nutrient cycles: inputs, internal cycling, and outputs. Precipitation is one form of input, which brings appreciable quantities of nutrients into a cycle (Patterson, 1975). Microbes recycling dead organic material back into the system to be reused is a form of internal cycling. The export of nutrients must be offset by the input of nutrients into a system if there is to be no net loss. Carbon is exported from a cycle in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via respiration of all living organisms.

The most important biogeochemical cycles are the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, oxygen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and the water cycle.  The biogeochemical cycles always have a state of equilibrium.  The state of equilibrium occurs when there is a balance in the cycling of the elements between compartments.  Ecologists may also be interested in the sulfur cycle, the nutrient cycle, and the hydrogen cycle; however, ecologists are more interested in studying the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and water cycles.

The term biogeochemical gets its name from the previous cycles listed above (abiotiv factors).  The prefix ''Bio'' refers to the biosphere.  ''Geo'' refers to the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.  Chemical refers to the various chemicals that go through/travel through the biogeochemical cycles.

== Biogeochemical Cycles ==
[[Image:AYool GLODAP del pH.png|thumb|250px|left|global changes in earth's atmosphere]]
A '''biogeochemical cycle''' or inorganic-organic cycle is a circulating or repeatable pathway by which either a chemical element or a molecule moves through both biotic (&quot;bio-&quot;) and abiotic (&quot;geo-&quot;) compartments of an ecosystem. In effect, an element is chemically recycled, although in some cycles there may be places (called &quot;sinks&quot;) where the element accumulates and is held for a long period of time. In considering a specific biogeochemical cycle, we focus on a particular element and how that element participates in chemical reactions, moving between various molecular configurations. Of the 90-odd elements known to occur in nature, some 30 or 40 are thought to be required by living organisms (Odum, 1959). We will be considering only a few of these, mainly those utilized in fairly large quantities by living organisms. The principal elements of life are '''carbon''', '''hydrogen''', '''oxygen''', and '''nitrogen'''. However, a number of others are certainly important to understand as well, notably '''phosphorus''' and '''sulfur'''. Some &quot;non-essential&quot; elements participate in biogeochemical cycles, entering organism tissues because of chemical similarity to essential elements. For example, strontium can behave like calcium in the body.

=== Hydrologic Cycle (Water Cycle) ===

A very significant molecule (on planet Earth) that cycles through ecosystems is the water molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), for the reason that life is so dependent on water as the medium of chemical reactions within cells. While it generally is the case that we discuss the water cycle in terms of the various states of water, at least some water molecules are taken up by plants and split apart (photolysed) into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen; the latter is released into the atmosphere as molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Thus, by virtue of photosynthesizing organisms (''photoautotrophs''), the water cycle is an important part of both the oxygen and the hydrogen cycles. Note that hydrogen ends up as part of an organic molecule, and therefore a participant in the carbon cycle.

The majority of water in the water cycle is found within the oceans and the polar ice caps, although water is present in the bodies of organisms, in freshwater lakes and rivers, frozen in glaciers, and in the ground as groundwater. Water moves more or less freely between these storage reservoirs: by evaporation, by precipitation, and by runoff from the land. 

The sedimentation cycle is an extension of the hydrological cycle. The water carries material from the land to the ocean, where they are added as sediments. The sediment cycle includes the physical and chemical erosion, nutrient transport, and sediment formation from water flows. The sediment formed from water flows is mostly responsible for the buildup of sediments at the bottom of the ocean. The sediment cycle is tied in with the flow of six important elements, which are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. These elements also known as macroelements make up 95 % of all living things. The balancing of these molecules is required to sustain life. These elements have to be recycled for life to continuously regenerate.

===Carbon Cycle===

[[Image:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Carbon is being released into the atmosphere.]]
Carbon is required for the building of all organic compounds. Carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is obtained from the atmosphere and transformed into a usable organic form by organisms. The reservoirs for the carbon cycle are the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide exists as a free gas, fossil organic deposits (such as oil and coal), and durable organic materials like cellulose. Mineral carbonates, such as limestone, are a significant geological sink for carbon. During the process of carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is taken up from the atmospheric reservoir (or from biocarbonates dissolved in water) by plants, photosynthetic bacteria, and algae and is &quot;fixed&quot; into organic substances. Animals obtain their requirements for carbon (as carbon-based molecules) by eating plants or other animals. For the biological links, the carbon cycle comes full cycle when carbon is released by either plants and animals as they respire or after life as they decompose. Organisms respire carbon dioxide as a waste product from the breakdown of organic molecules as their cells derive energy from oxidizing the molecules containing &quot;fixed&quot; carbon.  The burning of organic material such as wood or fuels also results in the release of carbon dioxide from organic carbon.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a trace gas and has huge effects on Earth’s heat balance by absorbing infrared radiation. During the growing season or summer, there is a decrease in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because increased sunlight and temperature helps plants increase their carbon dioxide uptake and growth. In the winter time, more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enters the atmosphere than can be removed by plants. This happens because plant respirations and the death of plants happens faster than photosynthesis. [[http://essp.csumb.edu/esse/climate/climatebiogeo.html| Life and Biogeochemical Cycles ]]

===Carbon Cycling Experiments===

The impact of land-cover and land-use change on global carbon cycle has been the focus of various studies. The Brazilian Legal Amazon has been an area of particular interest because of rapid forest clearing. In determining such an impact, models are often developed and used. In a study focusing on the net carbon flux caused by deforestation and forest re-growth over the period of 1970-1998, a processed-based model of forest growth, carbon cycling, and land-cover dynamics was developed. This model was named CARLUC (for CARbon and Land-Use Change). This model, in particular, was used to estimate the size of terrestrial carbon pools in terra firme (unflooded) across the Brazilian Legal Amazon and the net flux of carbon resulting from forest disturbance and forest recovery from disturbance {{ref|Hirsh 2004}}.    

As previously mentioned, carbon cycling is driven by both abiotic and biotc factors. Net carbon fluxes can be partitioned into assimilatory and respiratory components. The complex interplay between assimilatory and respiratory sources and their responsiveness to abiotic changes such as drought and temperature are poorly understood. In a recent study, net carbon partitioning was used to disentangle abiotic and biotic drivers of all component influencing the overall sink strength of a Mediterranean ecosystem during a rapid spring to summer transition (between May and June of 2006). It was ultimately determined that decreasing soil water availability rather than increasing air temperature largely affected both assimilation and respiration fluxes of understory plants and in consequence ecosystem respiration and soil respiration {{ref|Unger 2009}}.

===Nitrogen Cycle===
Nitrogen is required for the manufacturing of all amino acids and nucleic acids; however, the average organism can not use atmospheric nitrogen for these tasks and as a result is dependent on the nitrogen cycle as a source for its usable nitrogen. The nitrogen cycle begins with nitrogen stored in the atmosphere as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or nitrogen stored in the soil as ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), or nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen is assimilated into living organisms through three stages: nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and plant metabolism. Nitrogen fixation is a process which occurs in prokaryotes in which N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted to (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Atmospheric nitrogen can also undergo nitrogen fixation by lighting and UV radiation and become NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Following nitrogen fixation, nitrification occurs. During nitrification, ammonia is converted into nitrite, and nitrite is converted into nitrate. Nitrification occurs in various bacteria. In the final stage, plants absorb ammonia and nitrate and incorporate it into their metabolic pathways. Once the nitrogen has entered the plant metabolic pathway, it may be transferred to animals when the plant is eaten. Nitrogen is released back into the cycle when denitrifying bacteria convert NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; into N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process of denitrification, when detrivorous bacteria convert organic compounds back into ammonia in the process of ammonification, or when animals excrete ammonia, urea, or uric acid.

A lot of environmental problems are caused by the disruption of the nitrogen cycle by human activity some of the problems caused range from the production of troposperic (lower atmospheric) smog to the perturbation of stratospheric ozone and contamination of ground water. An example of one of the problems caused is the formation of greenhouse gas. Like carbon dioxide and water vapor greenhouse gas traps heat near the earth’s surface and destroys the stratospheric ozone. Once that occurs nitrous oxide in the earth’s atmosphere is broken down by UV light into nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide. These two products can reduce the ozone. Nitrogen oxides can be changed back into nitrates and nitrite compounds and recycled back into the earth’s surface.[[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/102/ecosystem.html| Environmental Biology - Ecosystems ]]  

===Global Carbon Cycle===

Carbon is continuously cycled between the oceans, land, and the atmosphere. The atmospheric carbon is primarily carbon dioxide. Carbon, on land, occurs primarily in living biota and decaying organic matter. Dissolved carbon dioxide and small organisms like plankton that store carbon dioxide are major sources in the ocean. Carbon is measured in Gigatons, with the deep ocean containing almost 40,000 Gt, compared to about 2,000 Gt on land and 750 Gt in the atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide, a known &quot;greenhouse gas&quot;, traps some of the radiation in the atmosphere that would be lost in space. This causes the atmosphere to be warmer than it would naturally be. Since pre-industrial times man-made emissions have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 30%. The increase in carbon dioxide causing global warming is important for us to understand so we can predict future implications concerning our planet.

Average global temperatures have increased this past century and are predicted to increase even more in the next century. In a study done by Parmesan ''etal'', the distribution and population dynamics of several species of butterflies were monitored in response to the increased temperatures. Migratory patterns of each species were observed and compared to previous patterns of distribution. The butterflies showed a northern shift which is thought to be a response to increased temperatures. Parmesan ''etal'' concluded that the current and future climate warming may be a big factor in shifting species distributions {{ref|Parmesan 199}}.

===Phosphorus, Iron, and Trace Mineral cycles===
The Phosphorus cycle is one of the slowest biogeochemical cycle.  It does not stay in the atmosphere, because it is normally in a liquid state at room temperature.  Phorsphorus mainly cycles through water, soil, and sediments.  The little phosphorus in the atmosphere is carried by dust particles and such.  Phosphate is most often in the form of phosphate salts, which is released from weathered rock and dissolved in ground water where plants take it up.  Phosphorus is a limiting factor for plants on land and in water, including the ocean because there is so little of it and it is not very soluble in water.  The cycle does speed up a little bit as it cycles through plants and animals.  When the plants and animals die and decay the phosphorus is returned to the soil and sediments and eventually locked back in the rock.

The iron cycle is similar to every other cycle.  It is, however, much more abundant than phosphorus.  One additional way iron gets cycled, besides rock weathering, is when a volcano erupts and sends an iron rich dust into the atmosphere and eventually spreading it in soil and water.

Other trace minerals, such as, zinc, copper, and manganese, were once thought to be just as abundant as nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen.  Their depletion is thought to be from water erosion of the soil and over cropping of land, they aren't able to replenish themselves as fast. To learn more about all the trace minerals essential to life visit:[http://www.inspiredliving.com/health/a~traceminerals.htm| Nutrients - Trace Minerals]

=== &quot;Perfect&quot; Cycles ===
Odum (1959) describes what are called more or less &quot;perfect&quot; cycles: biogeochemical cycles that involve equilibrium states. That is, there exists in nature a balance in the cycling of the element between various compartments, with the element or material moving into abiotic compartments about as fast as it moves into biotic compartments. Certain ecosystems may experience &quot;shortages&quot;, but overall a balance exists on a global scale.

II. Deserts are characterized by their limited precipitation.  Deserts have a brief rainy season which on average produces less than 30 cm rainfall per year. Deserts are mainly located at 30 degrees North and South latitude because of its dry air resulting from the Hadley cell (please read interlink below on a Hadley cell), which stretches between the equator and 20 to 35 degrees North and South latitude.  

Deserts have the capacity to be very productive climates because they are in a high energy input area of the round earth (please refer to chapter 3 about solar irradiation and the earth being round), but are limited by their low precipitation.  Desert flora or plant life is located on only 10% of desert area.  They consist of mainly annuals that grow and reproduce during the brief rainy season.  The main flora are succulents that store water, have waxy cuticles to prevent water loss, they may have few modified small leaves or needles, and have large shallow root systems. 

III.  Chaparrals are desert types located in the mediterranean area.  Chaparrals are characterized by its distinct rainy season and more so by its extremes.  Summer temperatures can reach a high of approximately 40 degrees Celsius and winter temperatures an reach a low of approximately -15 degrees Celsius.  Plants and animals inhabitats are drought adapted to aide survival. Plant life are similar in characteristics to desert plants with mainly shrub/brush type species.

== Soil ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil '''Soil''']is the foundation for terrestrial systems.  It is a mixture of organic (living and nonliving) and inorganic material.  The organic part is contributed by plants, animals, and microbes.  The inorganic part is a result of weathering.

===Soil Layering===
Soil is a composition of many different layers.  The first(top) layer is the '''O Horizon''' which is then compsed of 2 sublayers the O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; layers.  The O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the intact organic layer which is made up of dead organic matter and leaf litter.  The O&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is contains mostly humus and is situated next to the A Horizon.  The entire O Horizon is about 10cm deep.  Deserts usually lack the O Horizon. 

The next layer is the '''A Horizon'''.  This is what most consider the topsoil, it is a mixture of weathered rock(clay, sand, and silt) from lower layers and organic material from the O Horizon.  This is the area where there are the most roots, microbes, and invertebrates.  This horizon usually has a high respiration rate, and has most of the nutrients leeched to lower layers by water.  The top 2 layers combined (O and A Horizons) are on average about 0.5m deep.  

The next layer is the '''E Horizon''' (or Eluviation Horizon).  This layer has the least amount of dissolved nutrients.  This layer can have a clay pan formed at the bottom which is highly compacted clay which prevents weathering of rock below.  The also prevents tap roots from reaching the C Horizon.  This may also cause the area above to become water-logged.  

Below the E horizon is the Illuviation Horizon of '''B Horizon'''.  This is the area where leechates collect, and most tap roots exist.  It is usually mineral rich and contains little organic material.  It is usually about 0.5m deep. 
Below the B Horizon is the '''C Horizon''', which is the lowest soil, layer is commonly called the subsoil.  This is mostly weathered parent material.  This is usually about 0.5m deep also.

Lastly is the inorganic material of the soil or the '''R Horizon'''.  This is also called bedrock which is a result of weathering from wind, water, temperature, and plants.

===Particle Size===
[[Image:Differences in the size of sand.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Different sizes of particles in sand]]

The particle size of soil is correlated to the amount of surface area of the particles and the charge of the surface area.  A decrease in particle size equals an increase in surface area which in turn equals an increase in a negative charge of the surface area.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) designates types of soil by the size of the particles in the soil. Clay consists of particles smaller than 0.002mm and has the largest water capacity and highest nutrient capacity.  Silt consists of particles smaller than 0.05mm and has a relatively median water capacity and a median nutrient capacity.  Sand consists of particles smaller than 2mm and has the smallest water capacity and the lowest nutrient capacity.

===Acidic Soil===

Acidic soil is any type of soil that has a low pH. It is created whenever soil is very low in minerals and may be created by conifer needles. Amino acids also breaks down clay.  The breakdown of clay is done by leeching the minerals out of the soil. This leeching of minerals is due to a high Hydronium ion [H+] concentration which results of in less productive soil. Acid rain or precipitation that is unusually acidic because of emissions of sulfur and nitrogen compounds which react with the atmosphere is widely believed to be responsible for acidifying soil.

== Factors and Primes ==

'''Factors''' are numbers that you can multiply together to get another number. 
For example: 8 and 11 are factors of 88 as 8 x 11 = 88.
Similarly, 10 is a factor of 100 as 10 x 10 is 100.

'''Prime factors''' are factors which are '''prime numbers'''
 55  = 5 x 11
 100 = 2 x 5 x 2 x 5

Because 2, 5, and 11 cannot be divided by any number but 1 and itself, these numbers are called ''prime''. Prime numbers are an important part of mathematics, and the problem of factoring large numbers into primes remains fundamental to the study of computer science.
Factoring a number like 64 often requires more than one step:

 64  = 2 x 32 (32 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 16 (16 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 2 x 8 (8 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 4 (4 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2

&lt;[[Theoretical_Mechanics/Cover|Cover and Inter-Wiki]]
==Contents==
* [[/Vector Algebra/]]
Most of the math in mechanics involves vectors, understanding them is essential for understanding mechanics. This section covers the basics of vector math.
*[[/Statics/]]
Statics is about balance. It studies the relations between different bodies at rest.

===Forces And Their Effects===

====Force====
A force is an interaction between 2 objects. If there aren't 2 (or more) objects there can't be a force. The objects do not necesarrily have to touch. e.g. Gravity, electromagnetic and electrostatic forces.

A force is represented by a vector: the magnitude represents the magnitude of the force; The direction represents the direction in which the force acts; the origin defines where the forces acts on the object.

====Effects Of Forces====
A net force acting on an object can have five effects: tension, compression, shear, translation or rotation. 

Note that this translation is according to Aristotelian Physics which is founded on the belief ii that something moves, it must have a mover, i.e. force causing change in position. This is not true according to Newtonian physics in which force changes the velocity of an object.         

=====Translation=====
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Transl.png|none|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;Translation of a rectangle&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

*The object moves in a direction parallel to itself.
*The effect is defined by the magnitude and direction of the acting force.
*A is the object at its original position.
*A' and &lt;nowiki&gt;A''&lt;/nowiki&gt; are the object translated along respectively the X- and the Y-axis.
&lt;nowiki&gt;A'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the object translate along both axis.

=====Rotation=====
[[File:Rotation of a rectangle.png|center|thumb|250px|Rotation of a rectangle]]

*The object rotates around a point.
*:The original rectangle (left) is rotated around its center. The result is displayed to the right. The dotted rectangle show the location of the original rectangle.
*The object rotates around an axis.
*:E.g. A door. Imagine a line through the hinges, this is the axis. The door rotates around this axis.

=====Translation and Rotation=====
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Tran rot.png|none|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;translation and Rotation of a rectangle&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

*The object doesn't move parallel nor does it rotate around a fixed point or axle.

==Kinematics==
Kinematics describes the position, speed and acceleration of a point or a body and the relations between them without regard to the cause of the acceleration.

==Dynamics==
Dynamics connects statics with kinematics by connecting the cause (forces) with the effect (acceleration). This is where the three laws of Newton fit in.

As well as the Newtonian laws, there are other formulations of mechanics; Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. These formulations of mechanics focus more on energy than force.

== Overhaul ==

I've completely overhauled this page, and moved the information into neat subpages which are more manageable. I have also moved the page from &quot;Programming:x86 Assembly&quot; to simply [[x86 Assembly]], and have instituted the &quot;forward-slash&quot; naming convention for subpages. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:09, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Ask for Help ==

Would someone please work on this page. It's a good quick start guide at most right now, but to a newcomer to assembly like myself, it gives little info. The the example for mov for instance is more advanced than what is previously talked about. There isn't any details about syntax before that point. I get the gist of it, but it would be better for someone to add a section before that some time which gives a very basic program and gives details of what each line does and if it's always needed or platform specific (say from Windows to Linux to 16 bit Dos even.)

--[[User:HarleyL|HarleyL]] 13:42, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

When I came to this book a month ago seeking to learn NASM, I didn't get much out of it. When I returned recently, I realized there is a fair bit of info here, but it's mostly in a reference book format. What do people think about turning section 2 into the big thrust -making lesson plans for each of the mentioned assemblers- and then moving the rest to the back as appendices?
[[User:Gabriel Lein|Gabriel Lein]] 15:05, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

In [[X86 Assembly/X86 Architecture#Addressing_modes]], what is the difference between base displacement and direct offset addressing?


In section 2.2 x86 instruction set although the book mentions both styles of syntax it does not make clear which syntax the examples are using, although the comments sometimes make this clear it would be worthwhile to have a note at the start of the section or with each example stating which syntax is used. 

Also in the examples the instructions are suffixed with the size of operand (l, b or w) which although improves readability it generates confusion for beginners because those features appear to be GNU (GAS) specific and may not work in their respective assembler a quick note about this would alleviate the confusion.

== Reverse Engineering Wikibook ==

I have added some links from the book I've been working on, [[Reverse Engineering]] to point to this page. It would be nice if this book was beefed up a little bit, and maybe if it included at least some info on Intel syntax as well, because the RE book uses mostly Intel. If nobody else jumps on to this task, i might work on it some myself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 01:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Other resources ==

I'm not sure if anyone is interested, but there is a guide on the same topic at http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/. downloadable as PDF or POSTSCRIPT, 195 pages long.

== Order of second byte ==

I have done some study recently via ICY Hexplorer and an x86 ASM help file, and I noticed that for the second byte whoever wrote it had it somewhat reversed. It was originally Mod-Reg-R/M, whereas it's actually Mod-R/M-Reg, so I changed it to be so, as well as changed the hexadecimal representation of it. I hope nobody minds, as I just found an error and had to correct it.

== Context switching? ==

Some information on context switching would be interesting [[User:69.31.174.216|69.31.174.216]] 21:54, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Print this string&quot; MBR / GNU AS? ==
I use GNU AS (+&quot;objcopy -O binary&quot; to get raw content) and because here sadly isn't any mbr examples for it here and this place feels so awkwardly quiet anyway that I just have to say something I'll bother you with this question I might solve myself too. So, I have the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
.code16
Start:	xor %bh, %bh;
	mov $0xe, %ah;
	mov String, %si;

Print:	movb %cs:(%bp, %si), %al;
	cmp %al, '\0;
	je Infin;
	int $0x10;
	inc %si;
	jmp Print;

Infin:	jmp Infin;

String:	.ascii	&quot;Insert string here\0&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem is that the label addresses aren't based on 0x7c00 and I don't know what to do to get them so. Also, is there some shorter way of doing this? --[[Special:Contributions/212.149.216.233|212.149.216.233]] ([[User talk:212.149.216.233|talk]]) 15:30, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

: You need one conditional branch to exit the loop.
: You also need a branch at the end of the loop to return to the top of the loop.
: Does that mean you need two branch instructions in the loop?
: Often assembly language programmers put the conditional branch at the end of the loop -- then they only need one branch instruction in the loop, rather than two.
: Smart assembly language programmers use subroutines that have already been written and tested.

== Copyright of intel - amd developers manuals. ==

Hi. I'm writing a x86 assembly manual for [http://el.wikibooks.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82_%CF%83%CE%B5_%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_%CE%B3%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1_(GNU_%CF%83%CF%85%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1_-_%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_x86) el.wikibooks].

Of the more than two million known species of [[w:insects| insects]], honeybees have been the subject of more studies than all of the rest combined. Man has invested many uncountable hours learning the ways of the honeybee. Much of this time was not spent in a laboratory, studying the bee as an organism for the sake of science. Rather this time was invested because honeybees, due to their products including honey and wax, were, and still are great commodities. The intertwining of the history of man and bee is rich in both lore and science. It was said by [[w:Democritus| Democritus]] that bees could be created from the specially prepared carcass of a beaten ox. This obviously is not true, but it is a good example of the lengths people would go to create a healthy productive colony of bees.
Honeybees are included as one of the few insects which are [[w:colony (biology)|colonial]], this group also includes some species of wasps, ants, and termites. Honeybees, though they have a feral counterpart, are often maintained by farmers similarly to any other product bearing livestock. Honeybees are a subset of [[w:bee|bees]] which fall into the Order [[w:Hymenoptera| Hymenoptera]] and Suborder [[w:Apocrita| Apocrita]]. Of the roughly 20,000 known species of bee, four are classed as honeybees including ''[[w:Apis florae| Apis Florae]]'', ''[[w:Apis dorsata| Apis Dorsata]]'', ''[[w:Apis Cerana| Apis Cerana]]'', and ''[[w:Apis Mellifera| Apis Mellifera]]''.  The Western Honeybee (Apis Mellifera) is the most commonly kept bee within Europe and the Americas.

==Honey Production==
Bees have become the great interest of many, almost wholly due to the fact that they produce honey. Being less than twenty percent water, honey cannot support yeast, bacteria or microorganisms and is therefore a form of sugar that is completely resistant to spoiling. Honey is created by the refinement of nectar that the bees must collect from flowers. Once created, the majority of the honey is used as the main food source for the hive. Any extra honey can be harvested by the beekeeper and used for many tasks.

==Life Cycle==
The life cycle of a honeybee exists in three distinct independent stages. After hatching from [[Beekeeping/Egg| egg]], the bee exists initial as a [[Beekeeping/Larva| larval]] form. Soon after the larval form, the secondary stage as [[Beekeeping/Pupae| pupae]] is reached. Finally the pupae develop into the adult bee. The adult bee may take the form of a [[Beekeeping/Worker| worker]], a [[Beekeeping/Drone| drone]], or a [[Beekeeping/Queen| queen bee]]. It is common for worker bees to live up to nine days if their main task in life is heavy foraging. Conversely, workers that do menial tasks in the hive will survive for around three weeks. Losing a forager from time to time does not have a crucial impact on the overall well being of the hive. A strong beehive has between ten and twenty thousand foragers at any given time. The queen also possesses the ability to replace any lost bees by laying up to 2,000 eggs a day. Developing [[Beekeeping/Brood| brood]], depending on the season and race of bee, can fill up to a full third of the hive.

==Tasks==
Bees have the nearly unique task of keeping the world alive. Bees are the main factors within flower pollination. Without pollination, plants would be unable to reproduce and thereby would not be present for nourishing other animals within the food chain. Evolving from wasps nearly 100 million years ago, bees have become quite specialized in the tasks that they need to complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[How to Write a Program|Programming:How to Write a Program]] Back to Table of Contents&lt;BR&gt;

Programming architecture is an amazing thing. Some architecture forms are incredibly complex, requiring years of practice to effectively master. Other forms require little or no previous development experience, making this category the best option for beginners. Please note that this discussion centers upon general development theory and not language or platform-specific technologies. Such information is critical to your success as a developer but a foundation must be laid in the mindset of what it means to develop software as a programmer before venturing beyond the general in search of the specific language(s) of your choice, depending upon your goals, needs, and existing skill set(s). Here are a few simple concepts to remember about programming in general:


== Logic ==
Logic is more than geometry, as that math subject is where the majority of individuals discover ancient concepts that still dominate our thought processes today. Logic is an orderly definable process that arrives at a conclusion using pre-determined rules agreed upon by all related parties. I define logic in this light as it is the center point of all development. Without logic, creating the desired software logic in a way that could be interpreted by a computer of any kind would remain an impossible task. Thus, logic lays a foundation upon which both man (humans) and machine (computers) agree to operate on the same playing field. This is one of the greatest tensions in application development, as software bugs often arise from a miscommunication in the area of logic. 
For example, if the developer/programmer desires X functionality, and mistaking codes the logic in a way that the computer interprets as Y functionality, the developer/programmer (I will continue to use these two terms interchangeably) must re-evaluate his code to see where his thought process (logically speaking) did not line up with the computer's interpretation of that process. One of the most frequent headaches for new developers stems from the fact that it is easier to visualize the software functionality in a creative way than it is to interpret that concept into an orderly series of commands, requests, and other functions required to build what the individual desires. I will deal with creativity next, but suffice it to say that programming is one of those few trades that will always be an artform and a science at the same time. For this reason, a programmer just beginning to develop software must learn to search out the uncommon answers (creativity) while keeping his/her feet planted firmly on the ground (logic) to make the desired functionality a reality.

== Creativity ==
Creativity is the second-most important asset a developer can bring to the table when writing new software. It is a system of thought processes meshing together that generate new options for solving unique development challenges. No developer truly worth his salt can exist in this industry without learning to open his mind to new ways of thought, expression, and recognition. Indeed, it is the personal belief of the original author that a lack of creativity hinders the potential of every programmer who doesn't learn the power achieved in overcoming the 'box' syndrome. 
Simply stated, programmers are notorious for thinking inside the realm of what has been discovered, mapped, and utilized by a predecessor or associate, resulting in an imaginary space called the 'box'. It is in this box that the developer works, associates meaning, and derives solutions. The mark of a talented developer is the innate (or learned) ability to dynamically resize or reconfigure the 'box' in him/her to meet the unique programming challenge at hand. Breaking outside the barriers of the box is daunting, as it requires a perspective that may not exist within the developer himself/herself. A wise person once said, 'When you stop learning, you stop leading.' I humbly modify this statement for the purposes of software development and say, 'When you stop learning, you stop the flow of software innovation.' Achieving results in a fixed box may work for a time, perhaps even years if the box is significantly developed. However, the nature of the programming trade stipulates constant learning for the purpose of maintaining an edge in the industry.
I'm focusing on the 'box' concept as it is truly impossible, I believe, to impart true learning in the area of creativity. It must be experienced for yourself, as you begin to think about your world from many different perspectives. If you choose to develop software for others as an [[w:ISV|ISV]] (independent software vendor) or system integrator, you will need to hold interviews with every type of user your software will service. Getting into the minds of others and discovering their wants and needs in terms of software functionality is the most rewarding, and yet oftentimes most challenging, aspect of being a programmer. Embrace alternate perspectives and alternate learning approaches to bring more mental collateral to the table that will enhance your creative edge.

== Abstraction ==
Abstraction, simply put, is the number of layers sitting between you and the underlying hardware you’re targeting in the development cycle. For example, an ASIC developer writing software mapping for a video chipset operates at an incredibly different level of abstraction than a script developer for web-enabled applications. These are two separate worlds for many reasons, but in fact the web-enabled application developer may indirectly utilize the chipset writer’s codebase if he references a graphical component on a system having that chipset deployed. Always remember that a high level of abstraction means the software functionality sits on top of many layers of logic ‘plumbing’ in comparison to low-level abstraction that sits directly on top of the hardware in use. Developers often gravitate to the abstraction level that best fits their present skills and abilities, but don’t let complex programming at a low-level of abstraction scare you from attempting to develop software in that space. Find a beginning niche and work your way toward a desired level of expertise in the area that fits your desire and needs best.

* [[c2:ArchitectureAntiPattern]] mentions that too often, people design overly-complicated architectures. It is far better ([[c2:CanAnArchitectureEmerge]]) to get a simple version working first, then later improve it.

Some of the transliterations and indeed the roots themselves written in the Devanagari are incorrect.  For instance, the Sanskrit word for the number nine is transliterated as &quot;nav&quot; although it is written in the Devanagari as &quot;nava&quot;; and the root for English &quot;foot&quot; is not written with a long 'a' as the middle vowel, as it should be.  Ian R.


Let's make some progress with this page, huh?

Why not just take a public domain textbook like Macdonell's A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, and put the whole thing on-line.


Congratulations and Thanks for your efforts to preserve/create content about Sanskrit here. One of the oldest and the most scientific languages of this world, and a gateway into great literary texts. I am slightly familiar with Sanskrit (and fully with Hindi). I hope to contribute what ever I can to this text. 

Congrats on again and you are doing an excellent work - [[User:Chaturganj|Pankaj]]

== for grammarians only? ==

I think some of these lessons could be made more accessible. Don't worry, i know that sanskrit is extremely complex and difficult, but as far as i can tell the lesson on nouns and 'basic grammar' just sort of throws the case terms at people (Nom., Acc., Inst., etc.) without any explanation of their uses (not to mention things like (Erg./Abs.) that only linguistics buffs and nerds like me would understand upon seeing them without a great deal of explanation). You have done a very nice job so far, however, and i'd like to extend my complements. I'd like to add explanations for the grammatical terms, but need to know how to best make it fit the format and work with somebody who knows more about their particular uses in Sanskrit, as I only know them on a general level. Good luck in expanding it.

== Basic noun forms ==
Hello, this is my first edit.  I am not too familiar with Sanskrit, however I feel that a simple set of 'vibhaktee's from more than just one gender ought to be uploaded.  
Also, the current verb matrix contains only the suffixes for the present.  
Over the next few days, I will try to add some new material.  Since I have no idea how Wikibooks works, I just hope I don't break the tubes.  Please bear with me.

As a final note, I am not a linguist and have no idea what datives, ablatives and genitives are.  I will try to make these lessons as simple as possible, but due to my very limited Sanskrit education my lessons won't include much.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Beekeeping hive tool.jpg|thumb|right|10&quot; Hive Tool]]
==Usage==
;Hive tools can be used for
:*loosening [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]] and [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]].
:*scraping off excess bur comb or propolis from hive parts.
:*removing a bee sting from the body
;Hive tools, when jointly used for beekeeping, should not be used for
:*Mixing paint, varnish or chemicals

==Selecting a Design==
There exist multiple designs of hive tools, but in truth most any kind of pry bar with a blade will work. If you find that money is burning a hole in your pocket, feel free to invest in a high quality Teflon coated hive tool that would likely outlast any beekeeper.
Hive tools generally come in 7 and 10-inch varieties. If possible, before purchasing, see how the tool fits in your hand, and buy the one you are most comfortable with. Although it may not seem like an issue, the color of your hive tool may be important. If possible, purchase a brightly colored hive tool or paint it such. A brightly colored hive tool will stand out a lot better when dropped. It is rather difficult to continue working if you lose your tool.

==Purchasing==
Hive tools are sold by nearly every [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources| bee keeping supply house]], but similar items can be found at most every hardware store. Simply look for a quality scraper/nail puller type of tool.

==Maintenance==
*It is advisable to sharpen the blade of a hive tool when needed. It is difficult to predict the intervals when such would need to be done, but most beekeepers do so at least once a year.
*If a hive tool is used on a hive that may be infected by disease it is often advisable to clean the tool by flame.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavTechnique}}
== Origins and reasoning ==
The original horn had no valves. The technique for playing notes between the open partials of the harmonic series was opening and closing the throat of the bell with the hand. When valves were added to the instrument, horn players opted to keep the hand in the bell. They had three primary reasons for doing so:
#The tone is darkened significantly, recreating the timbre of the Natural Horn.
#Pitches are more easily controlled. The deeper the hand goes into the bell, the lower the pitch.
#The hand is in place to perform extended techniques like ''stopped'' and ''echo horn''.

== Steps in putting hand in the bell correctly ==
=== The American method ===
#Assemble right hand as though it is going to be shaking another hand.
#Bring the thumb in so it points in the same direction as the other fingers.
#Place the hand inside the bell with the metal touching the back of the hand.

Some of the weight of the horn should be held up by the thumb and possibly the index-finger.

=== The French method ===
#Hold right hand out flat with palm down and drop thumb to create a 90-degree angle with fingers.
#Place the hand inside the bell until the thumb hits the bottom wall of the bell.

Some of the weight of the horn should be held up by the first knuckles and the back of the hand.

If you experiment with both of these positions, you will quickly learn how much the placement of the hand in the bell affects the overall timbre and volume of the instrument.

== Miscellaneous Information ==

The hand should certainly &quot;disrupt&quot; the sound coming out of the bell. Otherwise, there would be no point to having the hand it the bell. However, the hand should not be disturbing the sound enough to cause it to sound stuffy.

Visually depicted, one should imagine as though sound is emerging as a stream of water and the palm is carefully guiding the stream along the back of the forearm.

'''Korean pronouns''' pose some difficulty to speakers of English due to their complexity.  The Korean language makes extensive use of speech levels and honorifics in its grammar, and Korean pronouns also change depending on the social distinction between the speaker and the person or persons spoken to.

In general, Korean speakers avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms. This is done in several ways:
* Omit the subject if it can be implied by the context. Most English sentences need subjects, but note Korean sentences do not.
* Use the appropriate title. For example, talking to a teacher or certain other professionals (e.g. a manager), one may use 선생님 (''seonsaengnim'', &quot;teacher&quot;).
* Use kinship terms, even to address someone who is not family:
** [[wikt:언니|언니]] (''eonni'', &quot;older sister&quot;), used by females to address a slightly elder female
** [[wikt:누나|누나]] (''nuna'', &quot;older sister&quot;), used by males to address a slightly elder female
** [[wikt:오빠|오빠]] (''oppa'', &quot;older brother&quot;), used by females to address a slightly elder male
** [[wikt:형|형]] (''hyeong'', &quot;older brother&quot;), used by males to address a slightly elder male
** [[wikt:아줌마|아줌마]] (''ajumma'', &quot;middle aged woman&quot;)
** [[wikt:아저씨|아저씨]] (''ajeoshi'', &quot;middle aged man&quot;)
** [[wikt:할머니|할머니]] (''halmeoni'', &quot;grandmother&quot;)
** [[wikt:할아버지|할아버지]] (''harabeoji'', &quot;grandfather&quot;)
* Use the plural [[wikt:여러분|여러분]] (''yeoreobun'', &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot;) where applicable.
* If talking to someone younger than the speaker, one may use the person's name.

|}

The first and second person pronouns have both an informal and a polite (humble/honorific) form. The polite form is used when speaking to someone older or of high social status. 당신 (the plain second person singular pronoun) literally means &quot;friend&quot;, but is only used as a form of address and is more polite than 친구 (''chingu''), the usual word for &quot;friend&quot;. 당신 is also sometimes used as the Korean equivalent of &quot;dear&quot; as a form of address. Also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, 당신 must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couples. In that way it can be used in an ironic sense when used between strangers.

Of the third person pronouns, the feminine forms sound awkward and are mostly used when translating texts from other languages. 그 was originally used for both genders and still is in conversation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Beekeeping smoker.jpg|thumb|right|Smoker]]

==Usage==
Smokers are likely one of the most important tools that a beekeeper should have with them. A smoker has two main purposes. Primarily a smoker will encourage bees to engorge on honey. Encouraging honey engorging is beneficial as bees with stomachs filled with honey (or nectar) are unable to easily sting. The exact reasoning for this engorging behavior is unknown, though it likely evolved as a means of saving as much of the viable hive products by moving them in the case of a forest fire. Secondly the smoke produced from a smoker can mask scents and [[Beekeeping/Pheromones| pheromones]]. Most importantly it hides the alarm scent administered by [[Beekeeping/Guarding Behavior| guard bees]] and the alarm scent present during a sting.

===Lighting a Smoker===
#Open the smoker and clear it of any debris.
#Insert a loosely crumbled piece of newspaper or similar kindling. If necessary push it to the bottom of the smoker with your [[Beekeeping/Hive Tool|hive tool]].
#With a long nosed lighter or long match ignite the kindling.
#Be sure the kindling is sufficiently in flame with a few long slow bellows pumps. 
#Slowly add your larger kindling or smoker fuel and pump the bellows to ignite. If necessary, stoke the fire with your hive tool.
#After the kindling is properly on fire, which may take 5 or 10 minutes, begin slowly adding your smoker fuel.
#Continue pumping the bellows as you add fuel no more than &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the maximum capacity of the smoker. Over filling the smoker only insures that you will spit ash and ember as you work the hive.

; Proper smoker fuels
:*burlap rags, cotton rags, cotton string or twine
:*Woodchips, pine needles, twigs, sticks, dried leaves and grass
:*Stove pellets
:*Charcoal &lt;small&gt;(burns long and hot, may be best to use with other fuel)&lt;/small&gt;
:*Tobacco

; Improper smoker fuels
:*poison ivy, poison sumac, etc
:*insulation material
:*plastic or rubber
:*newspaper &lt;small&gt;(as sole fuel source)&lt;/small&gt;
:*greasy rags

==Selecting a Smoker==
Smokers commonly come in tin and stainless steel varieties in the sizes of 4x7 inches, 4x10 inches. Often options such as shields, finger guards and bellow material are also available. As a rule, steel smokers last longer than tin when well cared for. Shields and finger guards are not necessary, though they do tend to be helpful in preventing minor burns. Guarded smokers often also have a hook to allow the smoker to be hung from an open hive. Bellow material also does not matter much, most commonly there are options for leather and wood or plastic and rubber, both function the same, the rubber is simply less authentic.

==Purchasing==
When purchasing a smoker buy the largest you can afford, preferably made of steel. Smaller smokers by virtue of their size have a smaller reservoir and thereby don’t burn as long or with as much smoke as their larger cousins. 

==Maintenance==
*Steel smokers can occasionally be scoured with steel wool to remove cooked on soot and tar. If you would prefer you can also clean a smoker with a torch by simply burning the stuck on tar until it becomes ash.

==Tips==
*If a bee stings you or your gear apply a liberal amount of smoke to the area (after removing the stinger) to mask the alarm odor.
*Practice with a smoker before actually needing to use it, you will appreciate the ability to create a large masking cloud of smoke for a quick get away when things become difficult.
*By placing a properly sized, heavily perforated tin can, such as one which soup or fruit comes in, in side the smoker you can create a nice fire pan. The perforations allow for better air intake and easier lighting.

      <comment>/* 1. Assignment */ The ||= operator resolves to x || x = &quot;default&quot;, bypassing the assignment fully if the value is already set.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Operators ==
=== 1. Assignment ===

Assignment in Ruby is done using the equal operator &quot;=&quot;. This is both for variables and objects, but since strings, floats, and integers are actually objects in Ruby, you're always assigning objects.

Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  myvar = 'myvar is now this string'
  var = 321
  dbconn = Mysql::new('localhost','root','password')
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Self assignment'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = 1           #=&gt;1
  x += x          #=&gt;2
  x -= x          #=&gt;0
  x += 4          #=&gt;x was 0 so x= + 4 # x is positive 4
  x *= x          #=&gt;16
  x **= x         #=&gt;18446744073709551616 # Raise to the power
  x /= x          #=&gt;1
&lt;/source&gt;

A frequent question from C and C++ types is &quot;How do you increment a variable? Where are ++ and -- operators?&quot;
In Ruby, one should use x+=1 and x-=1 to increment or decrement a variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = 'a'
  x.succ!         #=&gt;&quot;b&quot; : succ! method is defined for String, but not for Integer types
&lt;/sourcE&gt;

'''Multiple assignments'''

Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  var1, var2, var3 = 10, 20, 30
  puts var1           #=&gt;var1 is now 10
  puts var2           #=&gt;var2 is now 20,var3...etc
  
  myArray=%w(John Michel Fran Doug) # %w() can be used as syntactic sugar to simplify array creation
  var1,var2,var3,var4=*myArray
  puts var1           #=&gt;John
  puts var4           #=&gt;Doug

  names,school=myArray,'St. Whatever'
  names               #=&gt;[&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Michel&quot;, &quot;Fran&quot;, &quot;Doug&quot;]
  school              #=&gt;&quot;St. Whatever&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Conditional assignment'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = find_something() #=&gt;nil
  x ||= &quot;default&quot;      #=&gt;&quot;default&quot; : value of x will be replaced with &quot;default&quot;, but only if x is nil or false
  x ||= &quot;other&quot;        #=&gt;&quot;default&quot; : value of x is not replaced if it already is other than nil or false
&lt;/source&gt;

Operator ||= is a shorthand form of the expression:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
 x || x = &quot;default&quot; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Operator ||= can be shorthand for code like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = &quot;(some fallback value)&quot; unless respond_to? :x or x
&lt;/source&gt;

In same way &amp;&amp;= operator works:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = get_node() #=&gt;nil
  x &amp;&amp;= x.next_node #=&gt; nil : x will be set to x.next_node, but only if x is NOT nil or false
  x = get_node() #=&gt;Some Node
  x &amp;&amp;= x.next_node #=&gt;Next Node
&lt;/source&gt;

Operator &amp;&amp;= is a shorthand form of the expression:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
 x = x &amp;&amp; x.get_node()
&lt;/source&gt;

== Scope ==

In Ruby there's a local scope, a global scope, an instance scope, and a class scope.

=== Local Scope ===

Example:
  var=2
  4.times do |x| 
    puts x=x*var
  end  
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;0,2,4,6&lt;/font&gt;
  puts x &lt;span style=&quot;color: #007700;&quot;&gt;#=&gt;undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object (NameError)&lt;/span&gt;

This error appears because this x(toplevel) is not the x(local) inside the do..end block the x(local) is a local variable to the block, whereas when trying the puts x(toplevel) we're calling a x variable that is in the top level scope, and since there's not one, Ruby protests.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Global scope ===

  4.times do |var|
    $global=$global*var
  end  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;0,2,4,6 last assignment of $global is 6&lt;/font&gt;
  puts $global
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 6&lt;/font&gt;
This works because prefixing a variable with a dollar sign makes the variable a global.

=== Instance scope ===

Within methods of a class, you can share variables by prefixing them with an @.

  class A
    def setup
      @instvar = 1
    end
    def go
      @instvar = @instvar*2
      puts @instvar
    end
  end
  instance = A.new
  instance.setup
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 2&lt;/font&gt;
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 4&lt;/font&gt;

=== Class scope ===

A class variable is one that is like a &quot;static&quot; variable in Java.  It is shared by all instances of a class.

  class A
    @@classvar = 1
    def go
      @@classvar = @@classvar*2
      puts @@classvar
    end
  end
  instance = A.new
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 2&lt;/font&gt;
  instance = A.new
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 4 -- variable is shared across instances&lt;/font&gt;


Here's a demo showing the various types:

 $variable
  class Test
    def initialize(arg1='kiwi')
      @instvar=arg1
      @@classvar=@instvar+' told you so!!'
      localvar=@instvar
    end
    def print_instvar
      puts @instvar
    end
    def print_localvar
      puts @@classvar
      puts localvar
    end
  end
  var=Test.new
  var.print_instvar              &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;&quot;kiwi&quot;, it works because a @instance_var can be accesed inside the class&lt;/font&gt;
  var.print_localvar             &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;undefined local variable or method 'localvar' for #&lt;Test:0x2b36208 @instvar=&quot;kiwi&quot;&gt; (NameError).&lt;/font&gt;
This will print the two lines &quot;kiwi&quot; and &quot;kiwi told you so!!&quot;, then fail with a undefined local variable or method 'localvar' for #&lt;Test:0x2b36208 @instvar=&quot;kiwi&quot;&gt; (NameError). Why? Well, in the scope of the method print_localvar there doesn't exists localvar, it exists in method initialize(until GC kicks it out). On the other hand, class variables '@@classvar' and '@instvar' are in scope across the entire class and, in the case of @@class variables, across the children classes.

  class SubTest &lt; Test
    def print_classvar
      puts @@classvar
    end
  end
  newvar=SubTest.new              &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#newvar is created and it has @@classvar with the same value as the var  instance of Test!!&lt;/font&gt;
  newvar.print_classvar           &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;kiwi told you so!! &lt;/font&gt;
Class variables have the scope of parent class AND children, these variables can live across classes, and can be affected by the children actions ;-)

  class SubSubTest &lt; Test
    def print_classvar
      puts @@classvar
    end
    def modify_classvar
      @@classvar='kiwi kiwi waaai!!'
    end
  end
  subtest=SubSubTest.new          
  subtest.modify_classvar          &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#lets add a method that modifies the contents of @@classvar in  SubSubTest&lt;/font&gt;
  subtest.print_classvar
This new child of Test also has @@classvar with the original value newvar.print_classvar. The value of @@classvar has been changed to 'kiwi kiwi waaai!!' This shows that @@classvar is &quot;shared&quot; across parent and child classes.

== Default scope ==

When you don't enclose your code in any scope specifier, ex:

  @a = 33

it affects the default scope, which is an object called &quot;main&quot;.

For example, if you had one script that says

 @a = 33
 require 'other_script.rb'

and other_script.rb says

 puts @a
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 33&lt;/font&gt;

They could share variables.

Note however, that the two scripts don't share local variables.

== Local scope gotchas ==


Typically when you are within a class, you can do as you'd like for definitions, like.

&lt;pre&gt;
class A
  a = 3
  if a == 3

    def go 
       3
    end
  else
    def go
       4
    end  
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

And also, procs &quot;bind&quot; to their surrounding scope, like

&lt;pre&gt;
 a = 3
 b = proc { a }
 b.call # 3 -- it remembered what a was
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, the &quot;class&quot; and &quot;def&quot; keywords cause an *entirely new* scope.

&lt;pre&gt;
class A
  a = 3
  def go
     return a # this won't work!
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can get around this limitation by using define_method, which takes a block and thus keeps the outer scope (note that you can use any block you want, to, too, but here's an example).

&lt;pre&gt;
class A
   a = 3
  define_method(:go) { 
      a
  }
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's using an arbitrary block

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 3
PROC = proc { a } # gotta use something besides a local
# variable because that &quot;class&quot; makes us lose scope.

class A
  define_method(:go, &amp;PROC)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

or here
&lt;pre&gt;
 class A
 end
a = 3
 A.class_eval do
   define_method(:go) do
       puts a
   end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Logical And ==

The binary &quot;and&quot; operator will return the logical conjunction of its two operands. It is the same as &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; but with a lower precedence.
Example:
 a = 1
 b = 2
 c = nil
 puts &quot;yay all my arguments are true&quot; if a and b
 puts &quot;oh no, one of my argument is false&quot; if a and c

== Logical Or ==

The binary &quot;or&quot; operator will return the logical disjunction of its two operands. It is the same as &quot;||&quot; but with a lower precedence.
Example:
 a = nil
 b = &quot;foo&quot;
 c = a || b  # c is set to &quot;foo&quot; it's the same as saying c = (a || b)
 c = a or b  # c is set to nil   it's the same as saying (c = a) || b which is not what you want.

      <comment>/* Basic Components of an LMS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Prior to determining the suitability of a [[w:Learning management system|LMS]] for use in a particular environment we need to have an understanding of the technical issues that surround such a purchase.  Along with the technical issues we need to understand the terminology and physical equipment needed for an installation of an LMS.  This article attempts to provide the reader with an understanding of the technical issues, terminology and physical equipment that influence the selection of a learning management system.

==Basic Needs==
As training professionals we may have similar needs when it comes to selecting a Learning Management System.  Some of the basic needs may include the following:
:*A system that tracks student records
:*A system that allows for development of training courses
:*A system that allows for the use of third-party courseware
:*A system that track student needs/requirements for training
:*A system that tracks student requirements in relation to certifications/licenses
:*A system that includes standard and customizable reporting
:*A system that allows for a variety of forms of communication 
:*A System that allows for easy retrieval of stored information

==Basic Components of an LMS==
One of the first questions you may want to ask is what type of [http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid26_gci211708%2C00.html browser] does the LMS work with? A browser is a program that allows a user to view and interact with information on the Internet.  The three most common browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Since there are different versions of browsers you will also need to know what version the LMS works with. 

In a similar vein you need to know if the LMS will work with your current [http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0%2C%2Csid9_gci212714%2C00.html operating system]. An operating system is the program that manages all the other programs on your system.  Examples of operating systems are: Linux, Windows XP, VMS, OS/400, AIX, and z/OS. 

The following components should be familiar to you as they are utilized in most LMS systems.

;'''LDAP Directory''' : Most organizations use a [http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid40_gci214076%2C00.html LDAP] (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory to centralize user accounts.  LDAP is a software protocol (or set of rules) for enabling qualified individuals to locate individuals and other resources in a network on a corporate intranet. It stores information such as user information data, phone numbers, address and reporting structure.  It also manages authentication, meaning it makes sure that you have the right to access applications. It may be used by multiple applications such as email or online expense account forms.

;'''Relational DBMS''': Maintains three or more [http://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid87_gci211895,00.html databases] used by a LMS and may also contain other databases not used by the LMS.

;'''LMS Server''': This [http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid7_gci211796%2C00.html server] is the central point for access of information by users of the LMS.  A server is a computer or device on a network that manages network resources. For example, a file server stores files, a print server manages one or more printers, a network server manages network traffic and a database server processes database queries. 

;'''Delivery Server''': Used by some LMS's to display course structures so that students can navigate through activities.  The delivery server may also track student progress data and transmit it to the LMS server.

;'''Content Server''': This server stores content files for use with the LMS.

;'''SMTP Server''': The [http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid26_gci214219%2C00.html SMTP] (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server transfers all Help Desk requests and LMS-generated e-mail.

;'''FTP Server''': The [http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0%2C%2Csid9_gci213976%2C00.html FTP](File Transfer Protocol) server stores uploaded courses prior to importing into the LMS.

;'''Authoring Tool''': Authoring tools usually run on the client workstation and enable the course developers to create content and assessments.  

===Basic Configuration of a LMS===
[[Image:Lrngmgmtconfig.png]]

==Technical Issues==
When addressing vendors and working with your IT departments the following issues should be considered:
:*Does the LMS integrate with back-end systems?  The need to pass data to other applications such as Human Resources is an important feature.  You may not have the need currently, but check to see if it is possible as it may come up as a future need.
:*Does the LMS comply to your IT department standards?  What standards does the LMS comply to? Is it compliant with Section 508 Americans with Disabilities Act?  
:*Is the system able to connect to other applications?  Does it have documented API's? An API is an application protocol interface which allows the LMS to connect to other applications.  The API's should have documentation to describe how to perform the integration. 
:*Is the system interoperable?  Can it pass information back and forth between another application like the Human Resource department system?
:*How is the LMS built?  What are databases, operating systems and clients upon which it is built?  Will your IT department be able to support this configuration?
:*Does the LMS support an LDAP directory?

Without a basic understanding of the technical issues, software and hardware associated with an LMS it would be difficult to understand what vendors are offering.  Hopefully this short article has given the reader some information to begin to understand what goes into purchasing and implementing a LMS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bees will sometimes identify the wrong hive as their home hive, and an attempt to enter the wrong hive can be a fatal mistake. Although many hive bodies are often painted a single color, some beekeepers claim to have found that a variety of bright colors can help the bees find their way back to their hives more easily. The arrangement of the hive stacks may also be important for visual recognition of the home hive. However, since bees likely use many other visual, spatial and olfactory cues to identify their home hive, the color of the hive bodies may have only a marginal effect on choice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Digital Storytelling? ==

The Digital Storytelling Association,[[http://www.dsaweb.org]] defines Digital Storytelling as &quot;the modern expression of the ancient art of storytelling. Throughout history, storytelling has been used to share knowledge, wisdom, and values. Stories have taken many different forms. Stories have been adapted to each successive medium that has emerged, from the circle of the campfire to the silver screen, and now the computer screen.&quot; &lt;br&gt;

&quot;Digital stories derive their power by weaving images, music, narrative and voice together, thereby giving deep dimension and vivid color to characters, situations, experiences, and insights. Tell your story now digitally.&quot;
- Leslie Rule, Digital Storytelling Association. &lt;br&gt;

Telling a story &quot;digitally&quot; means merging a short narrative, with corresponding audio, and various types of visual media, including photos, artwork, letters, and digital video. It also brings storytelling to the computer arena – so that it may be more easily distributed, communicated and linked with other stories, in order to create a global storytelling experience.&lt;br&gt;

On his website, Daniel Meadows outlines the parameters for what constitutes a digital story. The script must be 250 words, using 10-12 still photos and about 2 minutes long. &lt;br&gt;

Strict parameters such as these enforce a sort of diligence where artistic creation is concerned (think sonnets or haiku.) &lt;br&gt;

Here is a link to Daniel Meadows digital story webpage. There is a tutorial on this page also.  [[http://www.photobus.co.uk/index.php?id=2&amp;gallery=polyfoto.flv]]

According to Joe Lambert in his [[http://www.storycenter.org/cookbook.pdf]]&quot;Digital Storytelling Cookbook and Travelling Companion&quot; document, a good digital story must contain seven elements.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point of View – Who is the narrator and why is he/she talking to us?
&lt;li&gt;Dramatic Question – Desire – Action - Realization
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Content – What are the emotions associated with your narrative?
&lt;li&gt;The Gift of your Voice – What does your narrator sound like?
&lt;li&gt;The Power of the Soundtrack – What music sets the mood for your story?
&lt;li&gt;Economy – Keep it short and succinct.
&lt;li&gt;Pacing – The rhythm of the story helps set the tone
&lt;/ol&gt;

== History ==

Digital Storytelling came about in the early 1990's when a group of [[http://www.storycenter.org/history.html]] &quot;media artists, designers and practitioners&quot; got together to merge elements of storytelling with new digital media.

== Digital Storytelling in Education ==

According to Carole McCulloch, of Tafe Frontiers in Melbourne, Australia, Digital Storytelling can be used in educational settings to:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a competency
&lt;li&gt;Describe a process
&lt;li&gt;In Portfolios of achievement
&lt;li&gt;Develop writing skills and sense of story for younger students
&lt;/ul&gt;

In addition to the above, Digital Storytelling can be used to motivate students.  Most students love working on computers. Computers provide students access to tools they can use to enhance the expression of their thoughts and ideas in ways they might not be able to do otherwise.  Pictures, graphics, drawing tools, color and sound feed students' creativity.  Using storytelling parameters, students would also have to address the presentation of their content from aspects. They would have to use their planning and organizational skills as well as their creative ones. Through storyboarding students can develop planning and writing skills by outlining what will take place. Students also learn how to summarize an event or process for a specific audience.  The Digital Story could be viewed as a rubric to assist students in creating their projects. Although it may sound a little intimidating to some, most students would probably find it a refreshing departure from traditional educational assignments and thus more likely to stay engaged.     

Join the &quot;Digital Storytelling Network&quot; [[http://www.groups.edna.edu.au/course/view.php?id=107]] to communicate directly with Carole McCulloch, among others working with Digital Storytelling.

Faculty and graduate students at the University of Houston have created a website called the Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling [http://digitalstorytelling.coe.uh.edu/] which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.

== Things to Think about Before Implementing Into a Classroom:  A Teacher's Reflection  ==  

Although students are familiar with films and may have exposure with creating multimedia presentations, the concept of Digital Story Telling is abstract for many students.  In a recent attempt to incorporate Digital Story Telling into the elementary classroom, It became apparent that students need to be provided with examples of quality projects.  Some things that you will want to emphasize your students are:
*Planning is pertinent to creating a quality project
*Create clear illustrations
*Use a loud, clear voice when recording the narration
*Be patient
*If necessary, do things over.  

Beyond preparing students to be successful, it is pertinent that the teacher create an environment that is conducive to effective story telling.  For example, if the project is being completed in a small space, not all groups will be able to record their narrations at the same time.  Too much background noise will muddle recordings.  If you choose to have groups scan pictures for use in their presentation, you may need to stagger the groups to ensure that students are actively involved in the project whenever time is allotted to work on it.  

It is also necessary to make sure that the equipment that will be used in the creation of these projects is available.  Students will need access to computers, microphones, digital camcorders, digital cameras, scanners, and software that allows for the creation of multimedia presentations.  If your school is networked and students are not provided with file strorage large enough to hold these large electronic files, the teacher will need to develop a plan for how these projects are going to be stored while the students are working on them.

== Good Digital Stories: ==

'''Are personal:'''
''The creator of the digital presentation is in the story in a key way — as the narrator and sometimes also as the protagonist. While many digital storytelling projects feature third parties, the narrator is encouraged to personalize the tale, making it clear how the people or events in the story impacted his or her life.''

'''Begin with the story/script:'''
''In workshops by CDS, DigiTales, and others, participants are expected to narrow in on their story, writing and even recording their script before they ever begin digitizing images, importing sound effects, or using video editing tools. Jason Ohler, in an introduction to his soon-to-be-released book, Telling Your Story, points out that having students &quot;create and tell stories before they [get] to use all the empowering and distracting technology at their disposal&quot; is an important way to avoid &quot;enabling the technophile at the expense of the story teller in...students.&quot;''

'''Are concise:'''
''Typically, a digital story will run from two to five minutes in length. This means tight editing and a very specific focus. In Scott County, Kentucky, Leslie Flanders and Jeanne Biddle explain to students that the goal is to narrow the story down to a single &quot;nugget&quot; — one central idea or message.''

'''Use readily-available source materials:'''
''Although camcorders might be used in the creation of a digital story, they are not essential. In fact, some consider them a distraction from the end product. Instead, many digital stories rely heavily on photographs, hand-drawn illustrations, and other scanned-in images, along with transition effects, to accompany the recorded narrative. The staff at CDS refer to the medium they teach as being like &quot;PowerPoint on steroids.&quot; They have embraced this approach because it &quot;puts the participant in the editing chair, with a minimal amount of preparation.&quot;''

'''Include universal story elements:'''
''Although proponents of digital storytelling describe and label these terms in a number of different ways, good stories — digital or not — include essential elements such as conflict, transformation, and closure. Furthermore, they are told in a way that allows the audience to, as Ohler puts it, &quot;identify with them, remember them, and be changed by them.&quot;''

'''Involve collaboration:'''
''&quot;Story circles,&quot; in which participants give and receive feedback on their stories and scripts, are an important part of many digital storytelling workshops. As Joe Lambert puts it, &quot;Storytelling is meant to be a collaborative art. It is much more realistic this way, and much more fun.&quot;''

== Tools ==

If you're interested in creating some digital stories, Carole McCulloch suggests the following tools to get started:

Photo Story 3 software&lt;br&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx &lt;br&gt;
Free music clips&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The MS WindowsMobile(SmartPhone) OS came out without a J2ME JVM at least from Microsoft.  However, because of consumer and Mobile Operator demand the OEMs of the MS WindowsMobile platform started partnering with JVM vendors to provide this functionality.

==HTC==
In 2001 High Technology Computer gained a contract from Microsoft to design MS Smartphones based on MS's Stinger concept design.  As both consumers and mobile operators demanded java functionality in form of J2ME/MIDP; HTC partnered with several JVM OEMs to bring this functionality to HTC MS powered smartphones. HTC smartphones can be found with many OEMs and Mobile Operators as evidenced by this table at XDA-developers.com({{Web reference|work=HTC Phone Models|title=HTC Phone Models|URL=http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=HTC_PhoneModels}}).

==Conclusion==
By gathering what JVMs are being used in these devices either by HTC information or the JVM OMEs themselves one can determine the optional J2ME APIs that can be accessed.   The minimum configuration seems to be MIDP 2.0/CLDC 1.0 and JTWI 1.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are familiar with some basic microeconomics, particularly the demand and supply curves, this section shouldn't be too demanding. &lt;b&gt;Aggregate Demand&lt;/b&gt; or Aggregate Expenditure (abbreviated to '''AD''' and '''AE''' respectively) is essentially the demand curve for goods and services for a ''whole'' economy. There are determinable ''parts'', known as '''components of aggregate demand''', which the next few pages will explain in more detail.

== Components of Aggregate Demand ==
The formula for finding AD is as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;AD = C + I + G + X - M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Consumption (C) ===
This is the expenditure by consumer on goods and services, including both durable and non-durable goods but not including ''saving''. While values vary widely between economies, 'C' usually accounts for 40-60% of GDP. Because of this, high or low consumer confidence, and consequently high or low consumer spending can change the course in an economy.

=== Investment (I) ===
Strictly known as '''Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation''', this is the money spent by firms ('''not''' the government or consumers) on capital investment ie. new machinery and factories. There is some argument as to whether ''human capital'' (training) should be included. Investment also includes stocks and goods and services not yet completed; for example, car firms will likely have many machines part-built or stored at any one time. Since they cannot be included in consumption since they have not been purchased, stores must be included in I.

Investment makes up approximately 10% of GDP in most economies, and governments are often keen to increase this value, as investment helps to increase the possible output of economy (strictly LRAS or the PPF).

=== Government Spending (G) ===
Strictly known as '''General Government Final Consumption''', it is the expenditure by the government, not including transfer payments (eg. social security, welfare benefits since they are simply moving money around the economy). Governments usually spend on public and merit goods. These are microeconomic terms - a public good is one that is provided to everybody and cannot be exclusive by its nature (think street lighting), whilst a merit good is one that is under-supplied and under-demanded as consumers do not appreciate all the benefits, because some of those benefits do not directly apply to the buyer (think environmentally friendly vehicles).

Changes in government spending as a method of controlling the economy is known as fiscal policy - more of that later on.

=== Exports and Imports (X-M) ===
Exports are a positive figure on Aggregate Demand as overseas customers purchase goods and services produced here. Imports, on the other hand, are not produced here, though they are consumed here. Think of imports as money leaving the economy.

== Aggregate Demand Curve ==
''diagrams!''
=== Shifting the AD Curve ===
Shifting of the AD curve occurs when there is any change in any of the four components of Total Expenditure, i.e., C, I, G or (X-M). If there is an increase in Total Expenditure then the Aggregate Demand Curve shifts rightwards. Again, when there is a decline in total expenditure, the aggregate demand curve shifts leftwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Beekeeping entrance reducer.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden Entance Reducer]]

==Usage==
Entrance reducers have several purposes including controlling traffic, temperature and ventilation within a hive. Most commonly, entrance reducers are only used for new or low population colonies, weak colonies, or during times of low temperature.
Store bought entrance reducers are nothing more than wooden cleats with two varying sized notches, one on each plane. Entrance reducers are designed so that when sandwiched between the [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| bottom board]] and the lower [[Beekeeping/Hive Body| hive body]], a narrow entrance and exit port is created. By rotating the entrance reducer 90&amp;deg; vertically a different sized notch, and there by a different sized exit is used. Finally a hive can be completely opened by removing the entrance reducer altogether. Traditionally the size of the notch used is dependant on the traffic belonging to the hive. As more bees that are coming and going, the size of the entrance should be increased.

==Selecting an Entrance Reducer==
There does not exist mass variation between entrance reducers that are available for purchase. However, some keepers forgo the added (minimal) cost and simply use grass or rags to close a hive's entrance.

==Purchasing==
Most often, entrance reducers come packed with bottom boards and it is thereby often unnecessary to purchase one separately. Despite this common practice, be sure that an entrance reducer is part of the package deal before you end up with out one.

==Maintenance==
*Entrance reducers may need to be occasionally scraped of [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] but should otherwise not need any real maintenance.
*When not using an entrance reducer in a hive, store it well as to prevent warping or damage.

==Tips==
*Grass, leaves or clean rags can be used if necessary in place of an entrance reducer.
*Some beekeepers choose to varnish or preserve their entrance reducers much like their hive bodies.

[[Image:Plantain chips.jpg|thumb|Plantain chips]]

'''Plantains''' are hard, starchy [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]]s used for cooking, as contrasted with the soft, sweet [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] varieties. Plantains are a staple food in the tropical regions of the world, treated in much the same way as [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es and with a similar neutral flavour and texture when unripe. It is unknown whether plantains were grown in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans.

Ripe plantains can be eaten raw, or they can be used for cooking at any stage of ripeness. Green plantains are firm and starchy and resemble potatoes in flavour. Yellow plantains are still firm and starchy but slightly sweeter. Extremely ripe plantains are black, with a soft deep yellow pulp that is much sweeter than the earlier stages of ripeness. These black plantains can be used in sweet dishes, but they still must be cooked.

Plantains are also dried and ground into flour; banana meal forms an important foodstuff, with the following constituents: water 10.62, albuminoids 3.55, fat 1.15, carbohydrates 81.67 (more than 2/3 starch), fibre 1.15, phosphates 0.26, other salts, 1.60. The sugar is chiefly sucrose. 

Plantain fruit can be brewed into an alcoholic drink. The rootstock which bears the leaves is soft and full of starch just before the flowering period, and it is sometimes used as food in Ethiopia; the young shoots of several species are cooked and eaten.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Bee on Peach Blossom.jpg|thumb|right| Bee on Blossom]]

There are several races of the honeybee. Each of these races has different advantages and disadvantages linked to their original regional background. Each region likely has a differing climate, topography, resources and predators. Because of difference in background, each race of honey bees have evolved slightly in a different manner than their cousins allowing them to better take advantage of their specific situation.
Today the [[#Italian Honey Bee| Italian Honey Bee]] is the most commonly kept honey bee in the United States, conversely the [[#Africanized Honey Bee| Africanized Honey Bee]] is the most feared and illegal to keep in many regions. Fitting somewhere between these two extremes include many of the other races and the [[#Feral Honey Bee| Feral Honey Bee]], though technically not a race in its own, it may be acclimated to the area in which it has been found.
The following is a partial listing of the races of honeybee that may be available to a prospective beekeeper, along side is a brief amount of information regarding each race and some common advantages and disadvantages with each.

==Africanized Honey Bee==
&lt;small&gt;''Apis mellifera scutellata''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The [[w:Africanized bee| Africanized honey bee]], also known as the killer bee. Because of the media attention received, Africanized bees have been given a bad name. This is not to say that they can’t be more dangerous than standard honeybees, their representation has simply been blown out of proportion. There have been several more recent breeding programs that have produced a more gentle form of this race. This gentler form of bee has even become one of the more sought after honeybee races in regions of Brazil.

== Replacing rear wheel ==

Hello

I need to know how to replace the rear wheel. WHile it sounds easy enough (disassembly was brainless -- it almost disassembles itself), the reinstallation (this is after replacing a tube) had problems. There is obviously a right way and a wrong way to install a rear wheel back on to the moped, and I did it the wrong way. I am getting a &quot;ker-chunking&quot; on acceleration that wasn't there before. What should I be looking for, for a proper installation?

BTW, this is an incredible reference. It definitely shows promise.</text>

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: suprising → surprising  [[Project:AutoWikiBrowser|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

A pleasantly-surprising recipe encountered in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]]. Also, a good first attempt for beginning deep-fryers. Makes a good substitute to chips or [[Cookbook:French Fries|fries]].

==Ingredients==

* canned or frozen [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]]  (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==

# If using frozen corn, thaw. If using canned corn, microwave in a glass bowl or gently heat on the stove until warm.
# Coat corn with a light layer of [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]].
# Mix salt and pepper into the flour, [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]] or other [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]] optional.
# Move corn from the egg wash and cover with flour.
# Heat oil to moderate to high heat.
# Deep-fry floured corn until golden brown on the outside (less than two minutes).
# Serve as a complement to another dish

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy. An oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] is less likely to cause problems, including indoor air pollution and fire. See [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|Deep-frying]] for more warnings.

==Variation==
Substitute moderately-chopped [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] and [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] for additional flavors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Design ==
Creating a video game is no simple task, it is the step that requires the most creative effort and artistic vision. This chapter will help you get through it.

=== Thesis ===
;A '''Game''' is defined as: &quot;a recreational activity involving one or more players, defined by 1) a goal that the players try to reach, and 2) some set of rules that determines what the players can do. Games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment, but may also serve an educational or simulational role.&quot;

=== Planning comes first ===
The most important task in any game developing process is having a plan, whether that plan involves using a really well thought-out concept, a basic idea, or going into a full-blown production. Another aspect is that the plan must be possible to implement in software and on available hardware. Gaming platforms and game designs place high and specific requirements on software which differ from the requirements of other software platforms.

==== Be creative... ====
In the gaming industry there is a constant need for [[w:Innovation|innovation]] games with better graphics, better music, better controls, games with new realm, new laws, new types of games. 

But this does not mean every game has to be all new. Innovation can be as simple as new perspective, a new spin on an old idea.

===== Brainstorming =====
[[w:Brainstorming|Brainstorm]]. Think of all the ideas that you can and write them down. (do not worry about good ones yet, keep them all). Then after you have thought of all that you can, eliminate the ones you do not like as much, are impossible, etc. And form a [[w:Concept|concept]] for the video game. For example the concept of Tetris would be: ''Differently shaped blocks fall and you try and line them up on the ground to make lines to get points''.

==== Steps ====
Before we can create a video game that generations can enjoy (or a simple game to amuse friends, yourself, or potential mates), we need to discuss the '''Five ''W'''s of Development.'''

* Why
What is the purpose of developing this game?
* Who
Who will be the actor? Who is our target audience? Who do we care to entertain, frustrate, puzzle?
* What
What is the point of the game? What Type of game is it? What is the objective ?
* When
How long will it take to complete the plot ? 
* Where
Where can the game be played?

'''Practical application'''
Sometimes one can learn as much from a bad example as a good example.

===== WHY: Purpose for the video game =====
While designing your game consider your purpose for creating the game. Is it because you enjoy making games, or because you want to make a lot of money? Think about the audience who you are going to be selling this to, is that their purpose for playing the game? To spend lots of money or because they enjoy playing games? You should have at least some idea of the replies to these question before you can proceed constructively toward your goal.

===== WHO: Market considerations =====
Since you will be designing a game for other to play, having a consideration on the design to what market you are producing is extremely important. Who are you marketing it to? Teenagers? Little girls? What must you do to market it to that group? What are that group interests ? Where do you have less competition? What are your target audience interested in?

===== WHO: Understand the player =====
Almost every game requires a type of strategy toward gaining control of the motivator (the reason for committing to play). The logical reasoning, and generated optimal strategies normally used in game play are mathematically described and psychologically studied by the science of [[w:Game theory|Game Theory]]. The Wikibook [[Introduction to Game Theory]] tries to cover the subject in greater depth, but anyone creating any type of game that involves complex decision processes should have at least a passing knowledge on this subject.

Players can be classified in four major classes that are not mutually exclusive but one will have predominance over the other, the player will be:
*Competitor
*Achiever
*Explorer
*Socializer

====== Gender orientation ====== 
It is scientifically proven that video games tend to activate the reward regions of brains. While differently in males and females, since gender is also characterized by specific preferences and mental predisposition, this fact explains why males are more attracted to, and more likely to become &quot;hooked&quot; on video games than females, especially since video games are themselves generally oriented towards male players.  

Males are visual oriented and more attracted to technology, mechanical complexity (note that while video games are coded using algorithms and represented in virtualized form, a majority of games can be defined replicating mechanical constructs). Most of the computer games that are really popular with males are the ones that simulate tasks and goals that are similar to the real world preferences (challenges of performance, conquest, enabling obtaining ranks or establish a stratified collaboration team or promote status even if only in the virtual word). 

Females on the other hand are more emotional oriented, tend to be more inclined to games that promote or simulate social interaction among equals and will be more opened to tackle games that will have more complex plot lines and a higher level of complexity of interactions running at the same time.

Creating a game that caters to both genders would probably be an impossible task, in this case other fields of culture also can serve as a guideline. For instance, consider how genders deal differently with movies and books. In games things are not that different - only richer and with a greater level of freedom of implementation. As an example, a book author will not have to deal with color schemes (not considering the cover). Art is only an imitation of life.

===== WHAT: Goals and objectives =====
As any other task a game has to have a goal or a objective and those must be clear (or seem so) to the player.

===== WHERE: Technical requirements =====
Before you start to conceptualize the game you must establish the initial technical requirements available. See what technologies can be used, determine the target platform and the time for the implementation.

Some of the requirements may create a bottleneck for the implementation, others my require that you create or change normal tools or other parts of what would normally be the framework for the implementation. This can often not be known before you start your game design, and not all games designs are created for immediate implementation, they can often be stored for future use when a technology is available or the license prices, production team or implementation is right.

So, technical requirement are most often mutable and unpredictable, but a required consideration for the design stage.

==== A note about gamification ====
Gamification is simply described as the merge of non-leisure activities with games. 

{{TODO|Mine [[wikipedia:Gamification]], show points about (enterprise vs player) goals and the initial attempt to trick people and the benefit of transparency, NASA and Folding at home examples.}}

==== Games as a learning medium ====
Games can be easily turned into learning platforms, finding the right approach to turn a game experience into a learning one (or an aid to consolidate knowledge) it the trick that permits games that teach. Game and learning are inseparable from the start, the act of playing a game is the act of becoming proficient in the games rules and to attempt to excel in its uses in a competitive way. As all the things that humans like patterns are at the top, we are attracted by logic sets and combinations in any form. Patternization and the automation of those patterns is what our brains do best. Games are very prone to help us not only to build what we define as muscular memory (automated responses) but go beyond to deep learning of abstract concepts without the need of extensive formalisms required for class room format.     

{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Design Phase ===
[[Image:Leonardo_Design_for_a_Flying_Machine,_c._1505.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Cover: A Da Vinci sketch of a flying machine. ]]

When you have your concept, expand it. Using the Tetris example again, think about the shapes of the blocks, how many points things are worth. Consider the '''Theory''' discussed earlier in the book, what is the character-player relationship? What is the character's role? What is the challenge, what is the risk? What is the reward? What could be lost? What is the realm?

When designing the levels consider what was discussed on ''difficulty'' and challenge. If it is too hard before the player has been able to gain logic and skill in the realm, the player will not want to play. And if the game is too easy, same thing. Consider how challenging elements of a level are, do the rewards of the levels outweigh the loss or is it too easy to die?

==== Moral and ethical considerations ====
Moral and ethics can be important elements in defining the game concept as they help to exclude unacceptable ideas not only to the creator but to the player or the community that will be impacted by the game distribution. Today we have probably a heightened sense of protection for the society in general and children in particular, sometimes beyond what is reasonably acceptable, so determining limits to what should and should not be covered will definitely help in planning.

===== Addiction =====
The psychology study of behavioral addiction, has not generated yet enough scientific research to claim that video games are addictive in nature, that is generate an [[w:Addiction|addiction]].

Note however that gambling addiction (ludomania), pathological gambling, is considered to be an impulse control disorder similar to many other impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania and is therefore not considered by the [[w:American Psychological Association|American Psychological Association]] to be an addiction. 

While there is a possibility that video games can be addictive, they are structural different from other forms of what is normally classified as addictive activities. For instance when dealing with substance abuse the addiction is created by the body's dependence on the drug, if we translate this into the area of video games we can only define two types of substances that can create a modest addiction, endorphins and adrenaline, and video games are not the best or the only way to obtain a &quot;fix&quot; of those substances, even if a person begins to crave for the biological sensation these natural substances generate, a video game will tend not to provide them with enough consistency and strength to really create an addiction, making the player unable to cope without the substance, it can however reinforce and generate a [[w:Compulsive behavior|compulsive behavior]].

{{NOTE|For instance smokings creates both an addiction to [[w:Nicotine|nicotine]] and compulsive behavior.}}

===== Compulsion =====
Video game compulsion is very similar to, [[w:Problem gambling|problem gambling]] even if not so rapid and destructive, if we look at the media or art that are similar and even utilized in video games, like images, music or plot, most games would have the same risk of creating an addiction that a good movie, a book or your favorite painting. 

So the issue must be centered in the game mechanics, presentation and the environment surrounding the activity. The emotional and social framework around playing any type of game in general, peer acceptance, reputation, etc. become factors that act as promoters for the activity and reinforce the compulsion.

In the case of compulsion, the psychological need to do an action, there the video game can have relevance, depending on the social structure of the player. If there was improper emotional development, substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, or personality disorders then most of these problems could also contribute to an isolation and detachment from normal society. This is also common with Internet addiction, that in fact is a psychological craving to be in the communal action, be informed and participative.

Video games that are played over the Internet would better come under the same issues, but it is not a general problem of games, but a result of the psychological fragility of the person/player and the general state of society. One can not specifically blame games, and not all persons will be at the same level of susceptibility.

====== Compulsive presentations and games mechanics ======
Several video game creators, including [[w:Shigeru Miyamoto|Shigeru Miyamoto]], have stepped up and denounced the practice of creating games around compulsive rewarding mechanics, labeled as &quot;carrot and the stick&quot; called such mechanics unethical.

Compulsion can be avoided by limiting repetitive patterns in games, but of course some game creators seek actively to reinforce the compulsive behavior. Sadly this is becoming a fad especially in many Internet activities, including games that depend in continued play for revenue or even social networks that simply require continued participation.

==== Examine the competition ====
Part of the process should include a look on the availing offering similar to what you are intending to create, have references and solidify your expectations.

==== Contextualize ====
For a game to be attractive and engaging its actions need to take place in an as rich as possible environment. One must chose between two poles, realism and the absurd, the mixing of the two must be done with artful understanding of the comic and ironic.

Context is the background universe of the game, it is all the extras that are not themselves a requirement for the gameplay. Some universes where the plot takes place are not possible to seem realistic at all, therefore one must not try to go beyond what is necessary to keep the player interested and its actions significant in that specific context.

A dynamic universe will often increase the game replay value on its own, since at each attempt the player will have the chance of discovering and observe something new, even if it does not have a direct impact on the gameplay it will be in itself rewarding.

The created context for the gameplay must fit the game's objectives and not the other way around, if the game is simple it will not require a complex background but as gameplay complexity increases the right context must be provided as to sustain the player motivation for continued engagement.

Context has the main purpose of activating and then conforming to the player's imagination, in this cultural background is an important consideration. This task can be archived by the use of images, sound and a good story.

==== Narrative ====
If the ''objective'' is the point of the game, what you are trying to accomplish, the narrative is what drives the player to attempt to archive it, it provides not only the reason for the player actions but creates all the environment were they are to be performed serves to move the player along the game.

Some game types are elusively dependent on the interactive narration. That is the game evolution or experience is a partnership between the game designer and the player.

'''Story telling (the plot)'''&lt;br&gt;
All games do not necessarily have the &quot;once upon a time...&quot; plot, however, in every game there is a narrative of sorts. For one thing ''every'' game has an objective. This objective can be simple as making a line to get points in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris Tetris] or as complicated as saving the princess in Zelda.

In Tetris you move from level to level in chronological order according to the finishing of prior levels. In games with a story line, the plot is the storyline. The narrative is important to the player as it gives them a sense of ''progression''.

The first step to any successful game is to have a great, or as close as you can came up to it, is the narrative, since the goal can be less than the road that needs to be traveled. This is why 3D games sell so well, even if most of them does not deliver anything really innovative. If you produce a great visual show with distracting shiny visuals people forget to look for a plot or can even be made to like absurd things that any marketing researcher would bet his life on that you should not include on your masterwork. Before you make any game, you should first ask yourself &quot;Is this game fun? Would I want to play my game?&quot; What would the point of making a game if you do not think your own game is fun? Think what type of game YOU would want to play. It is also a good idea to start small. If your first project is to make the next Halo, or 3d MMO you will probably fail miserably. Start with something simple like PONG, and work your way up from there.

More complex games my require a richer environment to captivate the gamer, writing game stories today may be even more complex than writing the next blockbuster scrip. There are even conferences for innovative storytelling in computer games. (See for instance [http://stagconf.com/ StagConf]).

Building a workable plot, is very similar to writing a movie script, you will need hooks and a good story telling capability, to get the player involved into the action.

{{TODO|There are some Wikibooks covering writing and movies, this could probably be referenced and even have content mined for this section.}}

'''Sequel Sickness'''&lt;br&gt;
Sequel Sickness is contagious, Hollywood has it, and so does the gaming industry. Often times, developers will see that a game has done outstanding and decide to make a sequel. Now, sequels are not inherently bad, however they usually turn out to be.

When developing a sequel, remember that it has a lot to live up to. ''A sequel must be as good as or better than the previous game'' and you should only make the sequel if ''it has something to add to the original''. 

A sequel that does not live up to its predecessor can ruin both (or all) the games in a series. So be careful.

'''The Mime Syndrome'''&lt;br&gt;
Another illness comes from Hollywood too. The Mime Syndrome is where game developers try to make a game based off a movie or a book. Usually the game precisely mimics the movie or book so the plot has already been experienced by the player - what is the point?

Movie games usually tear a movie/book apart using the generic ''movie game template'' where they take the movie/book putting in apathetic collectibles, and plot points. If you ever make a game based off a movie or book consider what it really is, what it means to its fans - how are avid players going to feel about the game based off of it? And do not just copy the movie/book if the players wanted that - they would just go read the book or watch the movie. Come up with your own plot points within the style of the media you are creating the book from and do not just roll out another cheap movie game. Remember, most movie/book games result in failure in the market, only few actually succeed.

If you cannot be cured of Mime Syndrome, do not make a movie/book game.

===== Level design =====

==== Playability ==== 
An important aspect of any game is good gameplay. You could have the best looking and sounding game on the planet but if the gameplay is bad, it will be a bad game and no one will want to play it. A good game always has a creative hook. It has to be a game that players will want to play. It may have a creative story, with many plot twists. But what makes some computer games so addictive? Why do so many of us spend countless hours sitting, our eyes stuck on a computer screen? 

There are so many answers to these questions that several (very heavy) books could be written on the subject. People like to have fun, but have different tastes and thus different definitions of &quot;fun&quot;. To Carl, mowing the lawn may be &quot;fun&quot;, while Ryan may find it a complete bore. You see, fun is not simply &quot;goofing off&quot;. You can have fun doing something constructive. Anything you find enjoyable can be described as &quot;fun&quot;.

==== Progression &amp; Achievement ==== 
The feeling of achievement of progress should hinge in mastering the game mechanics.

====== Fairness ======
The sense of fairness is extremely important, especially when competing with other human players, noting that an AI is cheating, if too obvious can also be extremely vexing even if to a small degree excusable and even expected (depending on the game type).

{{TODO|Examples, link to artificial intelligence and balancing of game mechanics, to the challenge factor and issues in marketing good games with lousy opponents.}}

====== Replay value ======
{{TODO|Create a clear distinction between replay (start over) and continued interests, they are not the same and distinct in relation to game types.}}

Replay Value is the value of starting over and playing the game again (or continuing playing) after you have already finished playing the game. If the game is only playable once, then it really is not worth much, is it? The sign of a truly superb game is one you can play over and over again, whether you continue on beyond the plot through mini-games and side-quests or you simply start it completely over.

Some aspects that give a game replay value (besides just being really well done) are mini-games, side-quests, challenges that go beyond the scope of the plot (find all the... to get...), unlockables, and so forth.

'''Mini-games'''
A mini-game is a 'game within a game'. Usually these are arcade-like games such as racing, puzzles, and so forth. The Zelda series incorporates mini-games in Ocarina of Time with archery, fishing, and so forth. The challenge to get the highest score possible in a mini-game is a good motivator for replay.

'''Unlockables'''
An unlockable is some type of reward that the player can unlock by doing something (such as getting all the... or finding the...). These can be very helpful in increasing replay value.

==== Innovation ====
Breaking new grounds in the creation of video games be it technology, or concept can be a high point for your production, it can make your game pop out among similar offerings and even create specific niche where no other product will be competing with your creation. 

Innovation in game concept is often interlinked with the creation of new technology, this is not at all a requirement but is often necessary to create get deeper into the framework to provide the features required for the implementation. This can also create a new revenue stream, for instance if you create a specific engine or technology that can be relicensed to other creators.

The danger of going out of the box is that it can also break playability or reduce the target market in a way that will restrict adoption by the public, this is a thin line that must be carefully considered.

==== Composition ====
This is one of the final steps of the game design process, it is the critical analysis on how well each game component fits into the design and how best to tweak its use.

'''Style consistency'''&lt;br&gt;
Remember to keep all the graphics, sound, and gameplay in the same style. Something painted by Picasso would NOT look the same as something painted by Davinci. Make sure that everything is stylized similarly - do not mix Picasso and Davinci.

*'''Experimental antibody based methods''' - alpha emitters
:At the ITU (Institute for Transuranium Research; [http://itu.jrc.cec.eu.int/ website]) work is being done on Alpha-Immunotherapy, an experimental method using antibodies bound to alpha isotopes. [[w:Bismuth|Bismuth]]-213 is one of the isotopes which has been used. This is made by the alpha decay of Ac-225. The generation of one shortlived isotope from longer lived isotope is a useful method of providing a portable supply of a shortlived isotope. This is similar to the generation of [[w:technetium|technetium]]-99m by a [[w:technetium cow|technetium cow]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavTechnique}}
== Transposition ==
Many older pieces for horn were written for a horn not keyed in F as is standard today. As a result, a requirement for modern horn players is to be able to read music in other keys. This is most commonly done by transposing the music &quot;on the fly&quot; into F. A reliable way to transpose is to liken the written notes (which rarely deviate from written C, D, E, and G) to their counterparts in the scale the F horn will be playing in.
Commonly seen transpositions include:
* '''B&amp;#x266d; alto''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:perfect fourth|perfect fourth]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''A alto''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:major third|major third]]
* '''G''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:major second|major second]]
* '''E''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor second|minor second]]
* '''E&amp;#x266d;''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:major second|major second]] &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''D''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor third|minor third]]
* '''C''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:perfect fourth|perfect fourth]]
* '''B&amp;#x266d; basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:perfect fifth|perfect fifth]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Some less common transpositions include:
* '''A&amp;#x266d; alto''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:minor third|minor third]]
* '''G&amp;#x266d;''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:minor second|minor second]]
* '''D&amp;#x266d;''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:major third|major third]] (used in some works by [[Wikipedia:Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Wikipedia:Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Wikipedia:Richard Strauss|Strauss]] (Der Rosenkavalier))
* '''B''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:tritone|tritone]] (used by Brahms) &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''A basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor sixth|minor sixth]] (used in some works by Verdi)
* '''A&amp;#x266d; basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:major sixth|major sixth]] (used in some works by Verdi)
* '''G basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor seventh|minor seventh]] (used in some works by Verdi)

It has been speculated that one of the reasons Brahms wrote for horn in the awkward key of B was to encourage the horns to use the natural horn; he did not like the sound of the new valved horns. An example of this is when Brahms picked the second horn player, Wilhelm Kleinecke, in the Vienna Opera for a performance of the Horn Trio in E flat, op. 40 over the first horn, Richard Lewy, because Lewy only played the valved horn. [http://www.osmun.com/reference/brahms/Title_Page.html]

Sometimes it is ambiguous whether a piece should be transposed up or down (i.e. B&amp;#x266d; alto versus B&amp;#x266d; basso when only B&amp;#x266d; is written). It is usually safe to assume that the most common and reasonable transposition is the intended transposition (i.e. it stays in the normal horn range). More can be decided from the history of the composer. For example, Verdi and other opera composers used many low and odd transpositions. For Haydn symphonies that have trumpets, the lower transposition for the horns is usually correct; otherwise the high transposition is usually correct. After gaining much experience, this decision-making should come easily to the horn player.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''In older scores (many times German), B&amp;#x266d; alto and basso are written simply as &quot;B.&quot;''

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''E&amp;#x266d; horns were used extensively in military bands in the early 20th century, therefore band parts written for chromatic E&amp;#x266d; horns are common.''

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ''Brahms indicated the key of B as &quot;H.&quot;''

== Learning to Transpose ==

Many ideas are out there as to how to think of transposing. Here a few are presented. Pick the ones that work for you and use them. In the end, knowing what note to play is what is important.

=== Note by Note ===
Once you figure out how far you need to transpose, just think that in your head for every note. For example, for D horn you need to transpose every note down a minor third (three half steps). When you come to a third space C, you think a minor third below that and play an A.

=== Clef Transposition ===
Pretend the written music has a different clef. &lt;!--Flesh this out --&gt;

=== Tricks ===
* B&amp;#x266d; Horn - If you have a double horn, as most people do, you can use F horn fingerings on the B&amp;#x266d; side of the horn. This does not work for all fingerings, but if you are in doubt, it can come in handy.

* C Horn - This is similar to B&amp;#x266d; horn, but instead use B&amp;#x266d; fingerings on the F side of the horn. Again this is not fool-proof and does not work for all fingerings.

== Old Notation ==

Old Notation was the practice of notating bass clef Horn parts a fourth BELOW sounding pitch instead of a fifth ABOVE sounding pitch, which is the standard today.  

These parts should be played an octave above the written pitch.  A good indicator of old notation is the presence of a pedal C (C2) or lower.  

In modern composition, old notation should never be used.  It is outdated and unnecessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several types of saws for cutting wood. Some are used to make straight cuts and others are used to make curved cuts.

The two main types of handsaws in the western world are the crosscut saw and the ripsaw. The teeth on a ripsaw are like a row of chisels, each used to sever a fiber of wood as they pass parallel to the grain.  The teeth on a crosscut saw are like a row of knives, each used to slice across the wood fiber as they pass perpendicular to the grain.  As its name suggests, a crosscut saw is used to cut wood perpendicular or at an angle to the wood grain.  The crosscut saw typically has more teeth per inch than the ripsaw.  A crosscut saw can also be used to cut plywood. The ripsaw is only used to cut wood in the same direction as the grain. The ripsaw makes a very rough and ragged cut when used to cut across the grain. The crosscut saw is a better all-purpose saw since you can cut with or against the grain. Although it can tend to follow the wood grain and make it harder to make a straight cut with the grain.

Both of these western handsaws cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws, on the other hand, cut on the pull stroke. The advantage of the Japanese saw is the width of the blade can be much thinner because you are using the steel in tension. Western style saws are much thicker because they will buckle if they are too thin.  An exception is the backsaw used by cabinetmakers. This saw has a very thin blade with a high tooth count (for cleaner cuts) and a stiffener across the top of the blade to keep it from buckling.

The compass or keyhole saw is a short, narrow-bladed crosscut saw used for getting into tight spaces or for making circular cuts 

The coping or fret saw has a narrow fine-toothed blade held in a c-shaped body and is used to make circular cuts and to for cope (trim) molding to fit snugly.

The hacksaw has a very fine-toothed, narrow blade and is used for cutting through metals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Correspondence Learning==
The student receives a set of learning materials via mail. The traditional set included textbooks, student guides, and assignments that the student is obliged to do within the specified time. No teacher support is provided. Later this form of learning is combined with the educational radio and TV programs. But in general this form of learning doesn't include any kind of feedback and communication with other participants of the educational process. At those times students and teachers saw each other only within exam sessions.

Traditional correspondence education assumes that learners should work with various educational materials received by the mail. The learner also should send back written assignments and results of his individual research activities.

{{spice}}

'''Marjoram''' is a cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavors. It is also called sweet marjoram or knotted marjoram.

Marjoram's aromatic leaves are used either green or dry for culinary purposes; the tops are cut as the plants begin to flower and are dried slowly in the shade. It is often used in herb combinations such as Herbes de Provence and [[Cookbook:Za'atar|Za'atar]].

Marjoram is very similar to [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], a herb from the same family. Oregano is stronger in flavour, marjoram is sweeter and milder. If a recipe requires marjoram, you may substitute oregano for it, but only use ⅔ as much as the recipe states.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Broadcasting Courses==
The TV and radio broadcasting for educational purposes is widely used for teaching. Very often TV programs are integrated into the curriculum in addition to the existing face-to-face educational programs (for example, taped demonstration of the lectures of the famous scientists, Nobel prize laureates, etc). The feedback is organized in a form of the e-mail and asynchronous conferences. Students receive the help from the teachers, and send them back the reports about the on-going projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Companies are using TV broadcasting more to broadcast open forum or town hall meetings as a type of seminar course. The seminars are live and allow for Q&amp;A session between the differant locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)==
Having a personal computer at home the student could learn the subject by various interactive educational software programs, that are delivered in most cases in a form of an educational toolkit with software and courseware materials (textbooks, guides for self-instruction, learning tools, etc). The student could work with these materials at his home computer, or could get the access to the same educational resources, but published on the appropriate Internet web site. Distance education supported by educational software programs could be the part of the traditional educational process or the dominating form of education, organized, for instance, in a form of so-called learning environments, or learning spaces, virtual laboratories, etc. As a rule, the feedback in such cases is provided by e-mail and teleconferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This form of distance education could be developed in the Internet environment with the help of the interactive Web-based textbooks, e-mail, mailing lists, chats, asynchronous forums, computer modeling and simulation programs, etc. Teaching on the Net could be integrated with other forms and methods of distance teaching, enlisted above (for example, with broadcasting courses).

There are several types of web courses that refer to the various levels that they are used within the web that should be pointed out.

o A '''web-presence''' course would have all the general information about the course but does not provide any instruction.

o A '''web-enhanced''' course will take advantage of the web technology to distribute the course materials.

o The '''web-centric''' course makes more use of the web technology for greater access and interaction to course materials and even communications between teacher-to-students, student-to-student.

o Full '''web-courses''' can be accessed anywhere and anytime. These courses take full advantage of web technology for communication and interaction between teacher, students, and course materials 

In her monograph [[http://www.pfhe.org/institute/twigg/]], &quot;Innovations in Online Learning: Moving Beyond No Significant Difference,&quot; Dr. Carol A. Twigg says that web-based distance learning can run the gamut from &quot;teacher-led distance learning programs... to more innovative, learner-centered programs that rely on a combination of high quality, interactive learningware, asynchronous and synchronous conversations, and individualized mentoring...&quot;

'''Dill''' is a short-lived, European, annual herb. Both the fern-like leaves and the seed are used.

Dill leaves (called '''dill weed''') are used to flavor many foods, such as [[Cookbook:Borscht|borscht]] and [[Cookbook:Gravlax|gravlax]]. It is a popular herb used in various ways with [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], and works well with [[Cookbook:Cream|creamy]] [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]].

'''Dill seeds''' can be used much like [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]] and [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] seeds, sprinkled over [[Cookbook:Casserole|casseroles]] and [[Cookbook:Bread|breads]], and in [[Cookbook:Salad|salad dressings]]. Dill seed has long been used to make teas for helping with digestive problems.

Both the seeds and the leaves are commonly used to flavor [[Cookbook:Pickle|cucumber pickles]].

'''Cardamom''' is a pungent aromatic spice. The green seed pods of the plant are dried and the seeds inside the pod are used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian]] cuisine either whole or in a ground form. Ground cardamom is a primary ingredient of curry powder. In the Middle East, cardamom is used to flavour coffee or tea.

Cardamom can also be spelled cardamon or cardomom and in India is popularly known as elaichi.

'''Cloves''' are the aromatic dried buds of a tree native to Indonesia, used as a spice in virtually all the world's cuisine. They can be used in cooking either whole or in a ground form, but they are extremely strong so they are used sparingly. 

One use of cloves is as flavouring in stewed [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

When I first saw this wikibook, and all the edits, I thought it would be a great rescource for Learning languages autonomously using machines.  It's not.  It's basically a guide to the internet.  If you want to put a guide to the internet, make a wikibook called... Internet Guide.  Not ATALL.

----
The Internet is certainly a large part of ATALL.  But ATALL is not limited to the Internet.  There is information here (and will be more) on radio, TV, DVD movies, MP3 players, telephone and other forms of non-Internet technology as well.

== Orphaned Wikibook module ==

The following is a module that may have some connection to this Wikibook:

*[[Introduction to Rich Internet Applications for ATALL]]

If it doesn't seem to fit here, you can either try to find a better fitting Wikibook (unlikely, but possible) or simply tag it for deletion by inserting the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|Wikibook cleanup}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to let the admins know that it is something that should be looked at closer.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:15, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

== Further quotes in the sequence ==

:'''''Give a teacher a way to teach students to become autonomous technology-assisted language learners, and you teach them and their students for a lifetime. Write a computer program to give the teachers the same skills, and it may or may not end up being less work.''''' (Anonymous, 2006)

== Vokaler ~ Vowels ==

There are nine vowels in the Danish/Norwegian alphabet, '''a''', '''e''', '''i''',
'''o''', '''u''', '''y''', '''æ''', '''ø''' and '''å'''. For people who only speak English they are often not pronounced quite the way you would expect.

The five first vowels are pronounced as in most European languages other than
English. 

* '''a''' is pronounced almost as the English '''a'''
* '''i''' is pronounced as '''ee''' in '''bee''' or the '''e''' in '''R''e''ba'''.
* '''y''' is pronounced as '''ee''' in '''bee''' but with rounded lips. This sound does not occur in English, but it's similar to the French ''t'''u''''' or German '''ü'''.
* '''æ''' is pronounced 1) as in ''h'''a'''t'' or 2) as in '''''a'''ny'' or '''''e'''nd''.
* '''ø''' is pronounced as in '''''ea'''rn'' or ''h'''ur'''t''.
* '''å''' is pronounced 1) as '''''awe''''' and '''''or''''' or 2) sort of like as in ''n'''o''''' or ''l'''o'''w''.

It is important to distinguish between ''long'' and ''short'' 
vowels. A short vowel is often indicated by doubling the consonant ''after'' 
it. 
&lt;!-- An example would be nice here. But the Norwegian does not work in Danish
For example '''hat''' with a long '''a''' means ''hate'', while '''hatt'''
with a short '''a''' means ''hat''.--&gt;

For instance '''skulle''' with a short '''u''' means '''should''', but '''at skule''' means '''to stare'''. '''Pile''' means '''darts''', but '''pille''' means '''pill'''.

== Konsonanter ~ Consonants ==

'''b''', '''f''', '''h''', '''k''', '''l''', '''m''', '''n''',
'''p''', '''s''', '''t''' and '''v''' are pronounced more or less as in
English.

*'''d''' is silent if found after an ''n'', as in ''hen'''d'''e''. If doubled in the middle of a word, as in ''he'''dd'''er'', it is pronounced as ''th'' in the English '''''th'''e'' or ''te'''th'''er''. The '''d''' can also take on the sound of a hard d, &quot;at '''d'''ykke&quot; (meaning, &quot;to '''d'''ive&quot; where the '''d''''s are pronounced the same).
*'''g''' is usually pronounced as in '''''g'''uess''. Sometimes pronounced as a soft ''g'' if the word is of foreign origin, for example: ''teenagere''
*'''j''' is pronounced as the ''y'' in '''''y'''es''.


'''c''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''' and '''z''' are mainly used in foreign words.

*'''c''' is pronounced as '''s''' when it comes before '''e''', '''i''', '''y''' and '''æ''', and as '''k''' in all other cases. (Exception: '''Cypern''' (meaning '''Cyprus''') is pronounced with a '''k''' sound))

*'''q''' is pronounced as '''k'''.

*'''w''' is pronounced as '''v''' (never as English ''w''.)

*'''x''' is pronounced as '''s''' if it is the ''first'' letter in a word and is pronounced as '''ks''' if it is ''not''.

*'''z''' is pronounced as '''s'''. 

*'''r''' is pronounced almost as French/German '''r''' but more &quot;smoothe&quot;, without the vibrating sound.

Note that Danish does not have the voiced ''z''-sound, so Danish '''s''', '''x''' and '''z''' are never pronounced as in English ''is'', ''example'' or ''zoo''.


Eksempler ~ Examples:

''xylofon''  ('''x''' pronounced like '''s''')

''fox''  ('''x''' pronounced like '''ks''')

'''Saffron''' is the dried stigma and part of the style of the saffron crocus. It has a pleasant spicy smell, and it contains a dye that colours food a distinctive deep golden colour. It is one of the most expensive of all spices, because of the labour-intensive way it is prepared. Saffron has been described as metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes, while its taste has been noted also as hay-like and somewhat bitter. Saffron contributes a luminous yellow-orange colour to whatever you put it in. 

Saffron is used in many [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] recipes, including [[Cookbook:Paella|paella]] and [[Cookbook:Fabada Asturiana|fabada Asturiana]], and in the most famous saffron-based [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dish, the [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]] alla milanese. Outside Europe, it is a vital ingredient of many [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South and Central Asian]], and [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Arabian]] dishes. 

[[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]] is sometimes used as a substitute; although it gives a similar colour, it has none of the real saffron taste. 

==Preparation==

Saffron should always be soaked in hot (not boiling) water before use, about three times as much water as saffron. If you have the time, it is best to soak the whole saffron strands for about 2 hours. Otherwise, soak for at least 20 minutes, then crush the strands of saffron with the back of a spoon, to release the flavours and colour in to the water. Add the saffron and soak water to the rest of the ingredients, as directed by the recipe.

[[Image:Salvia officinalis2.jpg|200px|thumb|Sage leaves]]
'''Sage''' is a herb, the leaf of a perennial plant that can be grown in most climates.

It has a slight peppery flavour and in Western cooking it is used for flavouring fatty meats (especially as part of a [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinade]]), [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]], and some drinks. In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Belgium|Flanders]], sage is used with [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] for [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|poultry]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Stuffing|stuffing]] and also in sauces. In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]], sage is used for cooking white meat and in vegetable soups. [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germans]] often use it in sausage dishes. Sage is also common in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian cooking]]. In the Balkans and the Middle East, it is used when roasting [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]].

Whole branches of sage may be laid in the bottom of a roasting pan when [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] chicken and other meats, to prevent the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pan. The sage then imparts its flavour to the meat, and other items in the oven. The pan drippings are also infused with sage, making for a delicious [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]].

      <comment>/* Present Tense Conjugations 1, 2 and 3 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In Italian, most verbs end in a common pattern, such as '''-are''', '''-ere''', and '''-ire'''. These are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd conjugations respectively.

==Present tense (Presente indicativo)==

The present tense in Italian is essentially the same as in English. The only difference is that it can also be used as the present continuous, so &quot;I do&quot; and &quot;I am doing&quot; are conjugated the same way. The English present continuous, however, is expressed in a better way by a more complex construction with the verb &quot;stare&quot; and the &quot;gerundio&quot; form (the English -ing form).

Also note that the subject pronoun can be dropped from a conjugated verb because the ending of the conjugated verb communicates the subject of the action.

====Present Tense Conjugations 1, 2 and 3====
{{expand}}{{confusing|what is 1, 2 and 3?}}
Category 1 words in the infinitive end in ARE:for example parlare (to speak), gioccare (to play), amare (to love) and so on.
Similarly, category 2 words in the infinitive end in ERE: vendere (to sell), vedere (to see).
Category 3 words in the infinitive end in IRE. There two (2) subcategories of this case: those requiring no special treatment and those 
requiring an ISC be inserted prior to inserting the ending. Some authors have classified the second subcategory as class 3 and the first
subcategory as class 4, thus reclassifying to 4 cases. 
Using this method, in class 3 we have: capire (to understand), finire (to finish),preferire (to prefer)
and in class 4 we have: sentire (to feel),dormire (to sleep)  
To conjugate regular verbs follow this method:

# Drop the ending from the infinitive to give the stem.&lt;br&gt;Eg.: ''lavorare (to work) → lavor-''&lt;br&gt;
# Add the correct ending:&lt;br&gt;Eg.: ''lavorare → lavor- → lavoro''

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!person !! -are !! -ere !! -ire
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| 
|-
| io || -o || -o || -o 
|-
| tu || -i || -i || -i 
|-
| lui/lei || -a || -e || -e 
|-
| noi || -iamo || -iamo || -iamo 
|-
| voi || -ate || -ete || -ite 
|-
| loro || -ano || -ono || -ono
|-
|}


So, for example, ''parlare'' (to speak) would be conjugated as follows:

:(Io) parlo (&quot;I speak / am speaking&quot;)
:(Tu) parli (&quot;You speak / you are speaking&quot;)
:(Egli/ella/Lei/Lui) parla
:(Noi) parliamo
:(Voi) parlate
:(Essi/Loro) parlano

Note:  Words ''egli'', ''ella'', and ''essi'' are older versions of ''lui'', ''lei'', and ''loro'', respectively, but are still used occasionally today.

====3rd Conjugation Verbs taking &quot;-isc-&quot;====

Many 3rd Conjugation verbs add the letters '''-isc-''' between the stem and the ending for the present tense. This is constructed as follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!person !! ire !!
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| 
|-
                                               ''finire''(to end/finish)

| io || -isco ||                               io finisco
|-
| tu || -isci ||                               tu finisci
|-
| lui/lei/Lei|| -isce ||                      lui/lei/Lei finisce
|-
| noi || -iamo ||                              noi finiamo
|-
| voi || -ite ||                               voi finite
|-
| loro || -iscono ||                           loro finiscono
|-
|}

Remember that, when followed by i or e, -sc- sounds like the English 'shake' (/ʃ/). If ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'' follow, -sc- will be read as in the English word 'sky' (/sk/).

==The Present Perfect (Passato Prossimo)==
The Passato Prossimo is one of the most commonly used past tenses in Italian. It is a compound tense, therefore the auxiliary verbs ''avere'' and ''essere'' are used in conjugation. Note that the following conjugations are both irregular.

{{col-begin|width=60%}}
{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

{{col-break|width=30%}}

|- 
| io || sono
|- 
| tu || sei 
|-
| lui/lei || è
|-
| noi || siamo 
|-
| voi || siete 
|-
| loro || sono
|-
|}

{{col-end}}

===The Past Participle===
The past participle is used with the verbs avere and essere to form the passato prossimo.  To form the past participle, the ending of the verb (-are, -ere, -ire) are changed as follows:
*verbs ending in -are take -ato for their past participle (e.g.: ''parlare'' → ''parlato'')
*verbs ending in -ere take -uto for their past participle (e.g.: ''cadere'' → ''caduto'')
*verbs ending in -ire take -ito for their past participle (e.g.: ''finire'' → ''finito'')

Note that the past participle of ''avere'' is ''avuto'' and the past participle of ''essere'' is ''stato''.

===Formation of the Passato Prossimo with ''Avere''===
To form the passato prossimo, you have to use avere or essere plus the past participle.  Most verbs take avere for the passato prossimo; all reflexive verbs take essere and a few select verbs of motion take essere.

For now, we deal with the verbs that take ''avere''. First, you conjugate ''avere'' for the appropriate subject, then place the past participle after it; an example follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Parlare (to speak)
|- 
| io || ho || parlato
|- 
| tu || hai || parlato 
|-
| lui/lei || ha || parlato
|-
| noi || abbiamo || parlato
|-
| voi || avete || parlato
|-
| loro || hanno || parlato
|-
|}

The literal translation of this is &quot;I have spoken&quot;, &quot;you have spoken&quot;, &quot;he/she has spoken&quot;, etc.  However, this tense is the main past tense used in Italian and can be loosely translated as &quot;I spoke&quot;, &quot;you spoke&quot;, &quot;he/she spoke&quot;, etc.
Note that almost all verbs are conjugated this way with the passato prossimo.

===Formation of the Passato Prossimo with ''Essere''===
The passato prossimo is generally conjugated with ''avere''; however there are some situations in which ''essere'' is used. Many verbs of motion as well as all the reflexive verbs, require ''essere''.

Some of the most common verbs that take ''essere'' are:
*arrivare (to arrive) 
*andare (to go)  
*uscire (to go out) 
*entrare (to enter) 
*venire as venuto (to come)
*essere as stato (to be) 
*partire (to leave) 
*stare as stato (to stay, to be) 
*sparire (to disappear) 
*tornare (to come back/return)
*nascere as nato (to be born)
*morire as morto (to die)
*rimanere as rimasto (to remain) 
Note that irregular past participles are in parentheses.

And before we get to an example, there is just one other difference between ''essere'' and ''avere'' for the passato prossimo.  While in conjugations with ''avere'', the past participle does not agree with the subject, it must in ''essere''.

E.g., when a feminine subject wants to say 'I spoke', she would say 'io ho parlat'''o''''. But if she wants to say 'I was', she would use ''essere'' and the respective form of the participle: 'io sono stat'''a''''. Similar changes occur for plural subjects, such as ''noi'', which can have a past participle ending in -i or -e. An example of a passato prossimo with ''essere'' follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Nascere (to be born)
|- 
| io || sono || nato/a
|- 
| tu || sei || nato/a 
|-
| lui/lei || è || nato/a
|-
| noi || siamo || nati/e
|-
| voi || siete || nati/e
|-
| loro || sono || nati/e
|-
|}

==The Future Indicative (Il futuro indicativo)==
The future indicative is the equivalent of 'will + a verb' or 'be going to + a verb' in English.  It is not a compound tense in Italian (it is not formed with ''avere''/''essere'' like the passato prossimo).

The verbs ''avere'' and ''essere'' are irregular in the future indicative.  Their conjugations are:

{{col-begin|width=60%}}
{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Essere (to be)
|- 
| io || sarò
|- 
| tu || sarai
|-
| lui/lei || sarà
|-
| noi || saremo
|-
| voi || sarete
|-
| loro || saranno
|-
|}

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Avere (to have)
|- 
| io || avrò
|- 
| tu || avrai
|-
| lui/lei || avrà
|-
| noi || avremo
|-
| voi || avrete
|-
| loro || avranno
|-
|}

{{col-end}}

===Regular Verbs in the Future Tense / Verbi regolari al futuro ===
The verbs ending by -are and -ere are conjugated by adding the same set of endings for the future indicative. These endings are ''-erò'', ''-erai'', ''-erà'', ''-eremo'', ''-erete'', and ''-eranno''.

The endings for -ire verbs are similar but exactly the same; the difference is that the first ''e'' of the ending is replaced by ''i''. Therefore the endings are: ''-irò'',''-irai'', ''-irà'', ''-iremo'', ''-irete'', ''-iranno''.

{{col-begin|width=90%}}
{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Parlare (to speak)
|- 
| io || parlerò
|- 
| tu || parlerai
|-
| lui/lei || parlerà
|-
| noi || parleremo
|-
| voi || parlerete
|-
| loro || parleranno
|-
|}

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Vendere (to sell)
|- 
| io || venderò
|- 
| tu || venderai
|-
| lui/lei || venderà
|-
| noi || venderemo
|-
| voi || venderete
|-
| loro || venderanno
|-
|}

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Finire (to finish)
|- 
| io || finirò
|- 
| tu || finirai
|-
| lui/lei || finirà
|-
| noi || finiremo
|-
| voi || finirete
|-
| loro || finiranno
|-
|}

{{col-end}}

There is a small group of verbs whose infinitive ends with ''-gare'' or ''-care''. In the formation of the future indicative, these verbs require an ''h'' to keep the consistency with the rules of pronunciation. An example of such case follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Dimenticare (to forget)
|- 
| io || dimentic'''h'''erò
|- 
| tu || dimentic'''h'''erai
|-
| lui/lei || dimentic'''h'''erà
|-
| noi || dimentic'''h'''eremo
|-
| voi || dimentic'''h'''erete
|-
| loro || dimentic'''h'''eranno
|-
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==
'''Role Theory''' proposed that human behavior is guided by expectations held both by the individual and by other people.  The expectations correspond to different roles individuals ''perform'' or ''enact'' in their daily lives, such as secretary, father, or friend. For instance, most people hold pre-conceived notions of the role expectations of a secretary, which might include: answering phones, making and managing appointments, filing paperwork, and typing memos.  These role expectations would not be expected of a professional soccer player.

Individuals generally have and manage many roles. Roles consist of a set of rules or norms that function as plans or blueprints to guide behavior. Roles specify what goals should be pursued, what tasks must be accomplished, and what performances are required in a given scenario or situation. Role theory holds that a substantial proportion of observable, day-to-day social behavior is simply persons carrying out their roles, much as actors carry out their roles on the stage or ballplayers theirs on the field.  Role theory is, in fact, predictive.  It implies that if we have information about the role expectations for a specified position (e.g., sister, fireman, prostitute), a significant portion of the behavior of the persons occupying that position can be predicted.

What's more, role theory also argues that in order to change behavior it is necessary to change roles; roles correspond to behaviors and vice versa.  In addition to heavily influencing behavior, roles influence beliefs and attitudes; individuals will change their beliefs and attitudes to correspond with their roles.  For instance, someone over-looked for a promotion to a managerial position in a company may change their beliefs about the benefits of management by convincing him/herself that they didn't want the additional responsibility that would have accompanied the position.

Many role theorists see ''Role Theory'' as one of the most compelling theories bridging individual behavior and social structure.  Roles, which are in part dictated by social structure and in part by social interactions (see the two approaches outlined below), guide the behavior of the individual.  The individual, in turn, influences the norms, expectations, and behaviors associated with roles.  The understanding is reciprocal and didactic.

===Structural-Functional Perspective===
The functionalist approach sees a ''role'' as the set of expectations that society places on an individual. By unspoken consensus, certain behaviours are deemed ''appropriate'' and others ''inappropriate''. For example, it is appropriate for a doctor to dress fairly conservatively, ask a series of personal questions about one's health, touch one in ways that would normally be forbidden, write prescriptions, and show more concern for the personal well-being of his clients.  Electricians or shopkeepers may also show concern for the well-being of their clients, but if they start touching their clients, especially where doctors are allowed to touch, they'll get in trouble; they will have stepped outside of the norms associated with their roles.

In the functionalist conception, role is one of the important ways in which individual activity is socially regulated: roles create regular patterns of behaviour and thus a measure of predictability, which not only allows individuals to function effectively because they know what to expect of others, but also makes it possible for the sociologist to make generalisations about society. Collectively, a group of interlocking roles creates a social institution: the institution of law, for example, can be seen as the combination of many roles, including: ''police officer'', ''judge'', ''criminal'', and ''victim''.

Roles, in the functionalist perspective, are relatively inflexible and are more-or-less universally agreed upon. Although it is recognised that different roles interact (''teacher'' and ''student''), and that roles are usually defined in relation to other roles (''doctor'' and ''patient'' or ''mother'' and ''child''), the functionalist approach has great difficulty in accounting for variability and flexibility of roles and finds it difficult to account for the vast differences in the way that individuals conceive different roles. Taken to extremes, the functionalist approach results in ''role'' becoming a set of static, semi-global expectations laid down by a unified, amorphous society. The distinction between ''role'' and ''norm'' (or ''culture'') thus becomes sterile.

The functionalist approach has been criticized for its static understanding of roles. Even so, it remains a fundamental concept which is still taught in most introductory courses and is still regarded as important.

Interestingly, this conception has crossed over from academic discourse into popular use. It has become commonplace to speak of particular ''roles'' as if they were indeed fixed, agreed upon by all, and uncontroversial (e.g., ''the role of the teacher'' or ''a parent's role''). This everyday usage nearly always employs ''role'' in a normative way, to imply that ''this is the proper behaviour'' for a teacher or a parent, or even for an entire institution.

===Interactionist Perspective===
The interactionist definition of ''role'' is more fluid and subtle than the functionalist perspective. A ''role'', in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals. 

One of the ways Mead explained the idea of roles was by using a development model for children.  According to Mead, children adopt roles in the development of a self. In so doing, they pass through three stages:

#preparatory stage - meaningless imitation by the infant; assumes roles but doesn't understand what they are
#play stage - actual playing of roles occurs; but no unified conception of self
#game stage - completion stage of self; child finds himself; must respond to simultaneous roles; the individual can act with a certain amount of consistency in a variety of situations because he/she acts in accordance with a generalized set of expectations and definitions he/she has internalized

Adults, of course, are beyond the game stage, but continue to adopt roles and adapt them through interpersonal interactions.  This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable ambiguity. For instance, let's assume person X has a friend who is also a lawyer; we'll call him Y. If X approaches Y as a friend but then asks for legal advice, this forces Y to either switch roles completely or merge the roles temporarily.  Until Y decides on his course of action, role ambiguity will exist.

&quot; A person should be physically, socially and spiritually strong&quot;.

===Additional Approaches===
*structural - little attention given to norms; attention is focused on social structures conceived as stable organizations of sets of persons (called social positions or statuses) who share the same, patterned behaviors (roles)
*organization - focuses on social systems that are preplanned, task-oriented, and hierarchical; roles in such organizations are assumed to be associated with identified social positions and to be generated by normative expectations
*cognitive role theory - focuses on relationships between role expectations and behavior
&lt;u&gt;(from Biddle 1986)&lt;/u&gt;

==Propositions==
Role Theory includes the following propositions:
# people spend much of their lives participating as members of groups and organizations
# within these groups, people occupy distinct positions
# each of these positions entails a role, which is a set of functions performed by the person for the group
# groups often formalize role expectations as norms or even codified rules, which include what rewards will result when roles are successfully performed and what punishments will result when roles are not successfully performed
# individuals usually carry out their roles and perform in accordance with prevailing norms; in other words, role theory assumes that people are primarily conformists who try to live up to the norms that accompany their roles
# group members check each individual's performance to determine whether it conforms with the norms; the anticipation that others will apply sanctions ensures role performance

==Extensions of the Theory==
Role Theory has been a fruitful approach to understanding humans and society.  As a result, various derivatives and additional concepts have developed.

===Role Confusion===
''Role confusion'' is a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he/she should assume. For example, if a graduate student were to attend a department party at a professor's home, the student may find it difficult to determine if he/she should act as a student toward the professor, exhibiting deference or respect, or as a friend or associate, showing collegiality and familiarity.

===Role Conflict===
''Role Conflict'' results when an individual encounters tensions as the result of incompatible roles.  For instance, a mother who is employed full-time may experience role conflict because of the norms that are associated with the two roles she has.  She may be expected to spend a great deal of time taking care of her children while simultaneously trying to advance her career.

===Role Strain===
''Role Strain'' refers to the felt difficulty in fulfilling role obligations.  In contrast to ''role conflict'', where tension is felt between two competing roles, the tension in role strain comes from just one role.  Returning to the example of a mother, if she were to find that she is unable to fulfill her obligations as defined by, say, an overly demanding spouse (or religion, or child), she would experience role strain.  The ''role expectations'' may be beyond what she is able to achieve or may push her to the limits of her abilities.

===Role Distance===
''Role Distance'' is the effectively expressed pointed separateness between the individual and his putative role. The individual is not denying the role but the virtual self that is implied in the role for all accepting performers. The concept of ''role distance'' provides a sociological means of dealing with one type of divergence between obligation and actual performance. For example, the ''maturing'' adolescent who is forced to ride a merry-go-round may display role distance by acting as though the ride does not challenge her physical abilities or frighten her.  This may be displayed by riding backwards or leaning dangerously from her horse.

Immediate audiences figure very directly in the display of role distance; actors need an audience or a co-conspirator for role distancing to work. There are two ways of establishing role distance:
#isolating one's self from the contamination of the situation, which can be displayed through indifference (e.g., a waiter saying, &quot;I'm just doing this to put myself through college.&quot;)
#joking about the situation (e.g., the young merry-go-round rider saying, &quot;I can do this with my eyes closed.&quot;)

It is often possible to determine incidents in which ''role distance'' might be displayed solely on the grounds of the performers' gross age-sex characteristics. A seventeen year-old boy riding a merry-go-round (especially with peers) will likely  display significant role distance.  

===Role Embracement===
''Role Embracement'' refers to the complete adoption of a role.  When a role is truly embraced, the self disappears completely into the role.  Three things seem to be involved in the earnestness with which people assume roles or the degree to which they embrace a role:
#an admitted or expressed attachment to the role
#a demonstration of qualifications and capacities for performing it
#an active engagement or spontaneous involvement in the role activity at hand, that is, a visible investment of attention and muscular effort

==Limitations==
Role theory has a hard time explaining social deviance when it does not correspond to a pre-specified role.  For instance, the behavior of someone who adopts the role of bank robber can be predicted - she will rob banks.  But if a bank teller simply begins handing out cash to random people, role theory would be unable to explain why (though ''role conflict'' could be one possible answer; the teller might have taken the job wanting to be a modern day Robin Hood).

Another limitation of role theory is that it does not and cannot explain how role expectations came to be what they are. Role theory has no explanation for why it is expected of male soldiers to cut their hair short, but it could predict with a high degree of accuracy that if someone is a male soldier they will have short hair.  Additionally, role theory does not explain when and how role expectations change.

==Notes==
from Batson, Schoenrade, and Ventis
p. 28 &quot;Shakespeare put it clearly in As You Like It (Act II, Scene vii):

All the world's a stage.
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts....

&quot;Many social psychologists and sociologists, most notably Erving Goffman (1959), have used this dramaturgical analogy between social life and a stage play to talk about subtle, indirect forms of social influence. In doing so, these psychologists and sociologists typically emphasize three concepts: social roles, social norms, and reference groups. Within the dramaturgical analogy, social roles are the parts to be played, social norms the script of the play, and reference groups the audience.
&quot;Social roles may be formally defined as behavior patterns that are characteristic, and expected, of a person or persons who occupy some position in a social structure. Less formally, they are the parts to be played in the social drama. Of course, playing roles in society is considerably more complex than playing a part in a play. Each of us is called on to play a number of different social roles at once. Some are very specific and well defined; others are general and ambiguous. For example, as a young man, Tony Bassillio might be called on to play simultaneously the roles of premedical student, son, brother, apartment-mate, Catholic, Democrat, part-time mechanic, fiancé, aware 20-year-old, and man. Each of these roles has its own more or less explicit script.&quot;
There's the reference I was looking for my role-theory write up.

'''Thyme''' is a herb, the leaf (fresh or dried) of a number of related plants. It is often used to flavour meats, soups and stews. It is used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]], where it is an important element in a [[Cookbook:Bouquet Garni|bouquet garni]]. It is also widely used in West Indian cuisine. In Jordan the condiment [[Cookbook:Za'atar|za'atar]] contains thyme as a vital ingredient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==
'''Reinforcement Theory''' proposes that social behavior is governed by external events (events outside the human psyche). The basic premise is that people will more likely perform a specific behavior if it is followed directly by the occurrence of something pleasurable or by the removal of something aversive.  Additionally, the opposite premise is also included in the theory, but tends not to have as strong of an impact on behavior: people will less likely perform a specific behavior if it is followed by something aversive or the removal of something pleasurable. One of the benefits of this approach to understanding human (and animal) behavior is that the events are observable, as compared with cognitive theories of human behavior.

The external events that play a role in reinforcement theory are referred to as stimuli.  They include any event that leads to an alteration or change in behavior.  The change in behavior induced by a stimulus is a response.

Reinforcement theory has been operationalized in a process called operant conditioning. Positive reinforcement is the contingent presentation of a stimulus following a response, resulting in an increased likelihood of the response occurring in the future. Negative reinforcement is the contingent withdrawal of a stimulus following a response, resulting in an increased likelihood of the response occurring in the future. Unconditioned reinforcement, also called primary reinforcement, is the presentation of stimuli that are inherently reinforcing, such as affection, food, sex, or sleep. Conditioned reinforcement, also called secondary reinforcement, is the presentation of a stimulus which has acquired reinforcing power through association with primary reinforcers. Social reinforcement is a form of conditioned reinforcement in which the reinforcer involves some sort of interaction with others. Positive punishment is the contingent presentation of a stimulus following a response, resulting in a decreased likelihood of the response occurring in the future, whereas negative punishment is the contingent withdrawal of a stimulus following a response, resulting in a decreased likelihood of the response occurring in the future.

Successive approximation is the presentation of reinforcers after increasingly accurate productions of the desired response. For example, in training rats or pigeons to depress a lever or peck a key, reinforcement will initially be contingent on simply turning toward the lever or key. As training progresses, the response reinforced becomes progressively more like the response desired by the trainer (i.e., actually pecking the key). Behaviours developed through the reinforcement of successive approximations to the eventual desired behaviour are called shaped behaviours and the process is called shaping.

The study of reinforcement has produced strong, replicable results. The effects of different schedules of reinforcement (i.e., variations in the rate or ratio of reinforcement) have been extensively studied. Some of these schedules include:

* Continuous reinforcement, in which a reinforcer is presented after every desired response,
* Fixed ratio, in which a reinforcer is presented after every nth response,
* Fixed interval, in which a reinforcer is presented after the passage of a specified length of time from the beginning of training or from the presentation of the last reinforcer, provided a response has been made during the period,
* Variable ratio, in which the number of responses between reinforcers varies, but on the average equals a predetermined number
* Variable interval, in which the time between reinforcers varies, but on the average equals a predetermined time.

Ratio schedules produce higher rates of responding than interval schedules, with variable ratio scales producing the highest rates of response. Variable ratio schedules produce the greatest resistance to extinction, which is the decline in response strength following the cessation of reinforcement.

==Propositions==
==Limitations==
This theoretical approach to understanding human behavior has been criticized on a number of levels.  First, it has been criticized as employing circular reasoning, since it appears to argue that response strength is increased by reinforcement while defining reinforcement as something which increases response strength. However, non-circular definitions have been proposed. For example, reinforcement can be defined as consummatory behaviour contingent on a response. 

Another limitation of this theoretical approach is that it portrays individuals as primarily reacting to environmental stimuli rather than as initiating behavior based on imaginative or creative thought.  In short, it downplays the role of cognition in human behavior.  As a result, this theoretical approach downplays the influence of other motivations in explaining human behavior.  Additionally, reinforcement theory cannot explain  selfless behavior and altruism, instances where the individual acts to their own detriment in order to help another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gujarati}}

Though Gujarati has its own set of numeric signs (placed alongside their Hindu-Arabic [or Indo-Arabic] counterparts in the tables below), they are employed in much the same way as English employs its own; that is to say, they are put together in the same manner in order to express larger numbers. It is quite possible to simply substitute the Gujarati numerals for the Hindu-Arabic ones.

The Gujarati words for 1-10 are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

Sadly, the words for eleven through nineteen are completely irregular in Gujarati. Though they do bear some resemblance to their 1-10 counterparts, they must simply be individually memorized:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Real water waves are exceedingly complex, however it is fortunate that a great number of observations can be explained on the basis of the small amplitude wave theory which makes many assumptions, but simplifies the mathematics involved considerably. The problem that is to be solved is essentially a boundary value problem. In order to solve this problem, we need to find the differential equation, and the conditions at the boundaries. We first begin by formulating the problem as a boundary value problem.

==Problem Formulation==
===Differential equation===
We are given that water waves form in some water body. What we need to find out are the essential properties of these waves and what parameters govern them. In short we need to develop a theory of water waves. The first step towards this end will be to find out what properties hold good in the water body while there are waves on its free surface.

Let us assume that the fluid is incompressible and only irrotational motion takes place. Basic hydrodynamics tells us that a velocity potential will exist which will satisfy the continuity equation. Therefore, the following equation will hold.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;
In three dimensions, this is the Laplace equation and is written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The Laplace equation is linear and therefore any solutions can be combined linearly to yield more solutions. Furthermore, there are many solutions to the equation and not all are valid for our problem. We will pick our solution depending on the boundary conditions.

===Bottom Boundary Conditions===
At the bottom, we basically see that the kinematic conditions must be satisfied. What this means is that at any interface, there must be no flow across the interface. The fluid cannot flow across the bottom. It is this limitation that we need to express in the form of an equation to form the bottom boundary condition.
If we imagine that we are fixed with respect to the surface, the total derivative of the water surface will be zero, since we move with the surface. Thus on any surface, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{DF(x,y,z,t)}{Dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying this equation leads us to the result that 

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{u}\cdot\vec{n}=\frac{\partial F/ \partial t}{|\nabla F|}&lt;/math&gt; on the bottom surface.

Let us now imagine that we have a bottom described by &lt;math&gt;z = h(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. The above formulation if the condition leads us to the simple result that 

:&lt;math&gt;u\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial h}{\partial y} + w = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Free Surface Boundary Conditions===
As far as the free surface conditions are concerned, there are two basic conditions that must be met. First, the kinematic condition must be taken up as described in the case of the development of the bottom boundary condition and then we also need to take up the dynamic free surface condition.

====Kinematic Free Surface Condition====
As described above, the kinematic condition is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{DF(x,y,z,t)}{Dt}=w&lt;/math&gt;

If the surface is defined by &lt;math&gt;z = \eta(x,y,t)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;w = \left. \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}  \right\|_{z=\eta(x,y,t)}&lt;/math&gt;

====Dynamic Free Surface Condition====
The water surface is not a fixed surface, nor is it a surface that can resist pressure variations. Thus the pressure on the surface is taken constant and the following equation holds on the surface.

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} (u^2 + v^2 + w^2) +gz = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===Lateral Conditions===
These conditions depend on the specifics of the problem. It may require modeling of a beach or a wave maker. We will ignore this part of the problem for now and do an analysis having no lateral limits. We will study some lateral conditions later.
===Other Conditions===
Apart from the aforementioned boundary conditions, from the physical nature of the problem we see that the solution must be periodic in both space and time.
==Solution==
If we are looking for solutions that are waves, assume that the surface is &lt;math&gt; \eta(x,y,t) = a \cos(kx + ly - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;.  Given this choice of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary conditions suggest that the potential should be in the form

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x,y,z,t) = f(z) \sin(kx+ly-\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

After applying the dynamic free surface boundary condition, we arrive at the dispersion relation

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^2 = gk \tanh(kH) &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt{g/k \tanh(kH)} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Calculators are a very controversial issue in the classroom. Some people feel that it is effective in changing students' attitudes toward math and that it gives them the opportunity to experience realistic applications. On the other hand, there are teachers and parents who expect students to be able to do basic mathematical operations mentally or at least with paper and pencil.  However, some students truly struggle with basic mathematic calculations (ex: memorizing multiplication facts, long division and operations with fractions).


'''Website on the Benefits of Calculator Use in Mathematics Classrooms ''' http://education.ti.com/us/resources/research/therole.html

This links to a site that outlines the benefits of calculator use in mathematics classrooms from Kindergarten through the University level. Calculators are tools for doing mathematical computations. This site describes how calculators, when used appropriately, can also be a tool for learning mathematics. Appropriate use of calculators is a way of increasing the amount and the quality of learning afforded students during the course of their mathematics education.  Be careful however, the site is sponsored by Texas Instruments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Individualized Education Program ==
[[http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html IEP]] stands for Individualized Education Program and is the plan agreed upon by the parents/guardians and educators for every child that is designated as needing special education. They are reviewed yearly and altered if needed.

=== Examples of IEP goals and objectives: ===
The student will develop/increase their math application skills by identifying/using graphs and tables to obtain information 80% of the time on an informal test.

The student will develop/increase vocabulary and word recognition skills by recognizing/recalling common sight words, critical sight words: colors, numbers, months, days of the week, Dolch list, survival words 8 out of 10 tries.

=== Customizing for the IEP Using Reusable Learning Objects ===
In a nutshell, special education is customizing lessons to meet each students’ needs. Reusable learning objects will allow teachers to do just that. Students in special education need to be exposed to the same information as their regular education peers, but not necessarily in the same format. Since students with the same disability can function at different levels, it is very difficult to find a textbook to accommodate a given group of students. Another problem with textbooks is that they are usually written at grade level. Students with disabilities often do not read at grade level. They need other ways to access the information.

A well constructed learning object deals with a single idea or chunk of content. A teacher can string these objects together to create or support a lesson. Searching through learning object depositories, teachers would be able to review objects and find ones that met the needs of their students. Because RLO's are digital, they are limited only by the creativity of the author. The issue of reading level could perhaps be avoided by finding an object that taught through animation. Sound can also be incorporated into learning objects to assist with the reading level issue. as well, or for those student whose learning modality is more aural than visual. They may also need to have the content presented differently, or in a number of ways before they get the meaning. This can be easily accomplished with this digital medium.

In some cases, templates are available. Using a template for a learning object, even teachers with minimal experience can provide numerous opportunities for learning. Once a student is familiar with the interactivity of the particular learning object, the no longer have to worry about what to do and can focus on learning the content. For many students in special education, reading and following directions can be a problem. If a student is familiar with a particular format they can work on their own without having to wait for instructions.

Memory is also an issue for many students in special education. Some need a great deal more exposure to the content than their peers. If the teacher is also the author of the learning object he/she would be able to easily personalize these objects to make them more meaningful to the student. More importantly, they could be tailored to address the specific objectives from that student's IEP. Building quizzes and tests into the objects would also allow the student and the teacher to monitor the student's progress.

More and more, teachers are expected to individualize instruction. Reusable learning objects can make this much easier. Textbooks are expensive and districts aren't likely to purchase individual ones for students as teachers might like. Specialized packets aren't any more practical in the long run. The costs of paper and the purchasing and maintaining of copiers is a constant packets is extrememly time-consuming for teachers. Storing all these accumulated materials also gets to be a problem over time. Eventually, closets and storerooms become filled with leftover materials that either did not work out as expected or were extra because many materials have to be ordered in specified quantities.

Initially, creating and/or retrieving learing objects may be time-consuming, but, once assembled, the teacher need just review and edit them for use with another student and/or class. No more flipping through workbooks and hours in front of a copier or rummaging through dusty closets. With a well-organized favorites folder and a few clicks of a mouse, teachers will be able to construct customized lessons and for students that genuinely reflect the goals and objectives on their IEP's.

A quine is also a kind of self-replicating automaton, except for the fact that rather than reproducing itself in the executable format, it produces as output the source code for the program.

There has long been speculation about a self-replicating machine.

The [[w:RepRap Project|RepRap Project]] is currently attempting to build the first generation of just such a device.

In 1986, Drexler suggested the possibility of [[w:grey goo|grey goo]].

'''Brining''' is the process of soaking food in a solution of salt and water. Although a brine only requires salt and water, it is common to add flavouring agents to the brine as osmotic pressure will circulate any solutes in the brine throughout much of the food.

Brining is typically used for various types of [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], as well as [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]. It can also be used to process [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]], with [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]] being a common example.

{{see also|Cookbook:Marinating}}

== Modern Uses in Home Recipes ==
Brining is a technique used by modern cooks to improve the juiciness and tenderness of meat, such as [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|lean pork]], that may dry out due to modern breeding practices.

Commonly, meat is soaked in a brine solution overnight, then taken out of the brine and [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] or [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]].  The result is juicier than without brining.  Brining can affect the texture of the meat a little, but the flavor can be much improved.

==Introduction==
A self-replicating automaton is a mechanism which construct copies of itself; generally, it is assumed that building materials come from the environment hosting the automaton.  Abstract models were first developed by John von Neumann in the late 1940s, termed kinematic and tessellation models.  The kinematic model is based on now modern notions of robotics.  The tessellation model is now know as cellular automata.

The origins of self-replicating code could be traced back to simple pranks and geek humour. The reluctance of society to accept inevitable changes and its inherent suspicion - both gifts of its adaptive response for survival - as well as the social animals' craving for individuality has resulted in these interesting forms being looked upon as a contagion rather than primary stages of artificial life.

This view of being a contagion has in turn influenced the whole linguistics of the community which itself is composed of “virus writers” and “anti virus writers”. Continuing the tradition it  is sincerely hoped that every time the term &quot;virus&quot; is used it is in good humor.

Few highlights in the evolution of the present automaton are now discussed. Detailed analysis will follow in the [[SRA:Evolution|Evolution]] section.

== The 80s ==
By 1990 at least 50 viruses affecting IBM PCs and around 15 viruses affecting the Apple Mac machines were well known (analysed and studied by the antiviral community).

It is generally accepted that the first virus to spread in the wild was [[SRA:Elk Cloner|Elk Cloner]] which spread on Apple II floppy disks.It appeared around 1981-82. This period was followed by the legendary paper by Fred Cohen. By 1986 there were many strains of [[SRA:Brain|Brain]] virus prevalent. It was a boot sector infector. The common story is that it originated in Pakistan, its authors being two brothers. Virdem, the first file infector also emerged in the same year.

In 1984, A. K. Dewdney introduced the game &quot;[[w:Core War|Core War]]&quot; to the public, in an article in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewdney |first=A.&amp;nbsp;K. |authorlink=Alexander Dewdney |year=1984 |month=May |title=In the game called Core War hostile programs engage in a battle of bits. |journal=Scientific American |url=http://corewar.co.uk/vogtmann/first.htm |accessdate=2008-11-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, many file infectors started appearing, especially infecting COMMAND.COM The first one of these is considered to be [[SRA:Lehigh|Lehigh]] virus. The file infectors mainly concentrated on the simple binary format or COM files. But research  on how to develop EXE infectors was also going on. This culminated in the production of the [[SRA:Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] virus family. The Concept of Worms, code which is able to self replicate without infection, was also well developed by this time. Christmas Worm, with a high replication rate infected the IBM Mainframes during this period.

Robert Morris released an internet worm in 1988, resulting in the first internet crisis. Early 90s saw the emergence of Virus Exchange (VX)BBS allowing programmers to share ideas and code.

== The 90s ==

Till this point the antivirus softwares mainly searched for the viral presence by using certain signatures or code traces which would be present in any infected file. 
But with the appearance of Polymorphic viruses this philosophy had to change. 
In 1991, the first polymorphic virus Tequila was released.

In 1992 Michaelangelo gained a lot of publicity from the Media. Then came the MtE from Dark Avenger. This year also saw the appearance of Construction Kits for Viruses with pulldown menus and easy interface requiring very little programming experience to create a virus.

1995 brought with it a new concept in viral technology – Macro Viruses. Concept was the first macro virus and it infected Word Documents. This marks one of the earliest deviations from simple infection of the executables to infection of data files.

After the launch of Windows 95, the first true Win95 virus Boza appeared in 1996. 
This year also saw the Laroux, or a Excel Spreadsheet infector, and Staog, a Linux virus. 
A java virus, Strange Brew was observed in 1998, further extending the possibilities of victim files.

In 1999 Melissa was released causing worldwide chaos. Corner appeared, which infected Powerpoint presentations. Tristate also emerged which infected Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations.

== 2000 onwards ==

A major shift from viruses to worms could be seen in the latter years of the 90s. More and more worms started appearing. In 2000 Love Letter worm became the fastest spreading worm till date. It was also an interesting example of social engineering used for maximisation of spread. Streams, the proof of concept virus was the first to utilise the Alternate Data Stream of NTFS file system.

With the appearance of more and more languages and platforms, new ways of coding viruses evolved. Pirus for example was coded in PHP Scripting Language. It tries to infect HTML and php pages.Another example is Gnuman specifically attacking the gnutella p2p system. Winux, a proof of concept virus which could operate under both windows and Linux was released in 2001. Another example is the PeachyPDF-A, the first worm to utilise pdf files for its propagation.

Continuing with the trend as discussed above LFM-926, the first virus to shockwave Flash files(.swf) was released in 2002. In March 2002, Sharp-A the first .NET worm written in C# (apparently by a female hacker known as Gigabyte) was released. In late May, came Benjamin which attacked kazaa p2p system. Another interesting specimen was the Perrun virus which attached a portion of itself to JPEG image files.

2003 was another year of the worms. Some examples of worms which started spreading in this year were sobig (which had its own smtp engine), Slammer, Lovgate, Blaster etc. Social engineering techniques also developed quite a bit.

In February 2004 it was seen that virus writers were starting to use their craft for money. A German magazine managed to buy a list of infected IP addresses from a distributor of the virus Randex. These IP addresses were for sale to spammers who could use the infected machines as mail zombies. The end of April saw the Sasser worm which is the first to effectively use the LSASS Windows vulnerability; a vulnerability that allowed the worm to spread via an open FTP port instead of through E-mail.

The proof-of-concept Worm W64.Rugrat.3344 showed up the end of May. This is claimed to be the first malware that specifically attacks 64-bit Windows files only (it ignores 32-bit and 16-bit files). It was created using IA64 (Intel Architecture) assembly code.

In June Symb/Cabir-A which infects Nokia Series 60 mobile phones. It uses the bluetooth technology to spread to all bluetooth enabled devices in the vicinity. Early September saw W32/Amus-A show up. The only thing that qualified this beast to even be mentioned here was that it uses the Microsoft Speech engine in Windows to read out loud: &quot;hamsi. I am seeing you. Haaaaaaaa. You must come to turkiye. I am cleaning your computer. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. 0. Gule. Gule.&quot; 

On 14 September that paragon of virus-free file type, the JPEG image, came under attack. To be accurate, the image file itself is not so much to blame as a Microsoft common .DLL file that processes the image file type and has a buffer overrun error that could allow someone to add malicious code to a JPEG image which can then open holes in an attacked system. Shortly after, some Trojan exploits started to appear.

Santy worm appeared towards the end of 2004. It was written in Perl and used google to search for victims, which were phpBB forums and used certain vulnerabilities in phpBB code for spreading.

In 2005, at the end of January Bropia worm appeared which targets MSN Messenger for spreading. This is a sophisticated worm that spreads via E-mail and the MSN Messaging client. Its messages are very close to what a real user would send and, for the first time, attempts to spoof the return address as being from an anti-virus company (Trend or Symantec, and Microsoft, although coming from Microsoft has been a social engineering ploy for some time now).

Around 2006,
some mathematicians explore the possibility of a computer program that generates, not merely another copy of the same program, but a better program.

      <comment>/* Disadvantages of Rapid Prototyping */ changed results to result to fix grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructional Design is the systematic approach to the development of instruction through Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. This ISD model is known as the [[Instructional Technology]]/[[Instructional Design]]/[[ADDIE]] model. Each phase in this model is done in a linear method. Rapid Prototyping is an alternate approach to the traditional instructional design. A prototype is an early phase of a system that has the same key feature components of the &quot;real&quot; thing.  In ID technology,allows greater flexibility in defining the goals and form of instruction at early stages.(Wilson &amp; Cole, 1993) Designers may opt to use Rapid Instructional Design (or Rapid Prototyping) when the following are factors: 
&lt;p&gt;• Time&lt;br&gt;
• Budget&lt;br&gt;
• Environmental restraints&lt;/p&gt;
When instructional designers are confronted with these demands, the use of rapid prototyping methodologies &quot;should reduce production time because: (a)using working models of the final product early in a project tends to eliminate time-consuming revisions later on, and (b)design tasks are completed concurrently, rather than sequentially throughout the project.&quot; (Jones and Richey, 2000)
With RP, the steps are crunched together to reduce the amount of time needed to develop training or a product. The design and development phases are done simultaneously and the formative evaluation is done throughout the process. &lt;br&gt;

----
Rapid prototyping can be used in situations to: test out a user interface, test the database structure and flow of information in a training system, test the effectiveness and appeal of a particular instructional strategy, develop a model case or practice exercise that can serve as a template, give clients and sponsors a more concrete model of the intended instructional product, and to get user feedback and reactons to two competing approaches. (Wilson, Jonassen, &amp; Cole, 1993)&lt;br&gt;

== Techniques for Rapid [[Instructional Technology/Instructional Design|Instructional Design]] ==

George M. Piskurich(2000) lists the following rapid design techniques for instructional development in each phase of the ADDIE model:&lt;br&gt;
'''A-ANALYZE'''&lt;br&gt;

1. Use retro assessment-ask the &quot;right questions&quot; to fill in the background on the program you are creating &lt;br&gt;
2. Interview the top 10 people most and first for an organizational assessment&lt;br&gt;
3. Perform a quick approach to a performance gap by&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the problem&lt;br&gt;
*Analyze the tasks and conditions of the job&lt;br&gt;
*Analyze the current performance level&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the causes of the problem&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the desired performance outcome&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the expectations of your training related to the outcome&lt;br&gt;
4.Forego time-intensive interviews and focus groups of a training needs assessment&lt;br&gt;
5.Use electronic bulletins instead of live meetings to collect data&lt;br&gt;
6.Interview two at a time or use net-based surveys to gather information&lt;br&gt;
7.Choose individuals who are not over-experienced to do a job analysis so that the information is not too complicated or use job descriptors that are well-detailed for job analysis&lt;br&gt;
8. Spend a day observing a Subject Matter Expert (SME) at work and ask questions for task analysis&lt;br&gt;
9. Videotape experts doing their jobs and analyze it for the component points&lt;br&gt;

'''D-DESIGN'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Use job analysis and distribute completed objectives and distribute&lt;br&gt;
2. Keep formal reporting to a minimum-jot down what you need to know&lt;br&gt;
3. Create a series of tests at various levels and distribute them to the trainees along with the objectives they are based on&lt;br&gt;
4. Use logical sequencing of steps&lt;br&gt;

'''D-Development'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Use existing polices, procedures, annual reports, magazine articles, pamphlets, etc. for training material&lt;br&gt;
2. Use games that let you alternate the content for instructional use or use templates&lt;br&gt;
3. Strip training of &quot;nice to know&quot; to &quot;must know&quot;&lt;br&gt;
4. Short cut video production by taping short video clips of SMEs doing their work and describing the process&lt;br&gt; or tape a SME as he/she does the training process&lt;br&gt;

'''I-Implementation'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Have reviewers or validators of the design meet as a group&lt;br&gt;
2. Allow the trainers train the trainers&lt;br&gt;

'''E-Evaluation'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Evaluate only what you need to evaluate&lt;br&gt;
2. Use performance checklists as a transfer evaluation to re-check performance&lt;br&gt;

With Rapid Prototyping the ADDIE model is not used as designed. It typically has several steps merged together to streamline the process. Rapid Prototyping should not be used by a novice, because even though it cuts out steps of ADDIE, the designer still must have knowledge of the whole process.

== Advantages of Rapid Prototyping ==
There are many advantages to using RP in instructional design. It allows for better communication between the designer and users because the needs are clearly expressed from the beginning. The user is able to offer immediate feedback which results in a better product. Its non-linear approach allows for more flexibility in the instruction and can catch problems early in the development stages. 
Moreover, RP reduces development time and costs.&lt;br&gt;

== Disadvantages of Rapid Prototyping ==

Some people believe that rapid prototyping is not an effective model of instructional design because it does not replicate the real thing. They believe that many important steps of instructional design are forfeited for a faster, cheaper model. Many problems may be overlooked and result in endless revision.

{{Wikipedia|Varroa destructor}}
Also known as the Vampire Mite, Varroa Mite, Varroa Destructor and often mislabeled as Varroa Jacobsoni.

The Varroa Mite is a parasitic mite that can cause serious trouble to beekeepers and their bees alike. This tick-like mite, around the sized of a pinhead, does its damage by feeding on the bee’s hemolymph fluid (akin to bee blood). Mites attach themselves to foraging workers in order to spread themselves from one hive to another. This mite can severally weaken a hive through vampire-like action and through the spread of disease and bacteria. An unchecked mite population will almost certainly lead to the premature death of a honeybee colony. 

Within the United States, Varroa Mites have the largest impact when compared to other pests within the beekeeping industry. The Varroa Mite is also nearly completely responsible for the decimation and loss of feral honeybee colonies. Some beekeepers have resorted to reverting to small cell beekeeping and many hobbyist are moving towards [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hives]] in an effort to fight against this aggressive foe. Others are attempting to use mite resistant [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| races]] of bee with some success.

==Origin==
The Varroa mite was discovered in Southeast Asia in 1904, but now unfortunately spread mostly worldwide. More recently Varroa was discovered in 1987 within the US, 2000 in the North Island of New Zealand, 2007 in the South Island of New Zealand and to date, Australia is the only country free of this pest.

==Anatomy==
Varroa is approximately 1.00 to 1.77 mm in length and 1.50 to 1.99 mm. Its body closely resembles that of a tick, it has eight legs and the apparatus to pierce the epidermal layer of both adult and larval bees in order to feed. The mite is red-brown in color and wide and plainly visible to the naked eye when on brood, and can be more difficulty spotted, on some occasions, on the adult bee.

==Life Cycle==
[[Image:Vorroa Mite on pupa.JPG|thumb|right|Varroa Mite on Pupa]]
Within a hive mites can reproduce on a 10-day cycle. The female mite, after detaching from an adult bee, will enter the cell of an uncapped brood. The mite shows preference for the drone brood, but will select what is available. Once the cell is sealed, the female will begin to lay eggs and then expire. As the young bee develops, so will the mites. As soon as the new bee is able to leave its berthing cell, the mites attach themselves and start the cycle anew. The life cycle of the Varroa mite is dependant on the existence of brood within a colony. 

==Symptoms==
; Possible signs that a mite infection is underway may include, but is not limited, to the following
:*Mites obvious on brood, emerging bees, or foragers
:*Deformed bees
:*Discarded larva
;*Spotty brood pattern
:*Apparently sudden death of colony
:*Dead mites found near the entrance of the hive

==Detection==
If Varroa infestation is suspected, there is often nothing major lost by examining. However, a colony may be doomed if left unchecked. Checking for Varroa should be part of a beekeeper's regular regime. The following methods are some common ways to detect a possible mite infestation.
===Ether Roll===
The ether roll test is the grandfather of the [[#Sugar Roll| sugar roll test]], though effective it is not always the best method, as tested bees will die as a result.
#Using a wide mouthed jar, such as a mason or pickle jar, collect a sample of bees (not the queen) and fill the jar about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; full.
#Using ether, such as that from a can of carburetor starter fluid, apply a small amount to the bees (approximately a tablespoon worth). The inside of jar should be slightly moist with all bees at the bottom.
#Place the lid on the jar and roll bees for about 20-30 seconds.
#If done quickly, the jar may be opened and some of the bees may escape alive, though this is doubtful and the ones that do survive will be ready to sting.
#Examine the sides and bottom of the ether filled jar. If you count one or more mites, it is advised that you begin some sort of treatment. If you count around a dozen mites, it means you have a significant infestation, and should immediately begin treatment. If you find more mites than you can easily count, your hive is in serious trouble
#Dump remaining dead bees and clean the jar before next use.

;Notes
:#If you can do the either roll, there is little reason not to do the [[#Sugar Roll| sugar roll]] instead, as it is not lethal to the bees and is takes no more time.
;#Soapy water or 70 percent isopropyl (rubbing alcohol) can be used with varying success instead of ether.

===Drone Culling===
Unfortunately, the drone culling method kills drones to determine if there is a mite infestation. Despite this fact, culling drones is a quick and reliable method to check levels.
#Select a frame (or comb) with a large patch of capped drone brood. Gently remove adult bees from the frame and locate it to an easy to work area.
#Using a capping scratcher to remove the cappings from the selected brood cells. The drone brood within unfortunately must be impaled during this step.
#Mites will be plainly visible on the pupae as they are removed from their cells. Two to three mites on single pupae indicate a serious problem. Two to three mites per 50 pupae indicate a low to moderate infestation.
#Remove the culled brood, especially if heavily infected, or allow the bees to clean up after returning the frame to its original hive.

;Notes
:* Caped drone brood can be differentiate from capped worker brood as it has larger cells with slightly domed shaped capping. 
:* When returning the frame be sure to return it to its original hive, unless you are absolutely sure it does not carry any disease or mites.
:* The [[#Sugar Roll| sugar roll]] method for detection is a little more time consuming, but no bees must die for it to succeed.

===Sugar Roll===
The sugar roll method, also called the sugar shake method, is a technique that can be used to fairly reliably determine if bees have a Varroa infestation. In contrast to the ether roll and drone culling, when done properly there is no harm done to the bees in the sample.
#Using a wide mouthed jar such as a mason or pickle jar, cut a large hole in the lid and affix a rigid mesh from which bees can’t escape. Size 8 hardware cloth serves this purpose well. 
#With the jar open, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar to the bottom of the jar.
#Scoop the jar about one cup of bees (or 100 to 200 bees), being sure that you have not captured the queen. Quickly seal the jar with the lid you made.
#Covering the lid so as not to loose the sugar, give the jar several vigorous shakes, the more the better (to a point). This will surely aggravate the bees, but should not cause them any serious harm.
#Shake the sugar (and mites) out of the jar onto a piece of white paper or something with a similar white background. Set the jar of bees aside in the shade to calm down.
#If you count one or more mites, it is advised that you begin some sort of treatment. If you count around a dozen mites, it means you have a significant infestation, and should immediately begin treatment. If you find more mites than you can easily count, your hive is in serious trouble.
#Allow your recently jarred and jarred bees ten to fifteen minutes rest before returning them to the hive. This is mainly for the sake of the beekeeper, as the shaken bees may be ready to sting. Although some of your bees are now covered in sugar and appear to bee little ghosts, don’t worry. Their sisters are more than up to enjoying the task of cleaning the sugar off of them.

;Notes
:*Some keepers choose to use a modified sugar roll technique on entire packages of bees, but be sure not to do so to the queen, to avoid risk of injury. This technique is most useful when there is no brood, so it may similarly be stretched to include recently captured swarms. When brood is present, the treatment must be repeated several times at ten day intervals.
;*Although it is not often recommended to use powdered sugar in conjunction with bees due to anti caking agents that may be present, it should not be a problem with this technique to the little exposure actually obtained.

===Screened Bottom Board===
Simply installing a screened bottom board allows you to keep mite levels in check with out having to actively monitor.

;Notes
:* It is advisable to apply a sticky board, tacky adhesive, or a thin layer of Vaseline to the catch tray of the bottom board, so that live mites cannot return to the hive.
;* As with any passive technique, results are not instantaneous and therefore the results may not be dependable or the results may arrive at too late to be useful.

===Observation of Bees===
If you are easily able to observe mites on foraging bees, the colony is in trouble. Begin to remedy the situation as soon as possible.

==Methods of Control==
There exist many methods of controlling levels of Varroa mites, each with varying success. Unfortunately most methods are for control only, there may always be a level of mites once a colony has been infected. Only extremely drastic measure, such as culling the hive, can assure a zero mite population. 

Any controls using any sort of chemical device should not be used for up to 30 days prior to a honey flow that will be used for collection of honey for human consumption, unless otherwise noted. 

===Chemical Treatments===
====Apistan====
Apistan is a readily available plastic strip that is treated with a form of miticide. Users should follow the instructions present on the packaging. 
;Notes
:*Understand the instructions fully before applying
:*Do not apply when honey supers on the hive
:*Most commonly, 1 strip per 5 frames should be used, do not over medicate
:*Do not use strips for longer than the time stated on the packaging, this will and has caused mite resistance to the poison.
:*Wear protective gloves when applying and removing strips
:*Once used, do not reuse strips
:*Treatment timing is extremely important for success, do not use more than once in the fall and once in the spring.
:*Do not use in conjunction with [[#CheckMite+| CheckMite+]]

====CheckMite+====
CheckMite+ is similar to the product Apistan in the fact that it is miticide on a plastic strip. CheckMite+ however uses a different miticide that that which is present on Apistan strips. CheckMite+ should only be used if you Varroa mite infestation has proven to be resistant to Apistan. Users should follow the instructions present on the packaging. 
;Notes
:*Understand the instructions fully before applying
;* CheckMite+ should only be used if you Varroa mite infestation has proven to be resistant to Apistan
:*Do not apply when honey supers on the hive
:*Most commonly, 1 strip per 5 frames should be used, do not over medicate
:*Do not use strips for longer than the time stated on the packaging, this will and has caused mite resistance to the poison.
:*Wear protective gloves when applying and removing strips
:*Once used, do not reuse strips
:*Treatment timing is extremely important for success, do not use more than once in the fall and once in the spring.
:*Do not use in conjunction with Apistan

===Dusting===
A dusting of powdered sugar or wheat flour in conjunction with a [[Beekeeping/Screened Bottom Board| screened bottom board]] or a sticky board can cause mites to fall and be captured. Though this method can be used during honey collection, it should only be used as a last ditch effort. This must be repeated once a week for two to three weeks to make any kind of lasting effect.

;Notes
:*Only dust the adult bees, as open brood may perish due to dusting.  However it may be said that Dr Fakhimzadeh of Helsinki university has suggested that sugar DOES NOT has a negative effect on open brood and egg damage only seems to occur when dusting with sugar and Oxy-Tertra-Cycline (OTC) indicating that it is the OTC that is doing the damage.  Nevertheless Jim Fischer of WSBA points out that we should avoid open cells ready for laying as the queen will only lay in clean cells
;*This process must be repeated as it will not affect mites that are sealed in cells with brood or affect mites that are piggybacking on absent foragers

===Drone Culling===
Similar to the method of detection of the same name, drone culling can be used to reduce the number of mites infesting a hive. This process can be done as hone supers are on the hive.
#When starting a colony, use a sheet of drone brood foundation, per hive body. 
#Occasionally when the brood comb is full simply cull the drones by placing the entire frame in the freezer. 
#Once frozen comb has defrosted replace it in the hive to allow the bees to clean it and refill the comb.
#Repeat as necessary.

;Notes
:* If drone foundation is not available, take about an inch tall piece of normal foundation and simply used this as a starter strip by installing it on the top of a frame. This method allows the bees to create their own comb, though it may not always be successful in creating drone comb.
:*Instead of freezing, uncapped drone brood can be hung in order to feed local birds, but do not replace the frame in this instance as it will be more than likely destroyed by the appreciative birds.
:*Instead of freezing drone can be culled by heating, though this often readily becomes a waxy mess is not kept under control.

===Breaking Brood Cycle===
The act of breaking the brood cycle, by culling the queen, and allowing the bees to raise their own queen will prevent Varroa mites from laying eggs and thereby end their life cycle.

;Notes
:*Instead of culling a healthy and productive queen, she can be used to requeen a separate hive or begin a Nuc.
:*Instead of using a self produced queen, you can replace with a store bought queen, but you must allow for a natural broodless cycle
:*This method could be used during a honey flow, but a lack of new workers will cause it to be poor honey season.

===Grease Patties===
Using [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#Grease Patties| grease patties]] with or with out [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils| essential oil]] will cause a decrease in  tracheal mites. They are sometimes used as a varroa mite control method.
Though it is preferred to use patties with essential oils, it should not be done during a honey flow. To be effective, grease patties must remain on the hive year round.

===Essential Oil Treatment===
Using essential oil in a [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#Sugar Syrup| sugar syrup feed]] as been show to reduce mite levels. Syrup feed should not be supplied when honey supers are on the hive.

===Tobacco Smoke===
A heavy tobacco smoking in conjunction with a [[Beekeeping/Screened Bottom Board| screened bottom board]] or a sticky board can cause mites to fall and be captured. Though this method can be used during honey collection, it should only be used as a last ditch effort. This must be repeated once a week for two to three weeks to make any kind of lasting effect.

;Notes
:*When smoking, be sure that the smoke is not too hot, use cool smoke only
;*This process must be repeated as it will not affect mites that are sealed in cells with brood or affect mites that are piggybacking on absent foragers

===Formic Acid===
Formic acid is very caustic, and toxic to both bees and humans if not used properly. The liquid form of formic acid is somewhat dangerous to use, but is safe if handled carefully. Wearing gloves is essential.  Beekeeper supply houses may sell a time-release gel form that is easier to use and less toxic. 

;notes
:*Follow directions before using
:*Take caution in use as it is toxic to bees and beekeeper alike
:*When used, formic acid will also treat tracheal mites

===Food Grade Mineral Oil===
Some beekeepers use an electric or propane insect fogger to apply a mist of food grade mineral oil to their bees.  This has been shown to induce a grooming behavior in the bees which can reduce mite levels when combined with a screened bottom board.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think this should be cleaned up a bit.

Yes, that is true, the user Jclee has allready done a great job in correcting my terrible grammar.[[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]]

--

Not an official user, but I have a few areas that you can draw inspiration from, or use as a reference:[http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/DI/Chapter9.pdf Democratizing Innovation], [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ The Cathedral and the Bazaar] (Along with ESR's other OSS writings), and [http://www.demos.co.uk/proamrevolutionfinal_pdf_media_public.aspx The Pro-Am Movement]. 

It may be a good idea to add historic content and context to the book as well. That would require delving into things such as the foundation of the FSF and Wikimedia. Court battles should be included within this section, such as Eldred vs. Ashcroft. And the major players would need to be covered: Eric Raymond, Richard Stallman, Larry Lessig, The founders of Wikimedia &amp; Creative Commons (I am too much an OSS guy to know), etc, etc.

Another good source of content may be internet radio stations that are run completely by volunteers. Some include &quot;shows&quot;. Those that I have seen usually spring up around MMORPGs, but they are open collaborative efforts nonetheless. Examples include [http://www.eve-radio.com Eve Radio] and [http://www.radiofreezion.com/ Radio Free Zion].

-- Zak Jensen (zak.jensen AT gmail.com)

great ideas, I'll go over them a bit more in detail a bit later, for the moment I am really busy here at university. why don't you become a registered user and contribute a bit ? but thank you very much for your comments [[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]] 18:29, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

== Greetings ==

Hi there! This looks like a worthy project; I hope I get a chance to help out. I've passed word about this around to a few others; maybe they'll contribute too. Wanted to throw out a few ideas for sources:

* Lessig's [http://free-culture.cc/ Free Culture] is first in the canon -- probably other of his works, too
* Blogs: Once this project has a bit of a framework, maybe it could get some blog exposure to draw in new contributors? Additionally, blogs could be considered part of the ''source material'' of this book: they are sort of the &quot;newspapers&quot; of this subject.
* There are at least a few academics worldwide who either work in or study / have studied this subject. Soliciting their expertise could be an important way to get useful criticisms / contributions / editing. -- [[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 09:50, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

1) you're right about Lessig, I have to read the document through, havn't yet had the time, hope to do so this summer. 2) you're right, blogs are definitely part of the open culture movement, great idea. 3) Do you think that one could allready contact them ? people like Mr. Lessig would probably only accept to help if there is allready more content ? Thank's for your help. [[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]] 11:02, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

== Living, etc v ==

If there's a Work section (todo: collaborative and cooperative models of working? links with political theory and practice?), should there not also be a Living (or such) section for things like open architecture and sharing resources on social platforms? I'll try work on something soon.. --[[User:Milk|Milk]] ([[User talk:Milk|talk]]) 23:37, 19 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

===A note on pronunciation===
Danish words are rather difficult for English-speakers to pronounce correctly when given only the written form. Even after hearing the words being spoken, the sounds can be frustrating to reproduce. The [[Danish/Alfabet|pronunciation guide]] is an attempt to explain how the words should be spoken, but these rules are quite hard to follow when confronted with a word like ''Smørrebrødsjomfru'' (refers to a woman making something called &quot;Smørrebrød&quot;, which is a slice of dark bread with butter and a lot of fillings on top, like salad, fish, &quot;remoulade&quot; etc.).

Here's a very incomplete list of tips for the simple greetings in this lesson:

*'''Hej''' (&quot;''Hi''&quot;) = almost like the English ''Hi''. Sound sample [[Media:Hej.ogg]]
*'''Dav''' (&quot;''Hi''&quot; in a redneck manner) = say ''Dau''. Sound sample [[Media:Dav.ogg]]
*'''Goddag''' (&quot;''Goodday''&quot;) = the last ''g'' is silent. Sound sample [[Media:Goddag.ogg]]
*'''Godmorgen''' (&quot;''Goodmorning''&quot;) = &quot;''go-moarn''&quot;. The ''r'' is pronounced in the back of the throat, nearly silent. Sound sample [[Media:Godmorgen.ogg]]

==Hellos and Goodbyes in Danish==
Hellos:
 Hello!        ''Hej!''
               ''Hejsa!''
               ''Dav!''
               ''Goddag!''
 Good morning! ''Godmorgen!''
 Good evening! ''Godaften!''

Goodbyes:
 Goodbye!      ''Farvel!''
 Bye!          ''Hej hej!''
 Later!        ''Vi ses!''
 Good night!   ''Godnat!''

==Samtale 1 ~ Conversation 1==

Sofie and Louise are friends. They meet and talk about their day.

''Louise:'' Hej Sofie, hvordan går det?&lt;br&gt;
''Sofie:'' Det går godt, tak. Hvad med dig?&lt;br&gt;
''Louise:'' Jeg har det fint.&lt;br&gt;
''Sofie:'' Hvad så?&lt;br&gt;
''Louise:'' Ikke noget særligt&lt;br&gt;
''Sofie:'' Hej hej, Louise.&lt;br&gt;
''Louise:'' Vi ses.&lt;br&gt;

===Ordforklaringer ~ Vocabulary===

| Hvordan går det? / Hvordan har du det?

| How's it going? / How are you (Literally: &quot;How goes it?&quot; / &quot;How (do) you have it?&quot;)
|-
| Det går godt / Jeg har det fint
| =
| Well / I'm fine (Literally: &quot;It goes good.&quot; / &quot;I have it fine.&quot;)
|-
| Tak
| = 
| Thanks
|-
| Hvad med dig?
| =
| How about you? (Literally: &quot;What with you?)
|-
| Hvad så?
| =
| What's up? (Literally: &quot;What then?&quot;)
|-
| Ikke noget særligt
| =
| Nothing in particular (Literally: &quot;Not anything particular&quot;)
|}
|}

You can probably figure out the rest, with the help of the ''Hellos and Goodbyes'' table.

==Samtale 2==

Take a look at this short formal conversation to see how Danes address each other formally.

''Hr. Nilsen:'' Goddag! Hvordan har De det?&lt;br&gt;
''Hr. Klaaborg:'' Goddag! Jeg har det fint, tak.&lt;br&gt;
''Hr. Nilsen:'' Godt, Farvel!&lt;br&gt;
''Hr. Klaaborg:'' Farvel!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Voice sample (one voice) [[Media:Da-samtale2.ogg]]
===Ordforklaringer===
{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
|
{| cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;
| Hr.
| =
| Mister (mr.)
|-
| Frk., Frøken
| =
| Ms., Miss
|-
| Fr., Fru
| =
| Mrs., Missis
|}
|}

You may have noticed that hr. Nilsen referred to hr. Klaaborg as ''De''. This is the polite form for ''you'', as opposed to the casual ''du'', which Sofie and Louise used. This is rarely used in Danish today though, but can still be seen when people demand great respect, like, for example, the nobility.

==Pronominer ~ Pronouns==
The Danish pronouns shouldn't be too hard to memorize, as they are most of the time close to their English equivalents. '''vi''' = ''we'' and '''os''' = ''us'', for example.

==Immediate family==
====Forældre ~ Parents====
Just like in English, the Danish language has several words for ''mother'' and ''father''. Starting with the words for ''mother'', we see:
*'''Mor'''
And sometimes:
*'''Moder'''
The most common word for ''father'' is:
*'''Far'''
But occasionally
*'''Fader'''
is used.

====Søskende ~ Siblings====
The words for ''søskende'' (siblings) are for ''brother'':
*'''Bror'''
*'''Broder'''
and for ''sister'':
*'''Søster'''

====Børn ~ Children====
In Danish, the words for ''son'' and ''daughter'' are close to English. They are '''søn''' and '''datter''', respectively.

==The rest of the family==

*'''Onkel''' = Uncle, used mostly for a man married to a moster or faster
*'''Morbror''' = Mother's brother
*'''Farbror''' = Father's brother

*'''Tante''' = Aunt, used mostly about a woman married to a farbror or morbror
*'''Moster''' = Mother's sister 
*'''Faster''' = Father's sister

*'''Niece''' = Niece
*'''Nevø''' = Nephew

*'''Fætter''' = Male cousin
*'''Kusine''' = Female cousin

====Bedsteforældre ~ Grandparents====
Grandparents are also quite simple. Keep in mind ''mor'' is mother and ''far'' is father.

Maternal Grandparents:
*'''Mormor''' = Maternal grandmother
*'''Morfar''' = Maternal grandfather

Paternal Grandparents:
*'''Farmor''' = Paternal grandmother
*'''Farfar''' = Paternal grandfather

The Danish word for ''grandchild'' is '''barnebarn'''.

====Oldeforældre ~ Great-grandparents====
*'''Oldefar'''/'''Oldefader''' = Great-grandfather
*'''Oldemor'''/'''Oldemoder''' = Great-grandmother
The Danish word for ''great-grandchild'' is '''oldebarn'''

====Tipoldeforældre ~ Great-great-grandparents====
*'''Tipoldefar'''/'''Tipoldefader''' = Great-great-grandfather
*'''Tipoldemor'''/'''Tipoldemoder''' = Great-great-grandmother
The Danish word for ''great-great-grandchild'' is '''tipoldebarn'''.
* For every generation from this point forward you add another '''tip-''' to the title.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anyone have an outline for how this book should be organized? --[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 13:37, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Game Theory Handbook outline ==

Rough ideas on what should be here:

#Introduction
#What is a game? Definitions and classifications
#Non-cooperative games
#Bargaining theory
#Cooperative games
#Games in continuous state-spaces and differential games
#Auctions
#Mechanism design
#Appendix: theorems and proofs

Hey Chuck and whoever suggested the outline, I've been waiting here for a while for someone to get working on this book but it doesn't seem to be happening. If I get any spare time I'll try and add some stuff, but I think its probably pointless discussing stuff on the talk page now because no-one seems to be interested in this book anymore due to a lack of interest in writing it.

== Stuff moved from duplicate book [[Game theory]] ==

We will first look at the game theory by von Neumann and Morgenstein and then later study multiplayer games, nonzero sum games, games with chance, and finally, combinatorial game theory. - [[User:128.175.112.225|128.175.112.225]]

----

Is it on topic to include items on Combinatorial Game Theory, studying games such as Nim and such like? - [[User:Paul|Paul]]

----

The book should probably have some extensive information on evolutionary game theory.  Much has been written by Maynard Smith and others.  It seems EGT will be a big part of the future of GT. - [[User:67.162.52.102|67.162.52.102]]

== Edit war ==

We seem to have an edit war going on. I was going to use '/' rather than ':' as per [[WB:NP]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:50, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Dear god, I'm so sorry mate, having never been in something even near an edit war before (i seem to work on projects no-one else touches) I was a bit confused. Sorry. I think everything's sorted out now as per [[WB:NP]]...at least I hope so. Once again, sorry Aya...[[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

:Nah. My fault. I'm on the RC IRC server at irc://irc.wikimedia.org/#en.wikibooks so I can see every edit pop up as it happens. I shouldn't assume you see the same thing. :-) - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:07, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

== Ideas ==

There's loads of content from Wikipedia we could use here. Much of the stuff on [[w:Prisoner's dilemma]] seems too in-depth, so we could shift it to here. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:54, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, OK, Ii'll see what I can do. Thanks again. - [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, just had a look at [[w:Prisoner's dilemma]] and apparently it's a feature article over in Wikipedia, so the guys over there think its an excellent article and probably like the &quot;in-depth&quot; nature of it, even though I have to agree with Aya, it probably should be on Wikibooks. I might use it as a basis and expand from it. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:59, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

: Don't be afraid to fork the content. This is now allowed as per [[Wikibooks:About]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:08, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

In this section we attempt to teach you numbers and colors in Danish.

==Tal ~ Numbers==
The Danish number system can be confusing. Instead of saying ''twenty-one'', in Danish the equivalent is literally ''one-and-twenty''. This rule goes all the way up to the nineties. It can seem illogical at times, especially when reciting phone numbers. The hundreds, thousands, millions and so on are put in the same order as in English. If you want to say ''four thousand two hundred twenty-four'' it's ''fire tusinde to hundrede og fireogtyve'' which literally is ''four thousands two hundreds fourandtwenty''. Notice that there aren't any spaces in numbers below 100 when written in words in Danish, but numbers higher than 100 are split up in several words. Also notice that thousands are mentioned in plural because there's more than one (fire tusind'''e'''-).

This tutorial assumes that you have completed all previous tutorials.


==Method 1 ==
===Get the pictures of the model===
{{Tip|The images here do not line up. Some need to be rotated and others do not match in size. They will be kept so that you can get the &quot;real feel&quot; for this project.}}

If you have a puppy and a digital camera, take three pictures of the cute little rascal and upload them.  If you don't have a puppy, any object or small animal will do.  Ideally, the photos will be looking straight down at the top of the puppy, a side view, and a front view. It's important that the puppy be in the same pose in all three photos!  Or at least close to the same pose...we all know puppies don't stand still very long.

You could use two mirrors. One is placed next to the puppy at 45 degrees to the camera and 45 degrees to the puppy. Another is placed above the puppy, also at 45 degrees to the camera and 45 degrees to the puppy. This produces three images, one of the puppy ('''front \ NUM1'''), one of its reflection seen 90 degrees to the right ('''side \ right \ NUM3)'''), and one of its reflection seen from overhead ('''top \ NUM7''').  Take the photo from a long distance away with a zoom lens to get close to an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic orthographic projection].

Or how about pictures of a toy wolf taken from 6 view points?:

Using your favorite image editor, such as PhotoShop or the [[GIMP]] (see detailed GIMP instructions below: [[#Detailed steps to align images using GIMP|Detailed steps to align images using GIMP]]), down-scale the images need to a reasonable size (I made mine 512x384), and then match them to each other.  To match them, draw construction lines (pulled from the rulers above and to the left) on the left view for example to pick out key features.  I picked the tail, the front of the back foot, eye level, tip of the ear, and the front of the nose:

[[Image:Toywolf-construction-left.jpg]]

I found when I picked out these features that this first image needed to be rotated slightly.   That completed, I proceeded to scale, rotate and shift the other two views (top and front) until they matched fairly well as layers on top:

[[Image:Toywolf-construction-top.jpg]]
[[Image:Toywolf-construction-front.jpg]]

Once I had the proper results I saved the resulting images, and these are the ones we will use in Blender.

The results are the files you'll need for Step Two:

[[Image:Toywolf-left.jpg]]
[[Image:Toywolf-front.jpg]]
[[Image:Toywolf-top.jpg]]

Just right-click and save them some place where you can find them to load them into Blender for Step Two. You may notice the photos aren't perfect, but we'll use them just to show how you should deal with your real photos.  When you are creating your own pictures to import, note [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax parallax].  In this example, parallax is present, and we'll attempt to compensate.

===Get the Picture into Blender===
Getting the image into blender is the easy part. The more difficult part will be creating the mesh, but first things first. Create a new file (''File → New'') to see the familiar default objects. Don't bother deleting the cube, we'll end up using it in the tutorial. Just as was done in the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Aligning_Vertices_with_a_Guide_Image#Using_the_guide_images|&quot;Making A Pyramid&quot;]] section, split the 3D Viewer into four views and assign them the following view ports.  Note that the arrangement is different than that used in the previous tutorial.

:{| border=1 width=&quot;30%&quot;
|- align=center
|'''NUM7'''||'''NUM3'''
|- align=center
|'''NUM1'''||'''NUM0'''
|}

Each window will show you different XYZ coordinates with the '''NUM0''' view being what your object will look like to the camera object.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

Note:  More recent versions do this automatically when you press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|Q}}, but the default arrangement of the windows is different:

:{| border=1 width=&quot;30%&quot;
|- align=center
|'''NUM7'''||'''NUM0'''
|- align=center
|'''NUM1'''||'''NUM3'''
|}


Now that the screen is set up, let's load the images. In the top left viewport (XY), click ''View'' on the viewport's header (the menu at the bottom).  From the menu provided, select ''Background Image ...''.  A small window will appear.

{{Tip|If you have a later version of Blender and the ''Background Image ....'' option is missing from the View menu, try going to View &gt; Properties, or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}.  A new toolbar will open to the right of the viewport and by scrolling through you should see ''Background Images''.   Use the &quot;Add images&quot; bar and options will open up.  Then check the box to display your images. (Blender 2.58 user)}}


Click the ''Use Background Image'' button and several more buttons will appear. Now click on the folder icon located to the right of ''Image:''.  A new full-viewport window will appear.  Explore this window a bit and end up selecting the image file of the wolf from the top view. What you should get is the picture of the toy wolf from above with the default cube on top of it.  Rotate your view of the cube.  The picture disappeared!  But don't worry - the picture is still there.  Press '''NUM7''' to realign the viewport and see the picture again.

{{Tip|Be sure to be in orthographic view '''Num 5''' or else you won't see the picture.}}

Now load the front view of the wolf into the '''NUM3''' (right side) viewport (YZ) as you did the top view. Repeat the procedure and load the side view of the wolf into the '''NUM1''' viewport (XZ).  As a note, each picture is specific to the viewport it was loaded into.  When you switch between axes views, the picture will not change.  Try this out by changing the top left viewport to '''NUM3''' (right side) and '''NUM1'''.  Return the viewport to '''NUM7''' (top) before continuing.

'''Noob note:''' the photo from the top goes into top view, the photo from the front goes into the right view, and the photo from the right goes into front view, if you have front in front, change it now!

The pictures are now loaded into the Blender viewports.  If you look at the pictures on the grid, you may notice that the front view of the wolf isn't quite center.  That is okay, Blender has a way to fix it.

Move your cursor over the '''NUM1''' (front) viewport and press '''Shift + SpaceBar''', this expands the current viewport (NUM3/front view) to a fullscreen view, then open the Background Image window for the front view again.  Notice that there are picture manipulation options available.  One of these includes picture offsets.  Click on right side of the 'X Offset: 0.00' to increase the offset to 0.20.  The picture will be shifted over slightly so now the wolf is more centered. Press '''Shift + SpaceBar''' again to return to the four viewport view you created earlier.

'''Noob Note:''' If you made, and aligned your own photos, you will need to use a different value than '0.20' to center the head in the cube in front view.

The setup work is now done!  Let's start on actually making the wolf model.

[[Image:Wolftut1.png]]

===Create a Rough Model===
This is a brute force model creation using techniques discussed previously in this book.  This section is meant to help you explore and become more comfortable with them.  Do ''not'' try to follow the example to the tee.  Your wolf and my wolf will probably not look the same since you may want to add more or have less detail.

'''Noob Note:''' If you are just getting started with blender, this step  may likely take several hours to complete, since you must use your own creativity to position things in 3D space, using 2D views. Just like sculpting, drawing, or oil painting, it will be extremely fustrating at first, but once you get used to the way it works, &quot;modeling&quot; will be much easier.


The rough fit stage requires either some planning or on-the-spot decisions.  Think about where the wolf will have parts of its body flex or require parts jutting out.


The first step is to create a blocky wolf.  Start out with a column of blocks using the extrude face command (select face, '''EKEY''').  Don't worry about snapping the vertices to the grid since we are working with an organic figure.

'''''user note:''' I used '''ZKEY''' (wireframe view), to see better how the rough model fits out''

'''Figure 2.3.1''' Body column formation&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut2.png]]


The next step is to split the ears and legs off of the body.  Do this by subdividing the appropriate faces.  Save often, and if you make a mistake, go ahead and use the undo option ('''CTRL''' '''ZKEY''').  Also, if you find yourself looking at redundant faces, combine them ('''FKEY''').

'''Figure 2.3.2''' Appendage formation&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut3.png]]]

If you are having trouble with this, try mousing over the perspective window (the one you designated with NUM0) and using the MMB to rotate the view so that you are looking at the underside of the wolf. Click on the face underneath the wolf that is alongside his front legs (use the side view to check this). We are going to subdivide this face in order to grow legs off the new faces. To subdivide, press the WKEY and choose subdivide. You will see that the face has been divided into four. Take one of these faces and extrude it as many times as is necessary to make the right leg. Then do the same again for his left leg.

'''Noob Note:''' To avoid making the extruded faces share common vertices (and be connected to each other), either extrude the legs separately (as stated above) or select ''Individual faces'' in the Extrude pop-up menu. The same works for the ears.

Doing the ears is similar, except instead of working underneath you will start with the face on top of the wolf which is directly over the ears. Select this face and subdivide it once. Deselect everything using AKEY, then select one of these four faces and extrude it upwards once to make an ear. Do the same for the face alongside it to make the other ear.

Finally, extrude the tail end of the wolf one more time, so that your wolf has as many divisions as the picture above.

===Refine the rough model===
Let's start refining the model starting with the tail. Try putting your viewports in wireframe mode by pushing Z, it may make things much easier.  Line up the vertices over the wolf in each viewport by lasso selecting multiple vertices ('''CTRL LMB, Drag'''). then move to the right location with grab ('''GKEY''').

'''Figure 2.3.3''' Working on the tail&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut4.png]]


Continue onto the hind legs of the wolf.  It is trickier to manipulate the legs so keep rotating a viewport to look at the model from multiple perspectives.  Remember that we are working in three dimensions.

'''Figure 2.3.4''' Working on the hind legs&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut5.png]]


Continue working up along the wolf fitting the blocks to the pictures.  If you have problems seeing the picture because the model is in the way, let's hide the model.  In Edit Mode, select the entire model by '''AKEY''' or by pressing '''LKEY''' when you have the cursor over the model.  Simply pressing '''HKEY''' will hide the selected items.  To unhide the view, use '''ALT+HKEY'''.  By hiding and unhiding the model, or parts of the model, you should be able to keep using the picture as a guide.
''Note: It is much easier to just switch layers by, let's say, pressing '''2KEY''' (not the Num-Block one) to hide the entire model (thus getting a look at the picture) and '''1KEY''' to reveal the mesh again.''


Once you have the first pass done, you'll notice that the model just won't fit all three pictures correctly.  This is due to parallax.  The most obvious example is the side view.  The four feet should be level, as they are all standing on a flat surface.  Since they are not, we'll just ignore some of the aspects of each picture and continue with the model.  (This is a helpful example to show what you need to consider when taking your own pictures.)

'''Figure 2.3.5''' Completed rough fit&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut6.png]]

===Subsurf the model===

Now that the rough fit is done, let's smooth out the wolf.  Add a Subsurf modifier and set the Levels to 2.  The wolf will now be smoothed, but we want to add some of the hard lines back into the model.  This may be accomplished with creased edges.

First, turn on the view creased edges by toggling the ''Draw Creases'' button in the Mesh Tools 1 window.  Enter Select Edges or Select Faces mode ('''CTRL TAB''').  Highlight the edge or face you want to crease and press '''SHIFT + EKEY'''.  Use the mouse and pull away from the center until the Crease value is close to what you want.  A value of +1.000 will give you the sharpest look and is useful for places such as the bottoms of the paws.  When an edge has been creased, the edge will be highlighted in yellow (positive crease) or black (negative crease).  These highlights are shown due to the 'Draw Creases' button being turned on.

In this example, I creased edges along the paws, tail, ears, and nose to give them some sharpness.

'''Figure 2.4.1''' Creased edges&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut7.png]]


The last step is to refit the model to the pictures.  You may have noticed that when the model was smoothed, the result didn't quite fit to the pictures.  Now is a great time to tweak the vertices to fit to the pictures or add to/modify the model.

''N00b note: if you see a weird edge on the body after smoothing, check the face normals (F9 &gt; Mesh Tools More &gt; Draw Normals; and then W &gt; Flip Normals on the culprit faces).''

And here is my basic wolf based on three pictures!

==But where's the FOX?==
Somehow the fox from the title of this page turned into that beautiful wolf.  Now the wolf is a magnificent animal but I really like the fox.  So here is a quickie rendering of a fox, using techniques of this tutorial and some of the material techniques from a previous tutorial.

==Method 2 (using mirroring)==

In this alternative method we will do half a wolf and then mirror it to create a complete wolf. You should start out by creating a silhouette of the wolf body in the side view, and then in front view start to shape the wolf head, tail and legs...

'''Noob Note:''' If you are attempting this method, it is best to avoid using triangles in rounded areas of a Mesh, because they tend to cause artifacts in your model (artifacts are protruding edges or other things that don't look realistic). Using quads is a much better alternative. Triangles should only be used on flat areas of your mesh if they cannot be avoided.

[[Image:Wolf building side.jpg]] 
[[Image:Wolf building front.jpg]]

Here is what you  should end up with
[[Image:Wolf finished.jpg|400px]]

== Using mirroring with method 1 ==

You can also use mirroring with the first method (the one with cube extrusions).

This can speed up your work as you don't have to do the same changes on each side of the fox - just once.

To start the mirroring:
* Go to Editing ('''F9''')
* In the ''Modifiers'' panel, add a ''Mirror''
* Check only the ''Y'' button

When modeling:
* You may want to adjust the ''Merge Limit'' value (e.g. 0.14): this means vertices too close to each others (after the mirroring) will be merged, thus avoiding artifacts along the mirror's axis.
* Remove the faces along the mirror's axis, otherwise Subsurf will be confused by the faces ''inside'' the body of the mirrored fox.  Keep all the faces for the legs though.
* To move the legs differently on each side: when you're done modeling the rest of the fox, apply the Mirror modifier, and then work on each leg independently.

==Detailed steps to align images using GIMP==

From this point forward there are multiple ways to do exactly the same thing, however for simplicity's sake and so that I can be more detailed I will be using one method (the one which I use) and be using GIMP.

I found it best to size all the photos to a known width, with an easy to find center. (Mine happened to be 850x638 pixels, I don’t recommend that but you can choose any size you want really, as long as all of them are the same size). Then drag the construction lines to form a crosshair in the middle of the photo. To do this, click on the top ruler, and drag down to the middle (Exact middle) of the photo, then click on the side ruler and drag across to the middle (Again exact middle) of the photo. 

If you are having trouble finding the exact middle of the photo, move the cursor to the very bottom left of your photo and the height of your photo will be listed at the bottom left of the GIMP interface. The numbers are listed in an (x,y) format so you want the first number to say 0 and the second to be the largest you can make it by dragging your cursor. The second number is the height, and half of that is the middle of your photo. You can do the same with the top ruler to find the vertical middle of your photo. Only this time the co-ordinates at the bottom left of the GIMP interface should list the second number (y) as 0, and the first number should be as large as you can make it by moving your cursor (to the upper right of the photo).Once you have your width again half of that will be the middle of your photo.

Then using construction lines put one at the top of your object, and the bottom of your object. Find the &quot;height&quot; of your object by the distance between them. Remove the construction lines from the top and the bottom, and place a new construction line above the horizontal center line by the half of the &quot;height&quot;(of your object). Now place a construction line on both sides of your object and find the “width” (distance between the new vertical lines), then remove those construction lines and place a new construction line vertically half of the &quot;width&quot;(of your object) to the right of the vertical center line. Now cut the object out, and drag it so that the point you used as the &quot;top&quot; is on the horizontal construction line that is above the middle. Then Drag the photo left or right until the right edge of the object is on the vertical construction line you put in right of the middle construction line. 

Now the center of your object is at the center of your photo. This is a very important thing because when blender loads in the picture you will need this so that all of your pictures match up with each other 3d. You should repeat these steps with all 3 photos. I also don't recommend doing it in GIMP's &quot;layered mode&quot; as that caused more pandemonium for me. I recommend opening each photo in a new window .

Taking your pictures is the most important part, because if the pictures are not all in the same scale (object size to photo size) then your photos will not line up and you won't be able to place a dot on the same location from front view, side view, and top view. 

As a recommendation I would recommend making your first model from a Lego man. That is what I did and it is very simplistic easy practice. To take my photos I took about 10 minutes to construct a photo platform for my object. It consisted of a cardboard box with two sides cut out. I covered the inside area with computer paper. I then used a 2”x4” and a ruler to make sure that the box stayed the same distance from the camera for all shots, as well as marking where the Lego man’s feet were positioned inside the box with a pencil. This will provide good pictures, providing you keep the camera at the same distance and zoom for all three photos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric 

== Introduction ==
Social structure often has a major influence on the ways of communication, the impact, and style of all rhetoric. Visual rhetoric is not different in its impact and being impacted by society and different cultural values, ideology, and styles. Symbols and other components of visual rhetoric vary in meaning from culture to culture, and even sometimes within subgroups of cultures. This is reflected in the study of semiotics. [[Semiotics and Visual Rhetoric]] are in summary, signs that can have different quantifiers such as color, perspective, line, etc. These are dictated to a culture through different vehicles, the medians of rhetoric.

Cultural rhetoric is defined by the standards or values that culture attaches to things. This sort of value attachment can even vary within a culture and amongst different groups of people. We see in modern society in America that culture defines the roles of its entire membership and where an acceptable place in society is for these people. The struggle between sexes is one in particular that is perfect for this example. Culture has dictated in the past the placement of men above women, and therefore the power of men’s rhetoric over that of a woman. [[Gender and Visual Rhetoric]] roles are an ideal example of cultural rhetoric viewing the two genders as sub groups of the American culture.

Simply put, cultural rhetoric is a way of framing the words or ideology of a group through a lens that filters or can judge another group’s rhetorical power and value. Cultural rhetoric theories state that a culture is able to dictate values and standards through cultural rhetoric practice. With 
an interdisciplinary approach to understanding cultural theories of visual rhetoric, below is a more in-depth explanation of culture as understood by sociologists and communications scholars.

== Sociological-Cultural Theories ==
Culture affects how we see things. Different cultures perceive things differently. According to Laura Desfor Edles' ''Cultural Sociology in Practice'', “Culture” can be defined in several capacities; (A) humanistic and artistic activities, (B) the manner in which a particular group of people live, their way of life, (C) systems or patterns of shared symbols (1). It is this last method of defining “culture” with which we are most concerned. It is through these systems of shared patterns and symbols that individuals understand their environment, their reality, their life and everything related to their life.

=== Cultural Frames ===
Each individual has their own subjective frame through which they see reality. These frames are created through unique cultural experiences specific to the individual. Cultural frames reject an objective reality. Cultural frames shape how we see ourselves, others and our world. Cultural frames are cumulative they accumulate over time with experience and are constantly changing based on these experiences. The sum of our cultural frames is called our cultural prism. Because each individual experiences life through their own cultural frames, it can be said that there is no one universal objective reality. Each person has their own reality.

''How does this relate to visual rhetoric?''

Often, the focus in both learning as well as teaching visual rhetoric is the need to make certain universal claims regarding its power, uses and meanings. However, if we consider visual rhetoric from the “cultural frames” perspective, there is no universal application of visual rhetoric. Each individual’s cultural frames dictate how they use as well understand visual rhetoric. For example, consider traffic signs. Traffic signs vary from country to country and even sometimes from region to region. Depending on an individual's cultural background, he or she will understand traffic signs differently.

A Japanese &quot;bumpy road&quot; sign [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Japanese_Road_sign_%28Bumpy_road%29.svg] looks strikingly similar to the European sign for &quot;dip&quot; in the road [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Zeichen_112.svg]. Two different concepts represented by the same image in different geographical locations. The interpretation of these signs therefore will vary based on the cultural prism from which an individual views them. 

===Language is Arbitrary and Culture-Specific===

The language we use to describe our world is completely arbitrary. There is no reason that certain words represent certain things. There is no clear connection between the signifier (word/symbol) and the signified (“object in world”). But more importantly, the construction of language is extremely culture-specific. Not only do varying cultures use different words but also these cultures see words differently. For example, consider a tree, a tree can be seen many different ways from varied subject positions and cultural frames. For an environmentalist, a tree is something to be preserved, a relic. For a timber company, a tree is profit. For a politician, a tree can represent a political platform.

''How does this relate to visual rhetoric?''

Visual rhetoric can be considered a language, a visual language and similar to verbal language it is often arbitrary and definitely culture-specific. Consider brand logos. A company's logo is often well-recognized as representing a particular brand but it's actual connection to the brand is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the Starbucks logo ; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Starbucks_in_Nagoya.jpg#file]a green and white Nordic goddess has no relation to coffee products, the brand logo is arbitrary. In addition to being arbitrary, often logos are culture-specific as well arbitrary. While Starbucks is probably a universally recognized logo, an image such as the Duke Dog, James Madison University's mascot is not. The Duke Dog [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:James_Madison_University_3.jpeg]is a culturally-specific symbol, easily understood and recognized by the James Madison University (JMU) culture as their noble mascot and spirit guru, yet most likely considered just a dog to individuals outside the JMU culture. 

===Hegemony===

“The ideas of the ruling class are, in every epoch, the ruling ideas: i.e. the class, which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force (Edles 33).” This description of Hegemony is quoted by Edles from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' ''German Ideology''. Although the description sounds somewhat convoluted, Marx and Engel touch upon the important idea of the connections between the ruling class and the ruling intellectual force. Hegemony is a fairly simple concept with very complicated definitions. In essence, Hegemony is a theory regarding how dominant classes control the order of society by making their own views appear to be the accepted views. Subordinate classes accept certain ideas, actions or structures as natural when in reality they are actually social constructs created by the dominant classes. “Hegemony is thus the sum of the cultural processes through which ruling groups universalize their own worldview in order to emerge as dominant (Rumbo).”

''How does this relate to visual rhetoric?''

Deconstructing hegemonic constructs is extremely important when investigating any form of rhetoric. To understand certain forms of visual rhetoric, it is necessary to be aware of any potential hegemony. In addition, when participating in visual rhetoric one should be sure not to further any hegemonic constructs that may exist within the culture. Often, media perpetuates hegemonic structures by portraying individuals, the world and life as a particular way. While cultural groups such as African Americans, Hispanics and Asians continue to flourish within the United States, television, movies and advertising continue to portray America as a dominantly White society with little diversity. By constantly being exposed to often &quot;colorblind&quot; media, we accept it is as natural the Hegemony that The United States is a dominantly White country. In interpreting and creating visual rhetoric, it is important to keep in mind the potential Hegemonies.

==Communication-Cultural Theories==

Culture (from a communications standpoint) deals mostly with the rules that govern the understood, misunderstood, acceptable, unacceptable, expected and unexpected ways messages are relayed within a certain community. This community can be as small as an intimate group of friends or as large as a continent. The community is the culture. The message and it's delivery methods is the rhetoric. While theories on cultural rhetoric are usually explained in regards to verbal communication, they adapt well into visual rhetoric.

When verbal literacy is used, it follows guidelines set forth by the governing body and is designated as the national language. Visual literacy is also governed by culture specific values, but which are set for by national groups, they can vary. To be completely visually literate, one must understand all cultural aspects that may play a role in the interpretation of the image. This is where the knowledge and understanding of semiotics is important. The role of nonverbal communication in visual rhetoric connects closely to semiotics and the understanding of a visual argument.

Nonverbal behavior is typically analyzed in-depth in regards to communication. Nonverbal communication itself is culture-based. The cultures one associates with will influence their interpretation and use of non-verbal codes. Nonverbal cues, as explained by Mark P. Orbe and Carol J. Bruess in Contemporary Issues in Interpersonal Communications, can be split up into seven categories, four of which translate well into visual rhetoric (138). 

===Facial and eye communication===

Facial and eye communication through expressions can tell a lot about the message a person is conveying in a picture. The importance of the face can be traced back to the simple fact that when communicating verbally, a person typically looks at the communicator’s face for extra feedback. However, much of facial communication is culture bound (Orbe 142). The seven common facial expressions (sadness, anger, disgust, fear, interest, surprise, and happiness) are innate in people as children. Yet, as a person is socialized into their cultures as adults, these expressions are sometimes hidden or accentuated. For example, Asian cultures teach one to hide any highly emotional thoughts such as sheer excitement. In a painting, it is important to take note of the cultural setting of the characters because their facial expressions may be skewed to fit the culture.

===Proxemics===

Proxemics study the use of space in communications (Orbe 145). Proxemics are also highly culture bound. A photo of a mother and child in each other’s personal space, embraced in a hug automatically brings thoughts of intimacy to an American. This is because intimate distance (touching up to 18 inches apart) is considered primarily inappropriate in U.S. culture. A good example of the extent to this used in recent popular culture is the film, Borat, where a foreign man from Kazakhstan tries to introduce himself to Americans by invading their intimate space [http://flickr.com/photos/mattrothphoto/382360271/]. Borat is not welcomed by Americans who see this as an invasion of their personal space. Proxemics tie in closely with visual rhetoric because the distance between the two objects in a narrative representation may give clues to the relationship and argument conveyed.

===Physical appearance and artifacts===

Physical appearance and artifacts affect communications on a cultural level similar to facial and eye communication. This includes the choice of dress, choice of objects, decoration and the like. Even certain colors are more important than others in a culture (Orbe 154). For example, red, white and blue will have a different emotional connection to an American, Britain or Frenchman than to an Iraqi or South African. To an American, a photograph of a woman in a revealing dress will stimulate a different reaction than the reaction to the same photograph by a group of men from India. Similarly, in this photo [http://flickr.com/photos/webmink/71651/] of a Japanese wedding ceremony, the bride has her hair covered. Understanding that this has the same effect as wearing a wedding veil in western culture adds to the viewers understanding of the image.

===Environment===

The environment can be affected by culture in visual rhetoric. Architecture, room arrangements and colors fall into this category (Orbe 150). This relates closely to time and space in regards to visual rhetoric. Different cultures will react differently in certain environments. A person who grew up in the culture of the &quot;city that never sleeps&quot;, New York, will react to a painting of the Swiss Alps differently than a person who travels the world hiking and mountain climbing.

==Conclusion==

Culture is both influential in how a reader interprets visual rhetoric as well as how a writer composes visual rhetoric. Understanding how cultural theories can influence visual rhetoric is essential. Although this discussion included only Sociological as well as Communication-based theories of culture and visual rhetoric, these theories can be considered the underlying base upon which other cultural theories are developed and understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I wanted to talk about [[compiler construction]] book. I am the original author who started the book. It is very unfortunate that the book appeared abandoned to you. I've been quite busy, so I have not had a time to make progress. I am not sure if you are still working on the book; the history shows no work after February. Though I disagree on some points (surprise?), the bottom line is I am willing to follow your editorial decisions, if you are confident at what you are writing. Please see the talk page of the book for more specific comments. The book would require years of work, but I believe we can at least produce some pieces that are useful, if the book is incomplete. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|TakuyaMurata]] 23:27, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Analytic Number Theory is the application of Analysis to Number Theoretic Problems.  A quick overview of some portions of Analytic Number theory follow.

=== Zeta function ===
The zeta function defined by

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

for real values of s &amp;gt; 1, plays a central role in the theory.  It is straightfoward to show it converges absolutely when s &amp;gt; 1.  It satisfies the Euler product formula,

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the product is over all prime numbers.  To see this note that multiplying the series definition by 1-2&lt;sup&gt;-s&lt;/sup&gt; and rearranging terms(which is justified since the series converges absolutely) eliminates the even terms, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;(1-2^{-s})(1+\frac{1}{2^s}+\frac{1}{3^s}+\frac{1}{4^s}+\frac{1}{5^s}+\ldots) = (1+\frac{1}{2^s}+\frac{1}{3^s}+\frac{1}{4^s}+\frac{1}{5^s}+\ldots) - (\frac{1}{2^s}+\frac{1}{4^s}+\frac{1}{6^s}+\frac{1}{8^s}+\frac{1}{10^s}+\ldots)
=(1+\frac{1}{3^s}+\frac{1}{5^s}+\frac{1}{7^s}+\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise after multiplying by 1-3&lt;sup&gt;-s&lt;/sup&gt; all remaining terms with n divisible by 3 are eliminated.  After repeating this process for all primes it follows that 

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) \prod_p \left( 1-p^{-s} \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

since 1 is the only number not divisible by a prime and thus only the n=1 term is left. Solving for &amp;zeta;(s) immediately gives the Euler product formula.

=== Dirichlet series ===

The series for the zeta function is a special case of a Dirichlet series, that is a series of the form

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

Many important arithmetic functions, a(n), have the properties that a(1)=1 and a(m)a(n)=a(mn) when m &amp; n are relatively prime. Such functions are called multiplicative and their associated Dirichlet series may be expressed as an Euler product by

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}} = \prod_p \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a(p^k)}{p^{ks}}&lt;/math&gt;,

as can be shown in a manner similar to the proof for the zeta function.  A completely multiplicative function is one where a(m)a(n)=a(mn) even if m &amp; n are not relatively prime.  For a completely multiplicative function, the Euler product simplifies to 

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}} = \prod_p \frac{a(p)}{1-p^{-s}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The product of two Dirichlet series is given by the formula

&lt;math&gt;\left( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a(k)}{k^s} \right) \left( \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{b(m)}{m^s} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(a * b)(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

where (a * b)(n) represents the Dirichlet convolution of a &amp; b, which is defined by

&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(n) = \sum_{d|n} a(d)b \left( \frac{n}{d} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Some important Dirichlet series include:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\zeta^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s-k) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^k}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) \zeta(s-k) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_k (n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;
=== Big-Oh notation ===
Many problems involve functions that are incredibly difficult to work with exactly, but where the rate of growth of the function, rather than its exact values, is of primary concern.  Because of this a notation (often called &quot;Big-Oh notation&quot;) was invented. 

&quot;f(x)=O(g(x))&quot; is used to denote that for a sufficiently large number x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there exists a number C such that for all x&amp;gt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x)\right| \le C g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;f(x) = g(x) + O(h(x))&quot; is used to denote that f(x)-g(x)=O(h(x))

=== Dirichlet's Theorem ===
One of the first results proven with analytic number theory was Dirichlet's Theorem which states that for any 2 relatively prime integers a &amp; b, there are infinitely many values of k for which ak+b is a prime number.  The proof involves complex-valued functions of the set of integers called Dirichlet characters defined by the properties that &amp;chi;(n) depends only on its residue class modulo a, &amp;chi;(n) is completely multiplicative, and &amp;chi;(n) = 0 iff a and n are not relatively prime.  The principal character &amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be 1 when a &amp; n are relatively prime and 0 otherwise.  It is easy to show that &amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a character.  It can be shown that the number of characters is equal to &amp;phi;(a). It can also be shown that the sum of the values of &amp;chi;(n) over all characters &amp;chi; is equal to &amp;phi;(a) if &lt;math&gt;n\equiv 1\pmod{a}&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise.  The Dirichlet series corresponding to a character is called a Dirichlet L-series and is traditionally denoted by L(s,&amp;chi;).  It is simple to show that L(1,&amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) diverges. Through a complicated argument it is shown that L(1,&amp;chi;) converges and is nonzero if &amp;chi; is nonprincipal.  The function

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p\equiv b \pmod{a}} \frac{1}{p} = \sum_\chi \frac{L(1,\chi)}{\chi(b)} + O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

must diverge since L(1,&amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/&amp;chi;(b) diverges and the other terms all converge.  Since all terms of the sum on the left are finite its divergence implies there are an infinite number of terms of this sum and thus infinitely many primes of the form ak+b.

=== Riemann zeta function &amp; xi function ===
The zeta function introduced above(the Euler zeta function) converges for all values of s such that Re(s)&amp;gt;1.  The Riemann zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the Euler zeta function, and is defined for all complex values of s except s=1.  Where both functions exist, the Euler and Riemann zeta functions are equal by definition.  It can be shown that if the xi function is defined by

&lt;math&gt;\xi(s)=\frac{1}{2} s(s-1)\Gamma(\frac{s}{2}) \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}} \zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt;

then &amp;xi;(s)=&amp;xi;(1-s).  This is the symmetric form of the famous functional equation for the Riemann zeta function, and provides a convenient way of computing the Riemann zeta function when Re(s)&amp;lt;1.  

The series definition of Euler's zeta function shows that &amp;zeta;(s) has no zeroes for Re(s)&amp;gt;1. It can also be shown that the zeta function has no zeroes with Re(s)=1.  The functional equation shows that for integer values of n, &amp;zeta;(-2n)=0, and any other zeroes lie in the so-called critical strip, 0&amp;lt;Re(s)&amp;lt;1.  The well-known Riemann Hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeros(i.e. those not of the form s=-2n), have Re(s)=1/2.  It is easy to show that the zeroes of the xi function are exactly the nontrivial zeroes of the zeta function.

=== Hadamard product formula ===
The Hadamard product formula states that functions with certain properties(in particular the xi function) are close enough to a polynomial that they may be represented in terms of a product over the zeroes.  For the xi function the Hadamard product formula states that

&lt;math&gt;\xi(s) = e^{A+Bs} \prod_\rho (1 - \frac{s}{\rho})&lt;/math&gt;

for certain values of A and B, where the product is over the zeroes of &amp;xi;(s).  This formula is one of the main reasons the zeroes of the xi function, and thus the zeta function, are of considerable importance.

=== Distribution of squarefree numbers ===
Let S(x) denote the number of squarefree numbers less than or equal to x.  To evaluate this function we begin by counting all integers less than or equal to x.  Then we subtract those that are divisible by 4, those divisible by 9, those divisible by 25, and so on.  We then have removed numbers with 2 repeated prime factors twice those with 3 repeated prime factors 3 times and so on. To remedy the repetition of the numbers with 2 repeated prime factors we add on the number of integers less than or equal to x divisible by 36, those divisble by 100, those divisible by 225 and so on.  We have now reincluded those with 3 repeated prime factors so we uncount them.  Continuing this process gives

&lt;math&gt;S(x) = \sum_{n^2\le x} \mu(n) \left\lfloor \frac{x}{n^2} \right\rfloor = \sum_{n^2\le x} \mu(n)\frac{x}{n^2} + O(\sqrt{x}) = \frac{x}{\zeta(2)} + O(\sqrt{x}) = \frac{6}{\pi^2}x+O(\sqrt{x})&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to information about how common squarefree numbers are this estimate gives information on how they are distributed.
For example to show that there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive squarefree numbers(i.e. that differ by 1) assume there are only finitely many such pairs.  Then there is some x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that all such pairs lie below x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then for n &amp;gt; x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; n and n+1 cannot be squarefree, and thus at most half the integers above x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are squarefree, or more precisely,

&lt;math&gt;S(x)\le \frac{1}{2}(x-x_0) +x_0 + 1 = \frac{x}{2} + O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

but since &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{\pi^2} &gt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; this contradicts the estimate obtained earlier, thus there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive squarefree numbers.

The estimate also shows that for large enough x, there is at least one squarefree number between x^3 and (x+1)^3.  To see this not that the number of squarefree numbers in that range is

&lt;math&gt;S\left((x+1)^3\right) - S(x^3) = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \left( (x+1)^3 - x^3\right) + O\left(\sqrt{(x+1)^3}\right)+O\left(\sqrt{x^3}\right) = \frac{18}{\pi^2} x^2 + O \left(x^{3 \over  2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is at least one for sufficiently large x.

To do: Add mention of prime number theorem and sieve methods, as well as Dirichlet inversion

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Top bar hives are a style of man made beehive that is based on a cavity covered with sticks or slats usually of wood. Top bar hives have been around for centuries. Evidence of them can be found in ancient Greek and roman ruins. Top bar hives are very popular in undeveloped regions due to ease of construction with materials at hand. Top bars have recently received a surge of popularity in the hobbyist sector of beekeeping all over the world as green alternative to modern stacked white boxes seen everywhere. There are two main classifications of top bar hives the [[Beekeeping/Kenya Top Bar Hives| Kenya Top Bar Hive]] and the [[Beekeeping/Tanzania Top Bar Hives| Tanzania Top Bar Hives]].--[[User:Gary Piant|Gary J Piantanida]] ([[User talk:Gary Piant|talk]]) 18:18, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

==Characteristics==
The two main types of Top Bar Hive in use today are distinguished by their shape and origin. The Kenyan TBH or KTBH has sloped sides resembling a trough and Tanzanian TBH or TTBH which is shaped like a rectangle. What’s the difference?  It is rumored throughout the beekeeping world that sloped sides would prevent the bees from attaching comb to the side walls making it easier to work. To set the record straight these hives have been in existence for centuries and are very popular in third world countries due to ease of construction with materials at hand. In Kenya they are built from hollowed out logs cut in half, sloping the sides was an early attempt to mimic this shape with modern building materials. Most modern beehives are built square the Tanzanian version adapted the bars to more modern square building materials.
	Currently there are no specific dimensions. The average TBH is 4 feet long and 1.5 to 2 feet wide. The KTBH is narrower at the bottom, but no two beekeepers will build them the same. 
Unlike most common designs of modern hives, the top bar hive does not use wooden frames to hold the comb, it uses slats of wood, or (top bars) placed over the cavity the bees inhabit, which is also how the hive received it’s name. Instead of filling out wooden frames, the bees attach comb to the slats. The slat is the only means of support that comb has in a top bar beehive. Also, unlike most other hive designs, the top bar hive does not impose artificial segregation of the colony by physically dividing honey comb from the brood comb by use of separate [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]], divided by a Queen excluder preventing the Queen from using the entire colony to rear brood. The TBH allows the Queen access to the entire colony as she would have in a wild colony.

==Advantages==
Top bar hives have some advantages over traditional hive designs. 
===Simplicity of Design===
Because of the simplicity of the top bar hive’s design, one can be built from readily available salvage materials. In fact the design of a top bar hive is so adaptable that boxes, 55-gallon-drums, old crates and even dilapidated refrigerators can be used to house bees. In essence, nearly any large enough container can be modified to produce a productive top bar hive. All that is required for a top bar hive to be successful are fitting top bars, a water and wind tight cover, an entrance and healthy bees. It is also important to note that the only part design that needs to be precise is the width of the top bar which will be discussed later in the book. Bees are happy to use just about any suitable cavity to establish a colony.

===Price of Construction===
Because of the ability to design and construct TBH hives from scrap and other recycled materials, they can be built extremely inexpensive when compared to other hive designs. When choosing to purchase materials, the total cost of construction will be a fraction of what it would be to build or buy the necessary equipment to start with conventional framed hive styles, due to simplicity of design.

===Ease of Operation===
====Opening the TBH====
Unlike the [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth]] style of hive, the top bar hive does not require lifting heavy [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]] full of bees and honey, commonly referred to as 'supers&quot;. A TBH is accessed by removing the cover exposing the top bars themselves. Because top bars are pushed tightly together there are no gaps for bees to emerge from, the top bars form the ceiling of the hive. Once exposed one top bar at the rear can be worked loose with a hive tool or pocket knife and lifted from the hive body now exposing the adjacent comb. The bar just removed leaves behind the gap the beekeeper will use to manipulate other bars. This bar may or may not have comb suspended from it, if it does it needs to be handled with care. Never turn the comb parallel to the ground as if you were holding a plate of food in one hand, this will cause the comb to break and fall. This comb should be placed in another hive body or on a device made to rest it on while the beekeeper continues working.

====More Manageable Bees====
It has been said by some that manage both top bar hives and [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth hives]] that managing top bar hives is more pleasant as the bees are less stressed when worked and less likely to exhibit defensive behavior. The combs on a top bar hives can be manipulated a few at a time. This smaller disturbance means that inspections exposes and disturbs a much smaller segment of the hive at any given time. Bees in and on the unexposed portion of the hive tend not to notice the beekeeper’s intrusion and as a result seem not to become alarmed.

====Comb by Comb Management====
The ease of comb-by-comb management is due to the horizontal nature of a top bar hive. Combs only need to be disturbed if they are specifically to be managed, this means that if it is desired to increase the brood nest, then simply a new top bar must be installed. Beekeeper can also harvest small portions of comb honey at a time, by simply cutting and removing the desired segment, and then replacing the top bar.

===Storage===
Unlike with standard [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth hives]], there is no extra storage, other than unused top bars, for a top bar hive. Every part of the hive may remain in or on the hive unlike the extra [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]] associated with Langstroth type or &quot;vertical&quot; hives. Less storage means more places to keep bees.

===Bees Wax Production===
Due to the nature of the top bar hives design, combs are not reused as in a framed hive. This facilitates a larger harvest of bees wax. Combs full of honey only are harvested from the rear. The wax is simply crushed by whatever means the beekeeper determines efficient. The crushed wax is then saved and rendered for sale.

Another source of wax comes from the regression process (See regression section) Through the process known as &quot;regression&quot; the brood nest is removed at the beginning of each season to be measured to monitor colony progress and viability for breeding. Once all necessary measurements are recorded this wax is also stored for rendering. 

It is advisable to store wax removed from the brood nest separate from wax that contained only honey. The wax from the brood nest contains cocoons, pollen, and debris tracked in by the bees that contaminate the purity of the wax. The lighter in color the wax the less impurities it contains fetching a higher price in the retail market.

There are many different ways of rendering wax. The two most preferred ways are by use of a solar melter or boiling the wax in large vats of water. Both processes require melting the wax and filtering the debris and allowing it to cool in a container.
Once cooled the debris which settles to the bottom can be scraped off.

===Comb Honey Production===
The top bar hive is by design ideal for &quot;comb honey&quot; honey cut from and which remains in the comb and is often considered more valuable by honey connoisseurs than honey which has been extracted from the comb and bottled. If desired however, a fruit press can be used to separate the liquid honey from the wax comb, such as that produced by a honey extractor.

===Natural Comb===
Because the bees completely build the comb with out using a foundation, top bar hives produce natural sized brood cells, which are advantageous regarding mite control. The wax is also cycled out of the hive during harvest so the hive doesn't accumulate pesticides or other contaminants.

==Disadvantages==
Because they are managed differently to framed hives, inasmuch that honey tends to be harvested a little at a time rather than all at once, top bar hives are less attractive to the commercial beekeeper, who wants to maximize profits by minimizing time spent in harvesting. Other than that, top bar hives have no real disadvantages over framed hives, especially for the smaller-scale beekeeper. During seasons with heavy nectar flow, beekeepers may need to harvest bars of honey more often to prevent the hive from becoming honey bound.
 
===Non-Standard Equipment===
There exist no real standards for top bar hives, because of this the beekeeper must be responsible for construction the top bar hive. However, the existence of standards has frozen the development of beekeeping sometime in the nineteenth century, so this is hardly a disadvantage. On the contrary, the fact of there being no standards has encouraged creative experimentation among top bar beekeepers, who many now regard as being at the leading edge of beekeeping development.

===Less Honey Harvesting===
There is a belief among framed-hive beekeepers that top bar hives are less productive, but no evidence for this has been produced. Wax production, on the other hand, tends to be higher, as comb is not returned to the hive after extraction. This, in itself, is beneficial in terms of disease control, as no potentially disease spore-bearing comb finds its way back into the hive. 

===Delicate Comb===
Because no wired wax foundation is used, there is no reinforcement to the natural structure of the comb. This means that new comb must be handled carefully to avoid breakages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Portuguese|Return to Portuguese]] &amp;ndash; [[Portuguese/Contents|Return to Contents]] &amp;ndash; [[Portuguese/Contents/L1/Lesson_Two_-_I_Like...|Go to Lesson Two]]

Welcome to the Portuguese Language Course Wikibook. Good luck - or should we say, {{Word|pt|boa sorte}}!

==Dialogue 1==
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;background:#FFF0F0;&quot;
|
'''Ricardo''': Bom dia. O meu nome é Ricardo. Como está? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Bem, obrigado. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Estou bem, obrigado. Qual é o seu nome? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': O meu nome é João. &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Muito prazer. &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
|}

Analysing each sentence:

* '''{{Word|pt|bom dia|Bom dia}}''' -  translates as (&quot;good day&quot;), but is normally used until 12PM as a short form of &quot;boa manhã/madrugada&quot;(&quot;good morning&quot;) and never after sun down.
Other greetings include:
* {{Word|pt|boa tarde|'''Boa tarde'''|g=good afternoon}}
* {{Word|pt|boa noite|'''Boa noite'''|g=good evening, good night}}.
* {{Word|pt|olá|'''Olá'''|g=hello}} - informal.
* {{Word|pt|oi|'''Oi'''|g=hi}} - informal.
----
* '''O meu nome é Ricardo''' - My name is Ricardo (&quot;Richard&quot; could also be used if pronunciation is an issue).
** {{Word|pt|o|'''O'''|g=the|p=/u/}} - masculine singular definite article;
** {{Word|pt|meu|'''meu'''|g=my|p=/mew/}} - masculine singular first-person singular possessive pronoun;
** {{Word|pt|nome|'''nome'''|g=name|p=/ˈno.mɨ/}} - masculine noun;
** {{Word|pt|é|'''é'''|g=is|p=/ɛ/}} - third-person singular present indicative of verb {{Word|pt|ser|g=to be}};
** {{Word|pt|Ricardo|'''Ricardo'''|g=Ricardo|p=/ʁi.ˈkaɾ.ðu/}}.
* Note that the direct translation would be “the my name is Ricardo.” But in Portuguese you can optionally use the definite article (English ''the'') before possessive pronouns (English “my”, “our”, “his”, etc.;) This sentence is equivalent to “''Meu nome é Ricardo''.”
* In informal language, or in spoken language in general, &quot;Chamo-me João&quot; similar in context to the use of &quot;I'm João&quot;, a more direct translation would be &quot;I'm called João&quot;. João can also be changed into John. 
----
* '''Como está?''' - “How are you?”
** {{Word|pt|como|'''Como'''|g=how|p=/ˈko.mu/}}
** {{Word|pt|estar|'''está'''|g=you are; well|p=/ɨʃ.ˈta/}}
* In this type of situation, the inquiry about someone's state may only be a show of politeness and consideration, an implicit request to engage in personal conversation and an acknowledgment of the other's presence, rather than explicit probe into private matters. The targeted (it may be directed to a group &quot;Como estão?&quot;) is given the opportunity to refuse engagement by keeping the answer simple and positive, like in the example or elaborate and explain if the deeper personal relation is reciprocal or welcomed. This of course depends on the social environment where it takes place...
----
João then answers:

* '''Tudo bem, obrigado. E você?''' - “All right, thank you.”
** {{Word|pt|obrigado|'''Obrigado'''|g=thank you}} - this can only be used by men. If you are a woman, you must use {{Word|pt|obrigada}} instead.
** {{Word|pt|e|'''E'''|g=and}}
** {{Word|pt|você|'''você'''|g=you}} - this is the second-person singular formal pronoun. Despite being second-person, verbs following it are conjugated in the third-person. The informal second-person pronoun is '''{{Word|pt|tu}}'''.

===Articles===
The English language has three articles: ''the'' (definite article), ''a'' and ''an'' (indefinite articles). Portuguese has four definite and four indefinite articles, as they inflect in [[#Gender|gender]] and [[#Number|number]].

The definite articles are:
* {{Word|pt|o|'''O'''|g=masculine singular|p=/u/}}: ''o homem'' - “the man”
* {{Word|pt|os|'''Os'''|g=masculine plural|p=/uʃ/}}: ''os homens'' - “the men”
* {{Word|pt|a|'''A'''|g=feminine singular|p=/ɐ/}}: ''a mulher'' - “the woman”
* {{Word|pt|as|'''As'''|g=feminine plural|p=/ɐʃ/}}: ''as mulheres'' - “the women”

The indefinite articles are:
* {{Word|pt|um|'''Um'''|g=masculine singular|p=/ũ/}}: ''um homem'' - “a man”
* {{Word|pt|uns|'''Uns'''|g=masculine plural|p=/ũʃ/}}: ''uns homens'' - “some men”
* {{Word|pt|uma|'''Uma'''|g=feminine singular|p=/ˈu.mɐ/}}: ''uma mulher'' - “a woman”
* {{Word|pt|umas|'''Umas'''|g=feminine plural|p=/ˈu.mɐʃ/}}: ''umas mulheres'' - “some women”

Note that the indefinite plural article translates as English ''some''.

===Gender===
The English language has three genders: masculine (''he''), feminine (''she'') and neuter (''it''). Portuguese has two, but, unlike English, all nouns and most pronouns have a gender, even inanimate things like {{Word|pt|casa|g=house, feminine}} and {{Word|pt|ouro|g=gold, masculine}}.

Grammatical gender in Portuguese aren’t always the same as the object’s real gender. For example, {{Word|pt|criança|g=child}} is always a feminine word, whether you are referring to a boy or a girl.

The Portuguese genders are:
* '''masculine'''; and
* '''feminine'''.

As a Portuguese learner, you must memorise the gender of every word. In most cases, the gender of a word can be identified by its ending:
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-o|'''o'''}} are usually masculine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-a|'''a'''}} are usually feminine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-ção|'''ção'''}} are usually feminine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-dor|'''dor'''}} are usually masculine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-ente|'''ente'''}} and {{Word|pt|-ista|'''ista'''}} are usually used for both genders;

===Number===
Like English, Portuguese words can be singular or plural. Portuguese plurals end in '''s'''. Usually the following rules apply:

* Singulars ending in vowels pluralise with '''s''': {{Word|pt|carro|g=car}} → {{Word|pt|carros|g=cars}};
* Singulars ending in '''r''', '''z''' and '''n''' pluralise with '''es''': {{Word|pt|mar|g=sea}} → {{Word|pt|mares|g=seas}};
* Singulars ending in '''s''' pluralise with '''es''' if the stress is in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|país|g=country}} → {{Word|pt|países|g=countries}}; they are the same when plural if the stress is not in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|atlas|g=atlas}} → {{Word|pt|atlas|g=atlases}};
* Singulars ending in '''m''' pluralise with '''ns''' replacing the ''m'': {{Word|pt|bem|g=good}} → {{Word|pt|bens|g=goods}};
* Singulars ending in '''x''' are the same when plural: {{Word|pt|tórax|g=thorax}} → {{Word|pt|tórax|g=thoraxes}};
* Singulars ending in '''il''' pluralise with:
** '''is''' replacing the ''il'' if the stress is in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|canil|g=kennel}} → {{Word|pt|canis|g=kennels}};
** '''eis''' replacing the ''il'' if the stress is not in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|míssil|g=missile}} → {{Word|pt|mísseis|g=missiles}};
* Other singulars ending in '''l''' pluralise with '''is''' replacing the ''l'': {{Word|pt|jornal|g=newspaper}} → {{Word|pt|jornais|g=newspapers}};
* Singulars ending in '''ão''' pluralise with:
** '''ões''' replacing the ''ão'' (most common): {{Word|pt|opção|g=option}} → {{Word|pt|opções|g=options}};
** '''ães''' replacing the ''ão'': {{Word|pt|pão|g=bread}} → {{Word|pt|pães|g=breads}};
** '''s''': {{Word|pt|mão|g=hand}} → {{Word|pt|mãos|g=hands}};

===''Ser'' and ''estar''===
Let's analyse the third line, in which Ricardo answers:
 
'''Estou bem, obrigado.''' - “I am fine, thank you.”

The meaning of ''bem'' and ''obrigado'' have already been explained. The other word, {{Word|pt|estou}} means '''I am'''. It is one of two verbs that translate to our English ‘I am’, the other being {{Word|pt|sou}}.

Consider the following English phrases and their Portuguese translations:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|I '''am''' old. || Eu '''sou''' velho.
|-
|I '''am''' here. || Eu '''estou''' aqui.
|-
|I '''am''' furious. (''I am furious right now'') || Eu '''estou''' furioso.
|-
|I '''am''' furious. (''I am a furious person'') || Eu '''sou''' furioso.
|-
|I '''am''' wearing a hat. || Eu '''estou''' vestindo um chapéu.
|-
|I '''am''' infected. || Eu '''estou''' infectado.
|-
|I '''am''' diabetic. || Eu '''sou''' diabético.
|}

''Estou'' is a form of {{Word|pt|Estar}} and ''sou'' is a form of {{Word|pt|ser}} and both verbs translate as ''to be''. For a Portuguese learner, it is important to know when to use one and when to use the other:

* '''Estar''' implies that something is temporary, that it can be changed. It is used, for example, for being somewhere, for being wearing something, for having a curable disease, for being in a certain state of mind.
* '''Ser''' implies that something is unlikely to change. It is used, for example, for being a certain nationality, for being young, old, a teenager, an adult, etc., for being always big or small, for having an incurable disease.

There some exceptions to these rules. For example, “I '''am''' dead” is “Eu '''estou''' morto.” even though the fact someone is dead is unlikely to change.

'''Estou''' is a form of the verb '''estar'''. Confused? Think of a verb like a tree. On the trunk there's the verb's name - this is called the infinitive. Some examples of infinitives are...

&lt;pre&gt;
 ESTAR      -     SER    -     TER   -    COMER    -    FALAR    -    ABRIR
 To be in        To be       To have      To eat       To speak      To open
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we have to imagine the branches of the tree. Each branch is a different TENSE of the verb. Example? 'I am running' is ''present continuous tense'' because it is happening NOW whereas 'I was running' is ''past continuous tense'' because it happened in the PAST. 

Finally, the leaves on the branches are different CONJUGATIONS. Example? We say 'I run' and 'you run' but 'he/she/it runS' with an 's' on the end. This is a different conjugation of the present indicative tense of the verb 'to run'. However in Portuguese there are more conjugations than in English.

Let's take a look at the conjugations for the verb ESTAR. We already know that one of them will be 'está', from the dialogue.

&lt;big&gt; '''ESTAR - To Be in''' &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Look back at the dialogue. Ricardo says '''Estou bem'''. We can see that the first word means 'am'. '''Bem''' simply means 'well'. So we have 'Am well.' We seem to be missing the 'I'! However, in Portuguese, because there are different conjugations for the different people, you can often leave out the 'I, we, they' etc. if it is obvious. In the case of 'I' and 'we' it is always obvious in the present tense.

There's also always a bit of confusion at the start between the different forms of 'you'.

*   '''Tu''' – This is really mostly used in Portugal, and some regions from Brazil. It is a really casual way of saying ‘you’ – used between close friends or to children. If in doubt, don’t use it, use 'o senhor/a senhora' (masculine/feminine).
*  '''Você''' – It only refers to one person. Used in informal speech mainly in Brazil.
*  '''Vocês''' – Plural form of ‘tu’ or ‘você’.

There is also one other form of you: '''Vós'''. However this form is less used and is mostly used by people in Northern Portugal and in classic literature. Therefore we shall ignore this form of &quot;you&quot;. However if you need to understand it, the grammar references on this Wikibook include '''Vós''' - which, I should point out, is like '''vocês''' -  it is currently only used when talking to more than one person. Still confused? Check out the [[Portuguese/Contents/Personal Pronouns of Subject|Personal Pronouns of Subject]] page.

'''Muito prazer''' means ''It's a pleasure''.

'''Adeus''' means ''goodbye''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I liked your suggestion!!!

Are you working on this... or is this just an idea? Do you have the support of the Wikivarsity community?
[[User:SudarshanP|SudarshanP]] 05:22, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

----

Thank you!

Yes, I'm actually working on it, although slowly.
Since the idea has not boiled enough I cannot simply implement it, so I'm elaborating it and it evolves from time to time. I'm also thinking about writing an article and sending it to some CS journal.

Unfortunately, there is no support whatsoever. Your comment is the only one I have.
--[[User:Catpad|Catpad]] 07:51, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I thought I would leave a note to say I found your idea of Odzilla very interesting. It's true to say that many courses could use the same base materials (or different &quot;flavours&quot; of these as you say) and this could save us having to repeat these materials. However, each course will have it's own focus and learning outcomes, so i think we may need to overlap some material - just as many Wikipedia articles overlap to some extent with other articles in the same area. But I don't think I fully understand this idea yet, so I'll give it another go..

:As for &quot;support&quot; - don't worry - things happen slowly (and have been moving far too slowly in Wikiversity in my opinion) but good ideas will get recognised in time. As we know, Wikiversity is in a kind of limbo at the moment, but I for one am going to try to revive it somewhat, or at least start studying it for my PhD to make some recommendations. On that note, if you feel confident enough, you should definitely try to write a paper and publish it somewhere visible to the wikimedia community, even if a journal won't have it. 

:Good luck. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 12:58, 7 October 2005 (UTC)


==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The NAIC&amp;reg; Stock Selection Guide&amp;reg; is a form designed by the 
National Association of Investors Corporation to help evaluation 
potential investments in individual common stocks.  It uses 
fundamental analysis to evaluate potential investments for both 
growth and value.

==Identifying Quality Growth Companies==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate historical growth trends in revenue (sales), pre-tax profit (PTP) and earnings per share (EPS).  For each of these you want to see relatively consistent compound growth.  You also want to see all three growing at similar rates.

This is also where you make judgment decisions to estimate the potential future sales and EPS values.  This potential future EPS value is produced either from an estimated future EPS growth rate or from an estimated future income statement.  The later method is referred to as &quot;preferred procedure&quot; (which does not necessarily suggest that it's always to be &quot;preferred&quot; over the former method.

==Evaluating Management==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate trends in historical pre-tax profit margins (pre-tax profit as a percentage of revenue) and return on equity.  For each of these you want to see stability or improvement as well as superiority when compared with other companies in the same industry.

==Evaluating Past P/E Ratios==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate the current PE level in the context of historical PE levels.  The historical PE levels help establish a &quot;typical&quot; level and range of PE values specific to this stock (sometimes refered to as a &quot;signature PE&quot;).  Current PE level is compared with this &quot;typical&quot; level to produce Relative Value (RV), which is the current PE level expressed as a percentage of the typical historical level.

The concept of PE (Price divided by Earnings, or PE ratio) is sometimes likened to price-per-pound (or unit pricing) in a grocery store.  Unit product pricing allows you to compare the value of the underlying product without regard to the price of that product when packaged in various quantities.  PE ratio allows you to compare the &quot;per-pound&quot; price of the underlying &quot;product&quot; (the level of EPS produced by the company) without regard to how the product is packaged (as shares).  

To determine the value of bananas in the grocery store (regardless of how many bananas you plan to buy) you need to know how much it costs to buy one pound of bananas (price per pound), not how much it costs to buy one banana or one bunch of bananas.  To help determine the value of a stock investment you need to know how much it costs to buy one dollar of EPS produced by that company (price per &quot;pound&quot;), not how much is costs to buy one share of the stock.  Buying one share of stock is like buying one banana;  PE ratio is like the price per pound of the bananas.

==Evaluating Potential Future High and Low Prices==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you establish a potential future high and low price.  These are compared with the current price to estimate both a potential &quot;up-side&quot; (how much the price might go up) and a potential &quot;down-side&quot; (how much the price might go down).  US/DS Ratio is the &quot;up-side&quot; as a percentage of the &quot;down-side&quot;, a way or measuring the risk of the investment.

==Evaluating Potential Future Total Return==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate the overall potential for gain over five years from investing at the current price.  This is done by combining the potential for price appreciation over five years (the &quot;up-side&quot; described earlier) with an estimate of future dividend yield (if any).  This overall potential for gain is represented as an annualized five-year rate of growth and is refered to as &quot;Total Return&quot;.  The level of Total Return required to double an investment over five years is approximately 15% (14.870%).

==Total Return vs. Projected Average Return==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Total Return (TR) is the measure of overall potential gain traditionally used on the SSG.  TR assumes a potential future price based on a future &lt;U&gt;high&lt;/U&gt; PE level.  Projected Average Return (PAR) is another measure of overall potential gain.  PAR assumes a potential future price based on a future &lt;U&gt;average&lt;/U&gt; PE level.  Both TR and PAR assume the same future high EPS level.  The amount of PE expansion assumed to be achievable is greater with TR than with PAR.

==Sensitivity of Total Return to Changes in High PE and High EPS==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

&lt;math&gt;%chgPE&lt;/math&gt; = percentage by which high PE is changed

&lt;math&gt;%chgEPS&lt;/math&gt; = percentage by which high EPS is changed

&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = time period over which Rate (i.e., TR or PAR) is calculated
  
&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt[n]{\left(1+%chgPE\right) \left(1+%chgEPS\right)} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;%chgRate = c * (1 + 1/Rate)\ &lt;/math&gt;, the resulting percentage change in Rate 

or, with &lt;math&gt;GF = 1+Rate&lt;/math&gt;, GF being the growth factor associated with Rate

&lt;math&gt;%chgRate = c \cdot GF / (GF-1)\ &lt;/math&gt;

As the need for rapid calculations increased, commercial organisations introduced the [[Wikipedia:electronic calculator|electronic calculator]] to the market. Then the [[Wikipedia:computer|computer]] appeared.

The price of computers decreased, and they started appearing in more businesses, and then also in schools, libraries, and wealthier governments.

The [[Wikipedia:Internet|Internet]] connected computers together and provided more information to users, but there were also problems such as fraudulent websites, overabundant commercial emails, copyright violations, server outages, and lack of connectivity to poorer countries.

The dawn of the computer age brought about some disadvantages, such as incompatible file formats, fears about privacy, and error messages such as the [[Wikipedia:Blue Screen of Death|Blue Screen of Death]].

===About Lithuanian language itself===

The Lithuanian language belongs to the Baltic group of Indoeuropean languages. The other language in this group is Latvian, so if you know Latvian you may find it easy to learn Lithuanian. The languages are more different from each other than, for example, different Romance languages. They are also called Balto-Slavs because they share striking similarities with the Slavs, especially Russian and Polish. Like the Slavs, they have genders, noun cases, tenses, plurals and so on. There are no articles. Prepositions are avoided in favour of case endings. E.g. &quot;namas&quot; means &quot;house&quot;, while &quot;name&quot; means &quot;in a/the house&quot;). Therefore the Lithuanian language might seem hard at first to learn for people who are used to languages with a different structure.

===About usage of Lithuanian language===

Lithuanian is the official language of the Republic of Lithuania, which has about 3.5 million people, of which 83% are ethnic Lithuanians. There are Lithuanian communities in the neighboring countries of Poland and Latvia, where some villages have Lithuanian majorities.  Larger communities of Lithuanians existed in Belarus and what is now Kaliningrad Oblast' of Russia.  There also exist traditional emigrant communities, mostly in America and Australia, of people who are descendents of interwar emigrants. There are also new emigrant communities, made up of people emigrating now, largely in Spain, the UK and Ireland. Some of the old emigration trends, e.g. USA, remained too, while others disappeared (e.g. South America).

===About dialects===

==Lithuanian writing and pronouncing==
===The Lithuanian alphabet===
Lithuanian alphabet is a modified Latin alphabet. Consists of the following 32  letters (in order):
*A – the long or the short A (see the pronouncing rules above), [a / ā].
*Ą (A nosinė) – long A, [ā].
*B – like B in bag, [b / b'].
*C – like English Ts (e.g. in Tsar), [ts / t's'].
*Č – like English Tsh (T and then sh), [t&amp;#643; / t&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#643;&lt;/sup&gt;' / t'&amp;#643;'].
*D – like D in dog, [d / d'].
*E – long or short E, (see the pronouncing rules below), [e / æ].
*Ę (E nosinė) – long E, [æ].
*Ė – is like German e and long (see the pronouncing rules below), [ē].
*F – like English F or PH (e.g. in fog), [f / f'].
*G – like G in golf, [g / g'].
*H – like H in Hungary, [h / h']
*I –  short i, like i in English big; i in a diphthong, like y in say, the palatalization mark  [i / ǐ / &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;].
*Į (I nosinė) – long i (see the pronouncing rules below), [ī]. 
*Y (I ilgoji) – second long i (see the pronouncing rules below), [ī]. 
*J – like Y in the English word young [j].
*K – like K in Kilometer, [k / k'].
*L – like L in long, [l / l'].
*M – like M in Mike, [m / m'].
*N – like N in november or N in link [n / n' / &amp;#627; /&amp;#627;'].
*O – long or (rare) short O, [ō / o].
*P – like P in Pong, [p / p'].
*R – like Spanish R, [r / r'].
*S – like S in song, [s / s'].
*Š – slightly less tight than English Sh (e.g. in Shell) [&amp;#643; / &amp;#643;'].
*T – like T in Tango, [t / t'].
*U – short u, like oo in English food, u in a diphthong, like w in cow [u / ǔ]
*Ų (U nosinė) – long U, [ū].
*Ū (U ilgoji) – long U, [ū].
*V – medial sound between English [v] and [w]; [v / v']].
*Z – like Z in Zone, [z /z'].
*Ž – voiced variant of Š, [&amp;#658; / &amp;#658;'], the sound in the middle of English &quot;Treasure&quot;.
*Ch – these letters together are pronounced as an unvoiced variant of Lithuanian h, like ch in scottish loch, [χ / χ' ]. 

The letters W, X and Q are not used in Lithuanian except in proper names (e. g. Washington'o miestas). 
The letters F, H and the digraph Ch are only used in loaned words, known in many European languages (e. g. Chemija)

===The pronouncing of consonants===
====The rules====
# Any Lithuanian consonant may be palatalized. Palatalized consonants are pronounced softly, as before [i], but not palatalized are pronounced hardly, stiffly. 
#* Consonants are palatalized when they go directly before e (ę or ė) or i (į or y). Consonants, that go directly before other vowel letters should be pronounced not palatalized. 
#*The letter i in digraphs ia (ią), io, iu (ių, iū) plays a role of the palatalization mark (see The pronouncing of vowels).
#*Consonants, that go directly before any palatalized consonant are palatalized too. It mean, that palatalization takes effect in a group of consonants, when the last consonant of the group is directly before e (ę or ė) or i (į or y). 
#* Consonants, that go directly before any not palatalized consonant are not palatalized, except the consonant [l] in few cases. 
#*Consonant [j] doesn't have a not palatalized pronouncing. 
# Voiced consonants directly before unvoiced ones become similar to unvoiced. And, in the same way, unvoiced consonants directly before voiced ones assimilate to voiced ones. 
#* Unvoiced – voiced consonant pairs are: [b] – [p], [d] – [t], [g] – [k], [h] – [χ], [z] – [s] and [&amp;#658;] - [&amp;#643;]
#* Voiced consonants [l], [m], [n], [r], [v] don't have a pair unvoiced sounds, they pronounced less voiced than in general, and unvoiced consonants don't became voiced before them. 
#* Unvoiced consonant [j] doesn't have a pair voiced sound, and assimilation of the prior sound is almost insensible before [j]. 
# Consonants [b] – [p], [d] – [t], [g] – [k], [h] – [χ] are pronounced much less aspired than their English counterparts. 
#The consonant letter n is pronounced [&amp;#627;] before k or g and [n] in other cases.

Note: This simplified transcription is only used in wikipedia. In many study sources of the Lithuanian language no transcription is used or the more sophisticated, scientific transcription is used.

===The pronunciation of vowels===
====The rules==== 
#Any vowel sound has two variants, the long and the short in Lithuanian language. 
#*Letters a, e can be read long ([ā] , [æ]) or short ([a], [e]), depending on the word and its form (case, tense, etc.). The long a or e of this kind may appear once in a word. 
#*Letters ą, ę, ė, į, y, ų, ū are always pronounced long ([ā], [æ], [ē], [ī], [ū]). 
#*Letters u, i are always pronounced short ([u], [i]) (except cases, when they are a part of diphthongs).
#*Letter o is pronounced long ([ō]) at most, but in the case of many loaned words it's pronounced short [o] in word root. 
#*Possible short variant of [ē] and more often short variant of [æ] are marked with the same [e] here. They aren't distinguished in spelling too.
#There are few cases, when a vowel letter is pronounced not like a vowel sound:
#*The letter i directly before a (ą), o, u (ų, ū) (but not e!) (in ia, ią, io, iu, ių, iū and not ie) isn't pronounced and marks the palatalization (see above). This usual rule has few exceptions in [[w: stem (linguistics) |stems]] of some loaned words, most of them are known in many other European languages (e. g. pianinas [pijan'''i'''nas] 'a piano', pionierius [pijon'''i'''er&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;us] 'a pioneer').
#*The letters i and u in ai, ei, ie, ui, uo are parts of respective diphthongs. This rule has few formal exceptions of the same kind as the previous, but in fluent Lithuanian these exceptions usually aren't seen.

===The accent=== 

# The accent in Lithuanian is free (not connected with any particular syllable or sound). Accents of the different forms of the same word also may differ. 
# The accent in Lithuanian has three forms, all of which have different pronunciation in different cases. These three forms are: the initial long syllable accent, the final long syllable accent and the short syllable accent. When we have a single vowel (not a diphthong) in an accented  syllable, the form of stress also indicates, if the vowel is long or short. 

In this wikibook the Lithuanian accent is marked by printing the respective vowel bold. This allows the initial and the final accents in syllables containing a diphthong to be distinguished, as far as is sufficient for intermediate knowledge of Lithuanian.

Note: In the vocabularies the three forms of accent are often marked with three marks - the final long syllable accent with a circumflex mark (^), the initial long syllable accent with an acute mark (´) and the short syllable stress with the grave mark (`), but the meaning of these marks differs from their usage in most other European languages (e. g. in the Greek language).

==Lithuanian grammar==
===The main things on verbs===
*Verbs have three different main tenses, that allows as to express an action in the past, in the present and in the future. The fourth tense is used to express a repeated action in the past (it's called the past iterative tense). 

:Verbs of different tenses have different endings. The stems of a verb them often are different (although not much) in different tenses.

|} 

:One may notice, that stems of the past iterative tenses don't differ from respective stems of the future tense, except the last consonant. This refers to an actual rule in Lithuanian. 


*Lithuanian verbs may have more forms, that are like tenses, but we'll leave them for the further. 
*Verbs have five persons in every tense. Every person has it's own endings, and this system is almost regular. 
*# The first singular person always ends with u, but actual its ending may be longer.  
*#* renk'''u''' 'I gather' or 'I'm gathering' (the present tense) 
*#* veiki'''u''' 'I do' or 'I act' (the present tense) 
*#*tyli'''u''' 'I keep silence' (the present tense) 
*#*mana'''u''' 'I think', 'I suppose', 'I believe' (the present tense) 
*#*lika'''u''' 'I stayed' (the past tense) 
*#*rašia'''u''' “I wrote' (the past tense)
*# The second singular person always ends with i, but actual its ending may be longer. 
*#*renk'''i''' 'you gather' or 'you're gathering' (the present tense) 
*#*veik'''i''' 'you do' or 'you act' (the present tense) 
*#*tyl'''i''' 'you  keep silence' (the present tense) 
*#*mana'''i''' 'you think', 'you suppose', 'you believe' (the present tense) 
*#*lika'''i''' 'you stayed' (the past tense) 
*#*raše'''i''' “you wrote' (the past tense) 
*#*:Note, that these endings are used for single person only, like as the old English ''thou dost'', ''thou gatherst'' etc. 
*# The third person is one both for the singular and for the plural. Its endings are -a / -ia, -i, -o or ė. 
*#*r'''e'''nka [r'''e'''n...] 'he /she gathers' or 'he /she is gathering' (the present tense) 
*#*ve'''i'''kia 'he /she does' or 'he /she acts' (the present tense)

*#*l'''i'''ko 'he /she stayed' (the past tense) 
*#*r'''a'''šė [r'''ā'''...] 'he /she wrote' (the past tense) 
*#The first plural person has endings, regularly made from endings of the third person. One simply should add -me after the ending of the third person (possible variants are -ame /-iame, -ime, -ome, -ėme). 
*#*r'''e'''nkame [r'''e'''n...] 'we gather' or 'we are gathering' (the present tense)

*#*r'''a'''šėme [r'''ā'''...] 'we wrote' (the past tense) 
*#The second plural person has endings, regularly made from endings of the third person. One simply should add -te after the ending of the third person (possible variants are -ate / -iate, -ite, -ote, ėte). 
*#*r'''e'''nkate [r'''e'''n...] 'you gather' or 'you are gathering' (the present tense) 
*#*ve'''i'''kiate 'you do' or 'you act' (the present tense)

**There are also few other suffixes, used in the present or in the past tense, that have their own regular endings for every person. 

====The personal pronouns====

Verbs may be used in a sentence without personal pronouns, but personal pronouns are useful, especially for the 3rd person. 

{|
!
!'''singular'''
!
!'''plural'''
|-
||1st person 
|| aš [a&amp;#643;] 'I'
|| 
|| mes [mæs] 'we' 
|-
||2nd person 
|| tu 'you' &lt;br&gt; (singular!)
||
|| jūs 'you' 
|-
||2rd person 
|| ji 'she', jis 'he' 
||
|| jos 'they (feminine)', &lt;br&gt; jie 'they' 
|}

Note: 
*Here are forms of the [[w:nominative case|nominative]] only in the table. You should use forms of other cases to speak about something or somebody as a direct object or as an indirect object.  
*It's polite to use the 2nd plural person instead of the second singular in the official style  . Remember, that you should speak in this case as if you deal with many people,  not simply changing ''Tu'' to ''Jūs'' only. For example: not &lt;strike&gt;''tu eini'' → ''jūs eini''&lt;/strike&gt;, but ''tu eini'' → ''jūs einate''. 

====The simplest sentences====

*The simplest sentence consists of a single verb. But everybody feels that such a sentence is too unclear. We'll skip this point here. 

*The next step is a sentence with a subject and a verb. The subject should be put in the [[w:nominative case|nominative]] [[w:case (linguistics)|case]]. Word order is either S-V or the V-S. The S-V is more common, although native English speakers shouldn't forget, that the second possibility sometimes may be used too.
*: &lt;br&gt;
*:'''Examples (the S-V – the V-S):''' 
**merg'''a'''itė v'''a'''lgo [v'''ā'''lgō] 'a girl eats' 
**:v'''a'''lgo [v'''ā'''lgō] merg'''a'''itė  '' 'a girl'' eats' 
**berni'''u'''kas pi'''e'''šė 'a boy drew' 
**:pi'''e'''šė berni'''u'''kas '' 'a boy'' drew' 
**mes [mæs] l'''i'''ksime 'we'll stay' 
**:l'''i'''ksime mes [mæs] '' 'we'' 'll stay' 
**kas [kas] n'''o'''ri [n'''ō'''ri]? 'who wants?' 
**:(the V-S isn't used)
**liet'''u'''s l'''y'''ja 'it rains', literally 'a rain rains' (less common than with the V-S)
**:l'''y'''ja liet'''u'''s 'it rains', literally 'a rain rains' (the main variant in such case)

: &lt;br&gt;
*Going further, we could add the object to a sentence. The object may be added anywhere in a sentence in Lithuanian. When one changes the place of the object, intonation of the sentence and some fine nuances (which we'll skip here) of its meaning change too. 
*The object may be in one of few cases, and it depends on what kind of the object we have. 
*: &lt;br&gt;
*:'''Examples:'''
**merg'''a'''itė valgo [vāl...] '''o'''buolį 'a girl eats an apple' (the object is in  the  [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**berni'''u'''kas piešė k'''a'''tiną [k'''ā'''t...]  'a boy drew a cat' (the object is in the [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**kas [kas] n'''o'''ri p'''i'''eno? 'who wants some milk?' (the object is in  the [[w:genitive case|genitive]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**jis n'''o'''ri arb'''a'''tos [...b'''ā'''t...] 'he wants some tea' (the object is in  the [[w:genitive case|genitive]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**:j'''i'''s arbatą [...b'''ā'''t...] g'''e'''rs [g'''e'''rs]  'he will drink a tea' (the object is in  the  [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**j'''i''' neužm'''i'''ršta draugės 'she don't forget the friend' (the object is in the [[w:genitive case|genitive]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**: ji par'''a'''šė [...r'''ā'''...] draugei l'''a'''išką 'she have wrote a letter for a friend' (the direct object is in the [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]], the indirect one is in the [[w:dative case|dative]] [[w:case |case]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is how to burn &quot;ham sandwich&quot; such as DreamSNES, NesterDC, SMEG, MAMED, MAMEDC, and NeoPoccot. (Those are the emulators that I burned using this method, but I am pretty sure that it works with every self-bootable emulator for the Dreamcast.) Making a ROM disc is covered in the second section.

==Emulators==
Burning a self-bootable emulator for the Dreamcast isn't difficult. These are the tools you need:
*[http://www.dchomebrew.org/mactools.shtml Mac Pack 4.0]
*Roxio Toast 5, 6, or 7
**In Toast 7, make sure you have &quot;Show Legacy Formats&quot; turned on in the preferences.
*A program that can save SimpleText documents, such as [http://www.jedit.org/ jEdit].

First, you will need to download a DiscJuggler image—a &lt;tt&gt;.cdi&lt;/tt&gt; file—of the emulator. Most, if not all, websites have zipped the emulator, and the archive will have to be unzipped by a program such as MacRAR or StuffIt Expander. Once the file is unzipped, open '''CDIRip 0.5''' in the Mac Pack Applications folder and select the &lt;tt&gt;.cdi&lt;/tt&gt; file. Select a file in the directory that you want to save in, and wait until the CDIRip process says &quot;All done, good burning! Click to exit.&quot; After this process, you'll have two new files: an audio file and a data file. You will now have to copy the '''Isofix Config File''', which can also be found in the Mac Pack Applications folder. Drag it to where the emulator's files are.


Open the file named '''CDIRip CDI Analysis''' with a text editor. (The file was created when the CDIRip process was completed.) Copy the number following &quot;LBA:&quot; of the second session. (It's usually a five-digit number.) Now open the '''Isofix Config File''' with a text editor. (It was the file you copied earlier.) Its text should be exactly what follows*:

:&lt;tt&gt;isofix&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;''xxxxx''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;mac&lt;/tt&gt;

Replace whatever number is on the second line (where the ''x'''s are in the example) and paste the LBA number that you copied from the CDIRip CDI Analysis file.

Open '''Isofix 1.3'''—which is also located in the Mac Pack Applications folder—and it will ask you for the ISO to work with. That would be the data (generally the second) session created by CDIRip 0.5. (In my test, it was called ''Session 2 Track 02 Data'', but that may not be the case for everyone.) It will then ask you for the ISO Config file. Open the now-edited config file and wait for the process to end. (It may take some time, so don't think that your computer has frozen.) Now, when it is done you should notice three new files: &lt;tt&gt;bootfile.bin&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;fixed.iso&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;header.iso&lt;/tt&gt;. Trash &lt;tt&gt;bootfile.bin&lt;/tt&gt;: you don't need it.

Open Toast and select ''Disc Image'' from the ''Other'' menu in Toast 5, or on the left under the ''Copy'' tab in Toast 6 and 7. Drag your &lt;tt&gt;fixed.iso&lt;/tt&gt; file into Toast and burn it as ''Write Session''. (In Toast 6 and 7, these options are located under the ''Advanced'' tab on the screen where you can select the burn speed.) When it is done, close Toast and open it up again. This time, select ''Multitrack CD-ROM XA'' and drag &lt;tt&gt;header.iso&lt;/tt&gt; into Toast. Burn it as ''Write Disc''.

Insert the disc into your Dreamcast, power it on, and your emulator should load.

==ROMs==
You'll need toast.

THIS IS HOW I DID IT, FIRST YOU'LL NEED TOAST (I USE 5.0) BUT OTHER VERSIONS WILL WORK. DOWNLOAD ALL THE ROMS YOU WANT AND THEN UNZIP THEM ALL. THEN OPEN UP TOAST. HOLD DOWN OTHER AND SET IT TO ISO 9660. DRAG ALL OF YOUR ROMS TO THIS AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THESE SETTINGS. CD-ROM, ISO9660 LEVEL 1, APPEND VERSION NUMBERS CHECKED AND USE APPLE EXTENSIONS UNCHECKED, NOW CLICK DONE AND DRAG ALL OF YOUR ROMS TO TOAST AND BURN IT AS WRITE DISC.

To burn any nonself bootable emu on dcemu.com

You'll need Toast

First download the plain files then extract them. Make a roms folder and throw all of your roms in that folder. Now open toast and select ISO 9660. Make sure you follow these exact settings...

CD-rom

ISO 9660 Level 1

Append Version Numbers checked rechecked and checked again

Use Apple Extensions unchecked

Now burn it as write disc. and as non-write disc

Insert the bootdisc then the switch the disc with the emu.

    <title>Quantum Mechanics/Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Quantum Mechanics/Page}}

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of uncertainties in related physical quantities (e.g. position and momentum, energy and time, etc.) has a finite lower bound. This arises from the fact that the momentum and position operators do not commute. A common misunderstanding is that in simple terms this means that a measurement for position disturbs the momentum of a particle, and a measurement for the momentum of a particle dirsurbs its position. All of this information is false.

In other words, if you know the position of a particle and you measure the momentum, it disturbs the position - thus you are less certain of its position.  This is incorrect.

In actuality, the uncertainty arises from fundamental underlying physical laws governing physical systems which can be measured.  Particles have a fundamental dual nature and may be considered either a point source or a probability distribution of position depending upon what one is trying to accomplish by interacting with the particle.

Repeated measurements of particles in known/delivered states will give a distribution range governed by a probability function for either of the two conjugate properties, position (x) or momentum (p).  The Uncertainty Principle gives a mathematically provable lower bound of the product of the uncertainty (error or deviation from a precise center of the probability wave law) in the measured conjugate properties.  

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x\Delta p \ge\frac{\hbar}{2}=\frac{\frac{h}{2\pi}}{2}\, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 3.14 &lt;/math&gt; and h is Planck's constant with &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; being Planck's reduced constant.

Thus the precision with which one can know one property is related mathematically to what is known of the conjugate property.  If position is known with great precision for a specific particle or wave then the conjugate momentum is &lt;b&gt;not known&lt;/b&gt; with a precision greater than that allowed by the lower bound provided by the Uncertainty Principle equation shown above.

Here is the derivation for the general uncertainty principle for two operators, A and B, that do not commute.

Let iC be the commutator of A and B:

[A,B] = iC

Furthermore, A and B are Hermitian operators.  Recall the definition of the uncertainties:

&lt;math&gt;\left(\Delta A\right)^{2} = \langle\left(A- \langle A\rangle\right)^{2}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\Delta B\right)^{2} = \langle\left(B- \langle B\rangle\right)^{2}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

To do:

Find a mathematically simple derivation of uncertainty principle and provide it here.

Find an intuitive example and provide here.

Provide a variety of equivalent derivations using different techniques to allow understanding by widest possible audience.

&quot;Linux is something for Windows haters, BSD is something for Unix lovers&quot; - Heike S., February 1998

&quot;Linux people do what they do because they hate Microsoft. We do what we do because we love Unix.&quot; - Theo de Raadt, founder of [[w:OpenBSD|OpenBSD]], [http://www.forbes.com/intelligentinfrastructure/2005/06/16/linux-bsd-unix-cz_dl_0616theo.html quoted in &quot;Is Linux For Losers?&quot; at Forbes.com]

&quot;I view Linux as something that's not Microsoft-a backlash against
Microsoft, no more and no less.&quot; - Ken Thompson, 1999

:''Here are more slogans taken from [[Transwiki:Useful unix command]].''

Linux: the choice of a GNU generation.

Windows: where do you want to go today? Linux: where do you want to go tomorrow?

'''Bouillabaisse''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] [[Cookbook:Stew|stew]] originating from the port city of [[w:Marseille|Marseille]].

This dish is made by boiling several [[w:species|species]] of fish with herbs and vegetables. The [[cookbook:broth|broth]] is then served as a soup poured over bread seasoned with [[w:rouille|''rouille'']] (a spicy French [[w:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]) with the fish and vegetables served separately. The exact proportions of these ingredients vary by cook and region.

The ''Charte de la Bouillabaisse Marseillaise'' (the Charter of Marseillaise Bouillabaisse )&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toquentete.net/deran_charte_de_la_bouillabaisse.php Charte de la Bouillabaisse Marseillaise]&lt;/ref&gt; was signed in 1980 by 11 restaurants in France in an attempt to standardize the definition of  a bouillabaisse. According to the charter, bouillabaisse must be prepared with at least four of the following fish: [[w:Monkfish|monkfish]], [[w:John Dory|John Dory]], [[w:Galinette|galinette]] (or [[w:Gunard|gunard]]), [[w:Mullett|mullett]], [[w:Scorpion fish|rascasse]], [[w:Conger eel|conger eel]], and [[w:chapon|chapon]] ([[w:Rascasse rouge|rascasse rouge]], or red scorpion fish).  Most versions will contain at least rascasse to be considered authentic.

==Traditional bouillabaisse==
This recipe comes from one of the most traditional Marseille restaurants, ''Grand Bar des Goudes'' on ''Rue Désirée-Pelleprat''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis André, ''Cuisines des pays de France'', Éditions du Chêne, 2001 &lt;/ref&gt;

===For the broth===
* 660 grams [[w:sea robin|sea robin]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:scorpionfish|scorpionfish]], sliced
* 660 grams red [[w:Gurnard|gurnard]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:conger|conger]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:lotte|lotte]], or [[w:monkfish|monkfish]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:John Dory|John Dory]], sliced
* 1 live [[w:octopus|octopus]] (optional)&lt;ref&gt; Octopus is used in bouillabaisse only in the Goudes quarter of Marseille, according to Jean Louis André, ''Cuisines des Pays de France'' &lt;/ref&gt;, cut into pieces
*10 [[w:sea urchins|sea urchins]]
*1 kilogram of [[w:potato|potato]]
*7 cloves of [[w:garlic|garlic]]
*3 [[w:onions|onions]], sliced
*5 ripe [[w:tomato|tomatoes]], peeled, quartered and without seeds
*1 cup of [[w:olive oil|olive oil]]
*1 [[w:bouquet garni|bouquet garni]]
*1 branch of [[w:fennel|fennel]]
*8 threads of [[w:saffron|saffron]]
*10 slices of [[w:pain de campagne|country bread]]
*salt and [[w:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
''Note: Finding the species of fish listed above may be difficult. If so, substitute any combination of four of five species with firm, white flesh''

===For the ''rouille''===
*1 egg yolk
*2 cloves of garlic
*1 cup of olive oil
*10 threads of saffron
*salt and cayenne pepper
''Note: Serve this dish without rouille to reduce the fat and cholesterol in this dish.''

===Preparation===
#Scale the fish and wash them, if possible, in sea water. Cut them into large slices, leaving the bones. Wash the octopus and cut into pieces. 
#Warm the olive oil in a large, deep [[w:saucepan|saucepan]].
#Add the onions, along with six cloves of crushed garlic, the octopus pieces and tomatoes. Brown at low heat turning gently for five minutes.
#Add the fish slices; first the large slices then the smaller ones. Cover with boiling water and add salt, pepper, fennel, the  ''bouquet garni'' and saffron. Boil at a low heat, stirring from time to time so the fish doesn't stick to the pan. Correct the seasoning. Remove the bouillabaise from the heat once the oil and water have thoroughly blended with the other ingredients. This should take about twenty minutes.
#Prepare the ''rouille'':  Use a mortar to crush the garlic cloves into a fine paste after removing the stems. Add the egg yolk and the saffron, then blend in the olive oil little by little to make a mayonnaise, stirring it with the pounder of the mortar. 
#Cook the potatoes, peeled and boiled and cut into large slices, in salted water for 15 to 20 minutes. Open the sea urchins with a pair of scissors and remove the [[w:sea urchin#as food|roe]] with a small spoon. 
#Arrange the fish on a platter. Add the sea urchin roe into the broth and stir. 
#Rub several slices of bread with garlic and spread a tablespoon of ''rouille'' on each. Place at least two slices per serving bowl.
#Remove the fish and potatoes from the broth and place them on a large serving platter.
#Pour the hot broth in each bowl containing a slice of bread smothered in ''rouille''. Then serve the fish and the potatoes on a separate platter.

{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Seafood|Seafood]]

A '''herring''' is a type of small oily fish found in the temperate, shallow waters of the North Atlantic.  A smaller variant lives in the Baltic Sea.

Herring can be cooked in the usual ways for small fish - [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]], [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] or [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]].

Herrings can also be [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] and served in a sour cream sauce.

A '''kipper''' is a split and smoked herring, and a '''bloater''' is a whole smoked herring. Both are staples of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British cuisine]].

A typical Dutch delicacy is raw herring (actually enzyme-cured) with raw shredded [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]. To stop parasites, the herring has to be deep-frozen before the curing process.

In Sweden, Baltic herring is fermented to make '''surströmming'''. Herring soup is also a traditional [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]].

In Germany, North Sea herring is pickled to make '''Matjes''', or soused herring.

A '''rollmop''' is a cured herring fillet, rolled up and preserved in vinegar which is flavoured with onions and spices.

'''Pine nuts''' are the edible seeds of pine trees. Commercially, most pine nuts are harvested from the Korean Pine; other important species include the Stone Pine in the Mediterranean area, the Colorado Pinyon and the Single-leaf Pinyon in southwestern North America. Several other species are of lesser importance. They are high in protein, and are also a source of dietary fibre. Pine nuts are considered by many to be an essential component of [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]], and are frequently added to meat, fish, and vegetable dishes. They are also used in chocolates and desserts such as baklava.

Try to go back to the origins of the names for as many common hacking terms; things like hacking, cracking, phreaking, l33t speak and the like.

'''Hackers versus Crackers'''

The quick run-down:

:# most hackers have university level training in computer sciences while crackers are largely untrained in any formal environment - predominately self-taught or peer reviewed.
:# crackers are viewed as pests by hackers while hackers are ignored or mocked by crackers
:# hackers build things while crackers break things (as in security)
:# Phreakers (a.k.a. phreaks), Phreaking - Phone intercepts, phone cracking, gaining control over phone networks.

'''Script Kitties'''

Script Kids, 'kiddies', or &quot;kitties&quot;, use premade scripts in order to do as much damage as possible, these scripts are typically made by crackers so as to expand the amount of damage they do, without having to go to the work of actually cracking machines themselves.  

Data Mining, (Ro)Bots:  Some scripts -'Bots', replicate themselves, seek out specific information or data, copy it, and forward that information to a captive storage space on computers that have been previously taken over by the script kiddies ('owned', or 'Bot'ed', systems).  

Sometimes involved in DataMining (a database search for keywords, email addresses),  the 'bots' can reside in the &quot;background' in a compromised computer, logging keystrokes, or collecting data, and forwarding it, until that computer is thoroughly cleaned of the bots by a knowledgeable technician.

&lt;br&gt;
==What is the SAT?==
'''The SAT Reasoning Test''', formerly the SAT I: Reasoning Test, is a college entrance examination administered several times a year by the non-profit College Board.  The exam is used by many colleges and universities in the United States, among other factors, to determine acceptance into undergraduate school.  The SAT is not the only test you can take for college admission, but it is the most widely used.  The other most common test is the ACT.  Interestingly, SAT does not stand for anything (neither does ACT).  If you plan to attend college after graduating from high school, the SAT is one of the most important tests you will ever take.  You should be sure to take it seriously and study hard, using books such as this one.

The SAT is a timed test of approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes, divided into three sections: the '''Math section''', the '''Critical Reading section''', and the '''Writing section''', which includes a written essay.  Each section is graded on a scale of 200-800.  Scaling allows the College Board to correct minor variations in difficulty between versions of the tests.  On the test itself, there are ten sets of questions: three from each section.  Each section has a different time limit; each question has five answers.  One of the Writing section sets is the essay, which is also always Section 1.  One of the sections is known as an equating section and does not count in anyway towards your score; it is used to test new questions and compare the difficulty of different exams.

Until recently, the SAT had only two sections.  The Writing section was added in 2005 and the other two sections were overhauled.  As a result, you now have to use concepts from Algebra 2 in the Math section, but analogies have been removed from Critical Reading.  Collectively, the new test is referred to as the New  SAT.  The maximum possible score on the new test is 2400.  According to the College Board, only 107 students out of 330,000 scored a perfect score on the date of its first administration on March 12, 2005.

==How is the SAT scored?==
The '''SAT is scored''' in a different manner than most tests you are probably used to.  On the SAT, a grading theory is used where the student begins with a raw score of zero.  You earn 1 point for each correct answer, lose 1/4 of a point for each wrong answer, and receive no credit (but also lose no points) for leaving a question blank.  However, note also that there are 10 questions in the math section which require you to provide your own numerical answer; fortunately, no points are deducted for wrong answers on these questions.   The raw score is then converted using a chart developed by the College Board into a scaled score.  Note that although scores under 200 are possible, the College Board cancels all scores which fall into this category.

For the essay, a special method of scoring is used.  The essay is scanned into a computer and transmitted over the internet to approved graders.  Two graders read your essay and give you a score of 0-6.  A zero score is only awarded if your answer is completely off topic.  If the two scores are more than one point apart, a third grader plays tie-breaker.  The two scores are added together (or the third grader's score is doubled) to produce a score in the range of 0-12.  This score is then used in conjunction with your writing multiple-choice raw score to produce the scaled score.

The reason for this method of grading is that the College Board's exam writers understand you are not likely to be able to answer every question on the test.  They also know that guessing on these tests would ruin the accuracy of the scores.  The loss of points for wrong answers is known as the '''guessing penalty'''.

==How do I take the SAT?==
You can '''register for the SAT''' in one of two ways, either via the [http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about.html College Board's website] or by obtaining a mail-in registration form from your high school's counseling center. 

Detailed instructions for registering and other related information are available from either location. Make sure to save a copy of your Admission Ticket and to bring it with you to the testing center, along with a Photo ID. It is recommended that you register online, as this will automatically tie your registration to an online account. About 4 weeks after you take the test, your score will then become available online, and you will be able to easily view it.

There are several options available: You can choose to order the Question and Answer Service, which provides you with your answer to each question, the correct answer, and the question itself, as well as why each answer is the correct one. You may also order the College Board's [http://store.collegeboard.com/productdetail.do?Itemkey=040901252 SAT Online Course]. Other official study guides are available, and their purchase is up to you.

==How do I get my scores?==
'''Scores first become available''' online about 2 weeks after the date on which you took the test.  After about 3 weeks, you will receive a Score Report in the mail, detailing your performance.  If you registered online, you will simply need to log in to your [http://www.collegeboard.com College Board website] account and click View my Scores in the My Organizer pane.  If not, you will need to set up an account.  You will need the SAT registration identification number found on your Admission Ticket, and all other related information.

'''Hermits''' are chewy [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]] [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]]. This version is on the strong side of the spectrum so those who prefer less hot-tasting food should hold back on the cloves and ginger.

==Ingredients==

*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (AP)
*⅔ cup seedless [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (a handful more if you like them)
*⅔ cup dark [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], packed
*2½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*½ cup molasses 
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
*2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==

#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|375°F/190°C]].
#Line a sheet pan with parchment paper (a buttered sheet pan works as well but makes cooling and cutting more difficult and more damaging to the sheet pan).
#In a large bowl, stir together flour, raisins, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt until well combined; watch the brown sugar to ensure that it doesn't clump, it will want to do so and brown sugar clumps coated in flour look a lot like raisins coated in flour.
#Stir in molasses, butter, vanilla, and egg until fully integrated. Spread the dough in two strips (approximately 6&quot; by 3&quot;) separated by at least 1½&quot; on the sheet pan.
#Bake for 12 – 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the strips comes out dry.
#Allow to cool slightly then remove the hermits (on their parchment) to cooling racks to cool completely; be sure the bottoms have cooled (just reach under and feel -- if its more than a little warmer than room temperature its not there yet). 
#Move the hermits (still on their parchment) to a counter for portioning and removal from parchment. Cut hermits into 1½ [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] wide strips (a [[Cookbook:Pizza Cutter|pizza cutter]] should work well) then carefully scrape them away from the parchment with a good thin [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]].
#Enjoy with a glass of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:A Nice Cup of Tea|a nice cup of tea]].

Although nice warm these hermits will be even better after a night in an air-tight tin. They should last about a week in that tin though at my house they've never lasted more than a day.

'''Wonton wrappers''' are thin [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]-like wrappers used for wontons. They are suitable for [[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|wonton soup]]. Oversize (7&quot;&amp;nbsp;square) (45cm&amp;nbsp;square) wrappers may be used as [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] wrappers. Round wrappers are best for making [[Cookbook:Potsticker|potstickers]].

Most people will prefer to buy wrappers ready-made. This is especially easy for wontons, because egg roll wrappers may be cut in quarters to make wonton wrappers. Look in a supermarket near the [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] and Asian [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]].

For the stubbornly determined expert cook though, here you go:

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/3-1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] water

==Procedure==
#Sift flour and salt into a large bowl; create a well-like indentation in the center.
#Beat egg lightly, pour into indentation in the flour and mix well.
#Sprinkle with cold water, wet your hands and knead the mixture into a smooth dough.
#Place dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth, refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.
#Sprinkle a wide work area or board with flour. Roll out the dough until it is paper thin and its edges are even in thickness. The wonton skins will be partially transparent.
#Cut dough in 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.5 cm) strips, flour lightly then stack one on top of the other and cut the strips into 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.5 cm) squares.
#Place skins on tray and cover with a damp cloth until ready to use.

==Recipes using wonton wrappers include==
*[[Cookbook:Potsticker|Potsticker (Gyoza)]] (circles are best; hexagons may make sense)
*[[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|Wonton Soup]]
*[[Cookbook:Egg Roll|Egg Roll]] (make 7&quot; (18cm) squares)

==Introduction to the Math section==
The Math section of the SAT covers several areas: first, it covers general concepts concerning numbers which you are expected to know. Second, it encompasses geometry, especially the properties of angles. Often, parts of the first two are used in coordination with the third area, Algebra. Also, some concepts from Algebra 2, particularly second degree equations, are tested as well.

The Math section contains, in general, around 50 questions. Each question has five answers. However, the Math section is different in that ten of these questions do not have multiple-choice answers. You are required to grid in your answers on these questions. Don't worry- they are similar to the other types of questions; make sure and study the probability portions of Chapter 1. Several different types of answers are allowed on this section.

Although the New SAT contains more straightforward math questions, you must still become used to solving unusual problems involving logic. This logic will build on general rules you can learn in the chapters listed above. The reason is linked to the College Board's philosophy about the test; they see it as more of an aptitude test than an assessment test. In the end, no one can teach you the logic behind the test, but you can study hard, and that will improve your score a lot.

==What is the guessing penalty?==
The '''guessing penalty''', as explained in the Introduction, is the subtraction of 1/4 of a point for each question which you answer incorrectly.  However, the term guessing penalty is misleading.  Consider the following situation: assume that Fred takes the SAT and randomly guesses on five questions.  Because each question has five answers (excluding the ten student response math questions), probability says that he has a 1 in 5 chance of getting each question right.  This means that in the 5 questions, he is likely to get one correct and 4 incorrect.  He will receive 1 point for each correct answer and lose 1/4 points for each incorrect answer.  Quick SAT study question: What will his raw score be?  The answer is zero.  This means that there really ''is no guessing penalty''.  Unless you are very unlucky (or lucky), your net score is unlikely to change noticeably if you guess randomly.

The point of all of this is that guessing is not necessarily harmful to you.  Below, you will learn exactly when to guess.  For now, understand that though the SAT may be graded differently than the way in which you are used to having your tests graded, it does not mean that it is a harder system.  Learn to accept it now and look on the SAT as a challenge, not a necessary evil.

==When should I guess?==
Contrary to popular belief, the idea that you should never guess, is, like the guessing penalty, completely false. '''There is a time to guess''' on the SAT.  On some questions you will not have any idea what the answer is; you are likely on these questions to even be confused as to what it is asking. You should never guess on such a question. You are much more likely to get it wrong in this situation.

However, should you be able to eliminate answers, especially in the Writing and Critical Reading sections, it may be in your best interest to guess.  Before guessing, ask your self a few questions:
#'''What are the chances of getting this question correct?'''  If you can eliminate one or more answers, it is probably a good idea to guess.
#'''How sure am I of the answer?'''  If you cannot make an educated decision about your guess, even if you can eliminate one or more answers, it may be unwise to answer the question. Guessing in the blind is never a good idea.
#'''How hard is the question?'''  Remember, the SAT (with the exception of passage-based reading) is a powered test.  Balance what you know is the probable difficulty level of a question with how sure you are of your guess.

A basic rule of thumb is if you have eliminated at least two answers and are reasonably sure of your guess, then choose an answer and move on. There's no point in worrying about it. Make your best possible choice, take a breath, and get ready for a whole new battle (that is, question).

'''Elimination'''
When it's necessary to eliminate, there are two strategies: You could eliminate answers that are bias. Remember, the test makers are most likely write the test in a neutral way; You could eliminate off-the-wall options. For example, when the problem is asked for the area of a square, there's no way any signs of a pi could appear. Usually, it happens to be the numbers that have big difference with other numbers.

==The Importance of Time==
As in life, the second biggest enemy on the SATs is the clock; the first biggest is yourself. The test requires you to answer a certain amount of questions in a certain amount of time, and thus it is vastly advantageous for you to use your time wisely. Some of these tips are fairly obvious, but it is surprising how many people neglect to do these under the pressure of the moment.
#'''Familiarize yourself with the directions ahead of time.''' You can easily waste more time figuring out how to answer questions than actually answering them. Before you take the test, make sure you know the types of questions you'll face, especially since the information is readily available before you even set foot in the test room.
#'''DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ONE QUESTION!''' That is - DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ONE QUESTION! This has been the downfall of even the cleverest, smartest people. For every challenging, thought-provoking question there are four or five easy, quickly-answered questions following it. The SATs aren't about impressing anyone--they're all about getting points. Get as many as you can.
#'''Budget your time, especially in the first few minutes.''' The more questions you answer in the beginning, the more time you have to chew over more complex problems in the end.
A good strategy (especially on the Math sections, which are much quicker to digest) is to blow through the exam, burning through the easy questions and immediately skipping any question that'll make you think too hard. Then, just keep going through the questions in the next passes. This way, you'll be less likely to dwell on hard problems and you'll at least be guaranteed the easy ones.

==What should I remember on exam day?==
Above all, remember to bring the following list of items:
#'''Your Admission Ticket'''
#'''Valid photo ID'''
#'''Two or more No. 2 sharpened pencils'''
#'''A calculator''', ''preferably a graphing one'' (although you should make sure it is approved for use on the SAT, some graphing calculators (especially ones with a QWERTY keyboard) are not allowed)
#'''A pencil sharpener'''
#'''A snack''' (to be consumed during breaks, not during test time)

Barring these, a good testing day begins long before it actually arrives. Studying, using guides such as this one, is an essential step. Being prepared will boost your self-confidence and improve your score. Start a week before the test and get a lot of sleep. You'll find you do much better. On testing day, after that good night's sleep, make sure you eat a reasonably-sized breakfast. These tips will help give you an edge; remember what one of the first people who took the New SAT said: &quot;It was a test of mental and physical endurance&quot;. At 3 hours and 45 minutes (officially), you will find your brain clogged down. Better to delay the clogging by following these steps than wishing you had when it happens.


Good luck!

The '''Collaboration of the Month''' is an attempt to get Wikibooks regulars and guests who want to help out to work together on a single project over the period of the month.  The hope is that the Wikibook will advance quickly over that period.

== Selection criteria ==

Collaborations of the Month are selected by a simple majority vote from books nominated by ''registered Wikibooks editors''.  To become a Collaboration of the Month, a Wikibook must meet the following criteria:

#The Wikibook '''must have its basic project structure already in place'''.  Preferably, it should also have a small, limited, amount of content already available.
#The Wikibook '''must concern a well-known subject'''.  For instance, a Collaboration of the Month could not be over Liquid Crystal Display Dynamics.
#The Wikibook '''must not have been a Collaboration of the Month at any time in the past year'''.

If you believe a Wikibook meets the above criteria and want to nominate it as a Collaboration of the Month, do the following:
#Add {{tl|CoMcandidate}} (see [[Wikibooks:Templates]]) to the top of the discussion page for the main page of the project.
#Click on the link within the template's box which reads '''its nomination sub-section'''.  Then, under the Nominations section on the voting page for the next month type &lt;nowiki&gt;===[[Articlename]]===&lt;/nowiki&gt; and add your reason for nomination below.  Be sure to sign your reason with your signature by adding four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Voting rules ==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

== Proposed rename ==

The pages in this book should be renamed so that they begin with &quot;General Biology/&quot; so that they are consistent with the usual wikibooks style. This would also have benefits for easier navigation and it will be impossible to &quot;lose&quot; a module (as you'd be able to find all modules easily by searching for pages beginning with &quot;General Biology/&quot;. Any move would be done in such a way as to preserve all links. I trust this will prove to be non-controversial, but note it here before proceeding to allow for any comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:58, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Vandalism ==

The image for &quot;How to build a computer&quot; seems to have been vandalised, though when clicking on it the large image is legit - any clues on what is causing this?

== Needs some rework ==

Hi Naryathegreat! I welcome your initiative for focussing collaborative work on wikibooks. This will add a new aspect to the existing projects [[Book of the month]] (which singles out an excellent presentable wikibook on the Main Page) and [[Wikibooks:Top active]] (which shows at a glance on which books wikibookians are actually mostly working). If you want to jump into the crowd and have some fun, choose one of the top ten active wikibooks by contributors. Your project &quot;Collaboration of the month&quot; then aims at bringing a currently not so active wikibook to the attention of writers (hopefully pushing it into the top-10 list for the following month).

Looking at [[Wikibooks:Top active/Listing March 2005 users]], there are at least 35 books on which more people have been working on than on [[General Biology]]. Almost half of those books are related to computers (3D software, programming, user guides), then physics/mathematics, and languages (Japanese, German, Spanish, French), and of course the attractors Cook- and Jokebook. Within those 35 books I don't see any book related at all to Biology. With the same number of contributors (2 logged in users, 6 anonymous users) I see [[Basic Ecology]], [[Organic Chemistry]], and [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] which might be the people possibly interested in working on &quot;General Biology&quot;. So, just looking at this list, one is tempted to say that the user base for the project might be limited.

So there is not much hope to focus content contributors to a book. What could be focussed though is the work on style and presentation of a book. [[General Biology]] is one of the few old books that still uses the bracket &quot;()&quot; delimiters which are clearly outdated and should be replaced by namespace &quot;:&quot; or subpage &quot;/&quot;. Which of those? This question is still [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme|open to discussion]].

Now some technical comments on your implementation:
* I think the procedure to nominate a book is overly complicated and even implemented wrongly: The template [[Template:CoMcandidate]] contains &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}_{{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and will thus point every month to a different position. Should people on the talk page re-enter their reasoning every month again?
* Where should I sign my vote? In the template or directly on the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] page? In case I have to sign in the template, what is the easy way to get there? Why do I have to write &quot;Support&quot;, if &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;# ~~~~&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; could be enough?
* Why am I limited to vote for only 1 candidate at a time? How long is this limit valid - until the book I voted for gets finally voted?
* How long are candidates supposed to stay on the page? Until they are voted? Or is there a mechanism to have books &quot;drop out&quot; of the nomination mechanism again?

I would suggest to get rid of the intermediate template, and ask people to insert their nominations directly on the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] page. (entries for nominated books can then be moved to an archive page).

I also would suggest that if you want to have a serious vote (where people have some choice), you should nominate at least 2 or 3 more books by yourself, to give an impression what kind of books this is thought for.

I also added [[Help:Development stages]] to your list of resources, since assigning them first (before actually editing the book) makes easily visible which chapters are comprehensive and which still deserve work. This focusses both, readers' and writers' attention, to their respective chapters of interest.

Having brought up a lot of critics, let me point out that I indeed welcome this initiative and hope I can contribute in improving this service by constructive criticism. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:06, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Follow-up: Nice changes, Narya! I still think the nomination rules are slightly restrictive. I am sure you have in mind that only those people sign who really intend to contribute in the end, but a few points to think about:
# Put the rules into a template - they will appear on each monthly voting page.
# &quot;You may not vote for an article you nominate.&quot; I think this rule is unnecessary. If everybody votes for the book they nominate, each book will have 1 vote more, so the result will not change. Furthermore, the first vote sets an example how and where to vote. (This I miss so far, I would not know where to put my vote: Under the title, or under the comment?)
# &quot;we ask that you vote only once under a single nomination&quot;: I like the idea of being able to vote for several books. On [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] really few people vote for more than a book, even if it is allowed there, but what if I could really think of working on two books? Or if I want to give my second vote just to ensure that another book that will not win can at least be nominated for the next month?
# Renomination with 4 or more votes: Looking at [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] this is a unrealistically high number! :-) Even if one is allowed to vote for its own book there, books barely reach the 3 vote limit on &quot;Book of the month&quot; - and the vote there is without any commitment for everybody, and everybody is allowed to vote for as many books as they like.
: To attract people I would set up as few rules as necessary at the beginning and try to attract as many voters by simple, easy rules. Once the voters are there and like &quot;Collaboration of the month&quot; you can still start to increase the number, or choose a different system (e.g. &quot;apart from the winner, the three books with most votes will be nominated for the next month&quot;..). But the 3 voter [including nominator!] rule on Wikibooks turned out to be more than sufficient (at least for now). Don't compare with Wikipedia participation (yet).. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:27, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== My support ==

This sounds like a great idea, and I will be happy if we can organize people to get behind one book at a time. Working on these books is a lot more fun and satisfying when done by a team. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 06:40, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Additional requirements needed ==

Here for August 2005, we have a nomination for COTM (1911 wikipedia) that is also at [[WB:VFD]].  Perhaps we need to require that the page must actually clear VFD beforehand. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 4 July 2005 07:50 (UTC)</text>

'''Sociology of the family''' is a branch of sociology studying the construction and role of families, as well as the relations both within the domestic sphere and outward into the work sphere. For this purpose sociologists use a very broad definition of family; one source renders it &quot;an intimate domestic group made up of people related to one another by bonds of blood, sexual mating, or legal ties&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Sociology ([[w:Gordon Marshall|Marshall]], 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Methodology==
Research methods in the sociology of the family can be broken down to three major approaches, each with its own strengths and weaknesses; which need be employed in a study, then, relies largely on the subject of, and questions posed by, the research.

One approach is survey research of contemporary families. This holds the benefit of leaving statistical data and large and hopefully random samples from which a researcher can interpolate the general traits of a society. However, survey respondents tend to answer as would feel regular or ideal rather than as things might actually be. It also gives a very one-sided explanation view of a larger group which does not sufficently allow for contention.

Another method is ethnographic research of families. Where surveys allow for broad but shallow analyses, observation allows sociologists to obtain rich information on a source of a much more limited size. It allows the research an &quot;insider&quot; perspective, and through this closer look a better idea of the actual social framework of families. Where surveys are strong, however, ethnographic research is weak. By reducing the size of a sample size, it may be no longer evident how representative the family being researched is to families at large within a society, and then also does not allow much room in linking the specific traits of the families being observed to a society more generally.

Finally, a researcher can use documented studies of families from the past as a source of information. These sources may include very personal items (such as diaries), legal records (census data, wills, court records), and matters of public record (such as sermons).

==History==
In attempting to explain contemporary society, it is important to look first at the social construction that lead to its development.

===Hunting and Gathering societies===
At an early stage of development societies may practice huntering and gathering. Ideal type characteristics for these societies include:

*Small groups (30-100 people)
*Open, elliptical camps
*Simplistic technology
*Children spaced apart 4-5 years in age (due to low fat diet and regular lactation)

Ideal type characteristics for labor division is as follows:
*Women
**Gather 80% of food supply
**Plant
**Manage distribution of food
**Care for children
**Build/repair shelters
*Men
**Hunt
**Prepare the fields
**Care for children
**Build structures
*Children
**Help to gather food
**Discipline is passive
**Cared for by siblings, parents, and other adults

The general ideology of these groups is typically:
*Egalitarian (no hierarchy of power; men, women, children cooperate)
*Monogamus and bilineal
**Trial marriage
**Divorce not common, nor traumatic
***No wealth to divide
***Children continue to be cared for by multiple adults

Modern governments tend to take issue with nomadic groups, often forcing them to settle in a particular location. This can have various effects on the way of life among these groups:

*Physical context
**Solid permanent structures; doors close off families from one another
**Small scale agriculture and flocks
**Private property
**Wider political and social contact for boys
*Division of labor
**Women and girls
***Preserve and prepare foods
***Begin to be seen as domestic
**Men and boys
***Care for flocks
***Broader social knowledge and ties
***Begin to be seen as public leaders
*Ideology
**Hierarchy
***Stratification by gender
***Stratification by class
**Marriage and divorce
***Become more formalized (parents take control)
***Reinforces class privilege
***Divorce becomes more problematic

'''Sweet Cornbread''' is a variant of the [[Cookbook:Skillet Cornbread | Skillet Cornbread]] made throughout central and eastern Ontario and Quebec and is sometimes known by the alternative name of Johnny Cake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia
  | title = Johnny-cake
  | encyclopedia = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]
  | volume =
  | pages =
  | publisher =
  | year = 1989
  | id =
  | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its presence in these southern regions of Canada is thought to be due to the influx of British Loyalists from what is now the Southern United States moving to the then-English-controlled colonies during the American War of Independence.

== Ingredients ==

* 256 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 cup) of cornmeal[[wikipedia:cornmeal | cornmeal]]
* 512 mL (2 cups) of flour
* 8 mL (1 1/2 teaspoons) of baking powder
* 128 mL (1/2 cup) of maple syrup
* 128 mL of brown sugar
* 128 mL of butter
* 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of salt
* 2 eggs

== Procedure ==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the butter.  Soften the butter beforehand if you must by heating it a little.
# The butter/egg mixture should be loose. Add the sugar and maple syrup, mix well, then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Mix the cornmeal and baking powder, then blend them into the liquids.
# Slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper cake batter texture. This should be softer than a cookie dough, able to stick to the mixing spool and come off in blobs.  You may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.
# Pour into a greased pan and put into an oven heated to 200°C (400°F) and let bake for between 15-25 minutes.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* When mixing the batter, be sure it is soft enough for a typical cake; you do not want it too moist or dry.  Use milk to fill in liquid you need and a half-and-half mix of flour and cornmeal if you are too moist.

* Keep a close eye on the cake while it bakes: it will become hard fast if you do not take it out in time.

* If you want to make a crisper crust take a 3 part mix of equal amounts of flour, cornmeal and brown sugar, mix well.  Add to the top of the cake half way into the baking process, but do this very quickly: leaving the door open too long will make your cake a rock.  The amount required varies based on the pan you use, so use your eyes for what you need (less than a cup total).  Despite the call for opening it halfway through baking, adding it at the beginning should work fine as well.

* You can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or plain sugar. Maple is used for its flavouring as much as its sweetness.

* Margarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this. Butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.

* This dish is usually made for after meals and outside them rather than with them, which is how its cousin [[Cookbook:Skillet Cornbread | Skillet Cornbread]] is used.  However, when having [[Cookbook:Maple Beans | Maple Beans]] and Ham, Sweet Cornbread is often served with it.

'''Grannie Gilbert's Sugar Cookies''' are a recipe of sugar cookies running with the Gilbert women of Ontario, Canada for more than 100 years.  No one knows where the recipe started, but it's been that way as long as any can recall with no real change. These cookies are very popular in Ontario and can be found in many bakeries.

==Ingredients==

* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (250-375 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 teaspoons (10 g) of [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 cup (200 g) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup (230 g) of [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]/[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]

==Procedure==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the shortening.  Soften the butter before hand if you must by heating it a little.
# The shortening/egg mixture should be loose, add the sugar, mix well then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Add the baking powder then slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper doughy state, you may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.
# Make balls and place onto a pan then into an oven heated to 175°C (350°F) and let bake for between 15-20 minutes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* Feel free to switch out half the sugar with another sweet item, like honey.
* Using three tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] one can get a slight chocolate flavour to the cookie, without being overtly chocolatey.
* Try adding chocolate chips to it.

'''Pork Tenderloin with Asparagus and Proscuitto'''

== Ingredients ==

* pork tenderloin (approx 1/2 lb)
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]
* 50g of [[Cookbook:Prosciutto|prosciutto]]
* 175ml [[Cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]] (35% fat)
* 6-10 cloves garlic
* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 2 sun-dried tomatoes
* approximately 500g linguine
* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 100ml white wine

==Procedure ==

#Trim of small patch of white reticulin. Why? Because that is tough and elastic.
#Dice the shallots and garlic and set them aside. 
#Wash and slice the asparagus into small pieces, using angled cuts for improved presentation. 
#If you wish, you may include a few slices of prosciutto (chopped) to set aside as you may want to include it in the sauce.
#Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (200 C). 
#Place the pork on a clean cutting board. Wrap the tenderloin with the slices of prosciutto, trying to wrap as tightly as possible so it will stay in place. 
#While you are doing this, also preheat an oven-safe pan to medium. Pour a few tablespoons of olive oil into the pan and place the pork inside. Start browning the meat on all sides. Once that is done, place the entire pan into the oven.
#While you are doing this, heat up another pan (preferably a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]) and pour a few tablespoons of olive oil into it. Once it's heated up, toss the garlic and shallots in and sauté them lightly. 
#Once the garlic has been sautéed to a very light brown colour, add a small amount of olive oil and the asparagus. 
#When the asparagus is slightly sautéed, add about 1/2 of the cream and about 1/4 of the wine.
#Fill a medium-sized pot 3/4 full with salted water and set on high heat on a back burner.
#Turn the tenderloin over in the pan, ensuring that the prosciutto does not fall off the meat. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and pepper.
#Reduce the sauce to about half of the original volume, and pour in the rest of the cream and wine. 
#Turn the tenderloin over again.
#Put the linguine in the boiling water and stir occasionally. You may choose to put the chopped prosciutto in at this point.
#Once the sauce has reduced down again, lower the heat and remove the pork from the oven. Place it on a clean cutting board and let it sit for a few minutes. 
#Strain the linguine and start slicing the tenderloin into small medallions. 
#Place the desired amount of linguine on each plate, and place a few medallions on top. Spoon sauce over the top.

Serves 3-4 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the term &quot;worksheet&quot; currently has a negative connotation in education, putting pencil to paper is still a practical way for students to practice what they have learned.  There are many software programs available that generate worksheets with just a few clicks of a mouse.  These can be customized for any content area, including math.  
===Types of Worksheets===
Types of sheets that can be created range from basic counting to complex algebraic equations.  Depending on the robustness of the program, teachers can input custom information and generate worksheets that are specific to a single aspect of a particular concept. An example of this would be a sheet of multiple digit multiplication problems that allows regrouping only from the hundreds place with all problems having a zero in the tens place of the top factor.
===Benefits===
Another way these customized worksheets can be beneficial is from the perspective of motivation.  Students' names can be used as part of the text for word problems.  Shared experiences can be incorporated into the worksheet to make them more relevant, as well.  Using prices and products from the school store or from a fundraiser are an excellent example of this. Some programs allow the use of graphics.  In addition, because these programs also supply answer sheets, teachers can easily have multiple versions of the same test. Worksheets are maninly beneficial for homework and additional practice or drill. Worksheet generating software can allow a student to focus on a specific skill or object and provide additional practice.

===Special Needs Students===
Textbooks rarely contain enough practice, especially for students with special needs.  With these worksheet generators, teachers have a quick and easy way to provide specific and appropriate practice so students can achieve mastery.

Teachers can also use worksheet generators to create their own lessons and units on subject matter that is not supported by the mainstream publishers.    

For many students with special needs, traditional textbooks and worksheets are designed in such a way that they hinder, rather than enhance learning.  Teachers that understand their students learning styles can design work and study sheets accordingly.  Larger fonts, more white space, and fewer problems are examples of how this might be done.  Keeping the content consistent with the regular education classroom but writing at a lower reading level allows students with special needs to access the curriculum as dictated by NCLB and other laws governing special education.

Hi, I'm a [[Swedish]] learner who usually listen to the [http://www.sr.se/ sveriges radio]. I'm interested in, [[biomechanics]]&lt;sup&gt;[[w:biomechanics|w]]&lt;/sup&gt; of [[animal locomotion]]&lt;sup&gt;[[w:animal locomotion|w]]&lt;/sup&gt;, especially [[flight]]&lt;sup&gt;[[w:Flying and gliding animals|w]]&lt;/sup&gt; of [[bird flight|birds]]&lt;sup&gt;[[w:bird flight|w]]&lt;/sup&gt; (other flying organisms include [[insect flight|insect]]&lt;sup&gt;[[w:insect flight|w]]&lt;/sup&gt;, bat&lt;sup&gt;[[w:bat|w]]&lt;/sup&gt;, and pterosaurs&lt;sup&gt;[[w:pterosaurs|w]]&lt;/sup&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:runny hunny.jpg|thumb|Extracted Honey]]

Honey is often the main desired product of beekeeping, this sweet viscous solution is the result of nectar that has undergone a physical change of having a majority of its moisture evaporated. Where as honeybees are not the only producers of honey, they are the only producers that create an excess that is harvestable.

Honey is mainly used for [[Beekeeping/Food Recipes| cooking]] or for the preparation of food and drink. Traditionally, honey is use as a sweetener in food, and is actually over one and a half times as sweet as standard table sugar. The added sweetness attributed to honey, and the fact that it will have a bouquet of [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey| different flavors]] based on the variety of nectar that was collected to make it, creates quite the attraction to cooks. Honey however is not limited to usage in edibles. Honey can also be used for many [[Beekeeping/Honey Uses |varying applications]] including usage in [[Beekeeping/Mead Making| wine making]], traditional medicine, [[Beekeeping/Cosmetic Formulas |cosmetics]], and allergy relief among [[Beekeeping/Other Hive Product Uses#Honey| other uses]].

| '''Warning''': Honey should not be fed to infants under the age of 1 or to people with sever immune system deficiencies.  This is due to possibility of botulism spores being present. This level of botulism will have no ill effect on a healthy person.

==Forms of Honey==
The majority of people living in an industrialized country have only seen and tasted processed liquid honey. This is an unfortunate occurrence, as processed honey compared to fresh honey from the hive is both bland and unexciting. There exist several common forms of honey that everyone should have the chance to try and enjoy. If one has their own hive, or truly hunts around they would likely be able to find honey in the following forms:
;[[Beekeeping/Extracted Honey|Extracted]]
: Extracted honey is honey in its standard liquid form. Although this category includes processed honey, raw honey is often the desired product. Raw honey is honey that has been extracted from the honeycomb that has not been possessed in any means, except possibly by simple filtration.
;[[Beekeeping/Comb Honey|Comb]]
: Comb honey is capped honey that is still contained within the wax comb created by the bees. It is a traditional favorite eaten wax and all, however it has more recently become difficult to easily find. Before the usage of extraction, nearly all honey came in this form.
;[[Beekeeping/Chunk Honey|Chunk]]
:Chunk honey is a cross between comb honey and extracted honey. Observation shows that it is simply smaller pieces of comb honey suspended in extracted honey. This product is notoriously hard to find in most regions without a local beekeeper.
;[[Beekeeping/Creamed Honey|Creamed]]
:Creamed honey is the generic name for liquid honey which has either has naturally crystallized or induced to crystallize by the addition of dextrose sugar or seed crystals of other crystallized honey. Creamed honey if often used as a spread for toast or bread, the only real difference between it and liquid honey is that it is more so solid and there by less likely to run.

A keen eye may also be able to spot various forms of [[Beekeeping/Adulterated Honey| adulterated honey]], which often refers to a liquid honey that has had something added to it, most often a flavor, chopped nuts, or dried fruit. While conventionally not a standard form of honey, or even a variety, adulterated honey has become a favorite of some, and is worth mentioning.

==Composition==
Honey is a solution composed mainly of sugar and water with a smaller amount of other naturally occurring compounds. The specific composition of particular sample of honey is largely dependant on the nectar source used by the bees that produced it.
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot; |+'''Chemical Composition of Honey'''
! Component || Concentration
|-
|Water || ~15 - 18 %
|-
| Fructose (Fruit Sugar) || ~38 %
|-
| Glucose || ~ 30 %
|-
| Sucrose || ~1 – 2 % 
|-
| Disaccharides|| ~7 %
|-
| Trisaccharides and Carbohydrates|| ~4%
|-
| Minor Constituents|| ~.5 %
|}

==Properties of Honey==
Consisting of mostly sugars suspended in water, honey has several interesting properties that can be exploited.
===Hygroscopic===
Honey is highly hygroscopic, meaning that it will pull moisture from the air and other mediums. Where as it is not advisable to use honey as a desiccant, many bakers incorporate honey into recipes as to keep baked goods moist. In atmospheres with a relative humidity greater than sixty percent, honey will get to work absorbing moisture from the air.

===Fermentation===
Because the moisture content of quality honey is less than seventeen percent, it will resist fermentation by most yeast. If desired, as it is sometimes, honey can be diluted to create [[mead]], but even then osmophilic yeast must be used for proper success.

===Thixotropy===
Some honeys, due to a particular plant protein refined in the nectar of a few plants, show thixotrophic properties. This means that the honey will appear to be in a sold form, akin to [[Beekeeping/Creamed Honey| creamed honey]], but will actually revert to a liquid from when slight agitated. Once the agitation stops it will quickly return to solid. Some honeys that do this include pure [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Grape Fruit| grape fruit]] and pure [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Ling| ling]] honey.
===Granulation===
Give enough time and patience, all [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey| varieties]] of honey will eventually granulate. The speed of granulation is largely dependent on the ratio of fructose to glucose within the honey, the more glucose the quicker granulation will take place. Granulation time can also be decreased by heavy agitation, such as whipping or the inclusion of seed crystals. Honey can be returned to liquid form by applying heat, though granulated honey tastes just as good.

===Antibacterial===
Honey has been show to have certain antibacterial properties, some honeys such as [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Manuka| Manuka honey]] show an even greater antibacterial strength. Because of this property honey was often spread on wounds, especially burns, to promote healing. Due the antibacterial and anti-fermentation properties of honey it is impervious to spoilage when properly kept.

==Quick Honey Facts==
*Honey weighs approximately 12 pounds per gallon  (~1.4 kg/l)
*Honey is about 1.6 times as sweet as white sugar by volume
*Average pH of honey is 3.9
*
*There are about 1380 calories in a pound (12.7 kilojoules per gram) of honey.
*To make just over 11 pounds (5 kg) of honey requires bees to travel a total distance roughly equal to a round trip from earth to the moon.
*[[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Canola| Canola]], [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey #Caster| Caster]] and [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Golden Rod| Golden Rod]] honey will all crystallize within days of extraction.
*It often takes the equivalent amount of nectar as to make between 7 and 9 pounds of honey, to create one pound of beeswax, or between 7 and 9 kilogramss of honey, to create one kilogram of beeswax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''arithmetic function''' is a function from the set of positive integers to the set of complex numbers.  Examples of important arithmetic functions include:

The Euler totient function, &amp;phi;(n) defined to be the number of positive integers less than and relatively prime to n

The Mobius function, &lt;math&gt;\mu(n) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if } n \; \mbox{is square free with an even number of prime factors}  \\ -1, &amp; \mbox{if } n \; \mbox{is square free with an odd number of prime factors}  \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e(n) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }n=1 \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The Von Mangoldt function, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases} \ln p, &amp; \mbox{if }n=p^k \mbox{ for some prime} p \mbox{and} k \ge 1 \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_k(n)=\sum_{d|n} d^k&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\theta_k(n)=n^k&lt;/math&gt;



Many of these functions are multiplicative that is they satisfy a(m)a(n)=a(mn) when m and n are relatively prime.  A function that satisfies a(m)a(n)=a(mn) even when m &amp; n are not relatively prime is called completely multiplicative.  To define a multiplicative function, a(n), it suffices to only give its values when n is the power of a prime; For a completely multiplicative function, giving its values when n is prime uniquely defines the function.

Given 2 arithmetic functions their Dirichlet convolution is defined by 

&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(n) = \sum_{d|n} a(d)b(\frac{n}{d})&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over the divisors, d, of n.  It is easy to show that

&lt;math&gt;(a * e)(n)=a(n)&lt;/math&gt;,

that is the function e(n) is the identity under Dirichlet convolution. Another basic fact is that Dirichlet convolution is commutative and associative.

It is also straightfoward to show that multiplicative functions form a group under Dirichlet convolution, or in other words, the following properties hold in addition to the fact that e(n) is the identity, and its associativity:

* for any multiplicative function a there is a multiplicative function b such that (a * b) = e

and

* the Dirichlet convolution of 2 multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.

The most important fact about the Von Mangoldt function is that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n} \Lambda(n) = \ln n&lt;/math&gt;.

The Mobius function's significance comes from the fact that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n} \mu(n) = e(n)&lt;/math&gt;,

and thus if 
&lt;math&gt;f(n)=\sum_{d|n} g(d)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g(n)=\sum_{d|n} f(d) \mu(\frac{n}{d})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Optimizing hints ===

When this program executes, the computer will check all conditions in order until one of them matches its concept of truth. As soon as this occurs, the program will execute the statement immediately following the condition and continue on, without checking any other condition for truth. For this reason, when you are trying to [[Wikipedia:Optimization_%28computer_science%29|optimize]] a program, it is a good idea to sort your if-else conditions in descending [[Probability/Introduction|probability]]. This will ensure that in the most common scenarios, the computer has to do less work, as it will most likely only have to check one or two &quot;branches&quot; before it finds the statement which it should execute. However, when writing programs for the first time, try not to think about this too much lest you find yourself undertaking [[w:Premature_optimization#When_to_optimize|premature optimization]].

Having said all that, you should be aware that an [[w:Optimizing_compiler|optimizing compiler]] might rearrange your ''if statement'' at will when the statement in question is free from [[w:Side-effect_(computer_science)|side effects]]. Among other techniques optimizing compilers might even apply [[w:Jump_table|jump tables]] and [[w:Binary_search|binary searches]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Other languages ==

When changing inside the [[Computer Programming/Control]] do have a look how your change will affect the other languages - you don't have to fix them - but do consider them.

== Subroutines &amp; Subprograms ==

I program a lot in [[Report Program Generator Programming|RPG]] which uses Subroutines &amp; Subprograms which can be like functions.  There are work variables associated with the subroutine or subprogram ... feed the info in, call it, when it is done it returns the answers.  Thus we develop standard routines to do standard functions which can be used as building blocks for many different programs.  Is this considered to be part of Control Statements, or another element of programming? [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 09:08, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

=== Procedures and functions ===

I guess the proper place would be [[Computer Programming/Procedures and functions]]. The X dependency should be removed and replaced by a language independent definition.

== Evil Goto by scenario ==

Perhaps there should be a separate article on the pros &amp; cons of GOTO and perhaps I should write some of it.

When accepting complex input, we can avoid GOTO using cumbersome code like this
# Start Point of setting up variables
# Populate variables associated with starting point of the data to be read
# Clear flags or variables used to track whether input will be Ok, that are neccessary to manage the loop
# Define the loop such that we fall out if after all the rigamarole, there are no problems.
# Start Point of loop
# Give screen to user to supply data, or access file or whatever
# Get the data
# Analyse the data
# If whatever problem, put error message into relevant variable, or reset so as to read next record in file.
# Also set flag indicating problem requiring return to start point of loop
# Conditions of loop either mean we fall out, or return to Start Point of loop
# Now that we have good data we can process it

Or we can have much easier to read code with GOTO.
# Start Point of setting up variables
# Populate variables associated with starting point of the data to be read
# Start Point of loop
# Give screen to user to supply data, or access file or whatever
# Get the data
# Analyse the data
# If whatever problem, put error message into relevant variable, or reset so as to read next record in file.
# GOTO Start Point
# Now that we have good data we can process it
[[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 09:02, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

The algorithm using GOTO has some problems:
* The GOTO target 'Start Point' is not defined. There is a 'Start Point of setting up variables' and a 'Start Point of loop', which one do you mean?
* It describes an endless loop, as there seems to be no conditional.  In other words, replace the unconditional GOTO by this step: 'Conditions of loop either mean we fall out, or return to Start Point of loop (via GOTO)'
* This step is missing: 'Clear flags or variables used to track whether input will be Ok, that are necessary to manage the loop'
* This step is missing: 'Also set flag indicating problem requiring return to start point of loop'

The description of the algorithm without GOTO mentions the same functionality twice:
* Define the loop such that we fall out if after all the rigamarole, there are no problems.
* Conditions of loop either mean we fall out, or return to Start Point of loop

Also,
* prefer to simplify the discussion by combining all initialization steps (common to both algos) into a single step.
* Similarly, combine all loop body steps (common to both algos) into a single step.

If these points are fixed, both algorithms are of the same subjective complexity.

== Non-local exit considered harmful ==

:&quot;Because the use of a goto needs the declaration of a label, the goto is in fact as twice as readable than the use of return. So if readability is your concern and not a strict &quot;don't use goto&quot; programming rule then you should rather use goto than multiple returns. Best, of course, is the structured approach where neither goto nor multiple returns are needed:&quot;

It's odd to see such an old chestnut from the Structured Programming Wars resurface. The fact is that non-local exits are ''sometimes'' bad, and ''sometimes'' preferable to a morass of if-elses. Consider a C-like language with no exception constructs:
&lt;pre&gt;
        int widgetcontainer_add(container c, widget w) {
            if (w == null) return ERR_NULL_POINTER;
            if (w.chroma &lt; colors.green) return ERR_OFF_COLOR_WIDGET;
            if (c.count &gt;= c.capacity) return ERR_CONTAINER_FULL;

            c.items[c.front++] = w;
            return OK;
        }
&lt;/pre&gt;
The solution here, of course, is &quot;use exceptions, not error codes&quot;, but failing that, multiple returns are a lot more readable than the structured alternative:
&lt;pre&gt;
        int widgetcontainer_add(container c, widget w) {
            int result = OK;
            if (w == null) {
                result = ERR_NULL_POINTER;
            } else if (w.chroma &lt; colors.green) {
                result = ERR_OFF_COLOR_WIDGET;
            } else if (c.count &gt;= c.capacity) {
                result = ERR_CONTAINER_FULL;
            } else {
                c.items[c.front++] = w;
            }
            return result;
        }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here the nature of the checks is completely obscured, as is the &quot;real code&quot;, which is just the last in a long line of alternatives. The reason people promote such code anyway is not readability, but consistency of form, which is actually much of what structured programming is about.

The idea behind restricting (or forbidding) non-local exits is that as the function grows longer, the control flow gets more and more unclear if there are multiple points of exit (&quot;If parameter x is 5, did we exit here or here or here? Does this piece of code ever get executed?&quot;) The &quot;non-structured&quot; answer to this is simply not to use big functions (or methods/blocks/closures/whatever), since they are much more problematic than the control structures you use ''within'' functions will ever be.

A bigger straw man here is claiming that the version with goto is in fact &quot;twice as readable&quot; because a label is involved. Say what? Is the reader supposed to glance over a &quot;return&quot; statement, or something, or forget that &quot;return&quot; exits the function? I don't know what the author was thinking here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economic policy''' is what a government does to ensure the economy keeps ticking over, and doesn't '''overheat''' or fall into '''recession'''. Look back to the page on [[Macroeconomics/Macroeconomic_objectives| macroeconomic objectives]] to remind yourself of government objectives. This section will go further into the ''reasons'' for government, and ''how'' policy can be applied.

== Reasons for Economic Policy ==
=== Natural Changes in Economic Activity ===
Most economies go through cycles of strong economic growth and recession; it is much debated as to why this happens - arguably as a result of government policies, expectations of such cycles or other reasons. However, &lt;b&gt;negative multiplier effects&lt;/b&gt; can ensure that an economy left to itself would be incapable of getting out of recession. A demonstration of a negative multiplier effect can be seen in areas that have recently suffered increased unemployment. Those recently unemployed will have less disposable income, causing other industries to suffer a fall in demand, resulting potentially in further layoffs of workers. When this happens on a national scale, targetted government spending may be the only way of getting out of this situation.

Secondly, remember that a macroeconomic objective is '''stable and sustainable''' economic growth. Economies, left to themselves, also have a tendency for runaway increases in demand without comparable increases in supply, resulting in high levels of inflation and borrowing and a booming stock market, which will hurt all the more when economic growth slows down.

=== Economic Shocks ===
These are unexpected, sudden changes in the situation of the world economy or domestically. For example, a housing market crash or recently 9/11 are examples where the home/world economy was entirely unprepared. These shocks have an effect on the demand and supply of goods, as a result of changes in consumer confidence, business confidence and expectations of the future. In order for a government to reduce the impact of such blows, it must be able to partially control the demand and supply curves.
''diagrams of SRAS and D-side shocks''

== Application of Economic Policy ==
There are three main method of government macroecnomic intervention in an economy, all of which will be investigated in more detail later in this section (the imbedded links are to wikipedia, the links to the relevant section in the wikibook are in the template on the right):
* [[w:Fiscal policy| Fiscal policy]] - is the use of government spending and taxation as a means of controlling levels of AD, both directly and indirectly
* [[w:Monetary policy| Monetary policy]] - is the use of changing interest rates and the money supply to control the exchange rate, level of borrowing and levels of saving (remember MPC and MPS)
* Supply-side Policies - are a general term for all the other policies the government can employ to aid the level of supply, which is particularly important in increasing the potential output of an economy, and reducing growth-induced inflation

I hope you won't mind my asking you to look at [[Mishnah Sotah 3:1]] (the last mishnah you contributed), to see how links at the top of the mishnah page can be set up. You can simply copy the links on 3:1 for other mishnayot too, and change the numbers. It's easy.

I've also added a &quot;category&quot; for the seder (look at the bottom of 3:1).

It would be wonderful if you logged in, so you could take credit for your translations!

== New discussion ==
''Moved to [[:s:Wikisource talk:Annotations]].''

== Suggested Additions ==
I would like to see the text thats been removed from WB:WIW/Unstable added/incorporated to this policy. Which was:

Annotated texts are guides for helping readers study and understand published literature and other media that includes a copy of the original work within it. For example, Introduction to Shakespeare or Darwin's The Descent of Man. By developing these guides, we are trying to make it easier for students to study such material. Our sister project Wikisource, which collects public domain and freely licensed works that already exist, also allows annotated texts; it is a place of overlap between the two projects.

See Wikibooks:Annotated texts for our complete policy. Briefly there are two main limitations:

# Planned annotated texts with only slim prospects of ever actually becoming annotated may become candidates for deletion.
# Annotated editions of previously published works may only be written if use of the source text does not constitute a copyright infringement. Otherwise, these works are the property of someone else; we should respect their rights and avoid legal trouble. Copyright violations are suitable grounds for speedy deletion.

== Clarification to text ==

On the main namespace version it says {{cquote|The source text has absolutely no annotations, or the annotation is so minimal that its erasure constitutes no loss of educational material.}} Can I suggest that this has an element of ambiguity, especially where the work itself may be inherently educational material.  I presume that we are meaning the ''loss of (one of) '''additional/annotated/complementary''' educational material.'' [[User:Billinghurst|Billinghurst]] ([[User talk:Billinghurst|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Billinghurst|contribs]]) 14:32, 17 June 2011 (UTC)
:Well, this hasn't been really modified since 2007 and I may be one of the few watching it, but my interpretation is that if a book is just a source text or has worthless annotations that if removed would leave it just as a source text, then it should be moved to Wikisource. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:43, 18 June 2011 (UTC)
:: As I understand the text, the qualification being asked about is already there.  The passage in question is the third of three criteria, all of which must hold at once for the text to be recommended for deletion.  (I've tried to clarify that in the text.)  The second criterion says that if the text is inherently educational, it should probably stay here, as sooner or later someone will want to write annotations.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:59, 18 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

== What is an annotated text? ==

An '''annotated text''' contains two elements:
#A copy of a published original [[:w:primary source|primary source]] text or other established narrative, academic or literary media, available under a Wikibooks-compatible license.
#Various kinds of study aids for reading, understanding, and teaching the text, known as annotations. These may include explanatory notes, introductions, summaries, questions and answers, charts, lists, indices, references, wikilinks, media, etc.

In an annotated text the annotations are interwoven with the primary source text in order to make the book more reader-friendly. The goal of an annotated text is to facilitate reading and comprehension of the source media, especially in a classroom environment in preparation for formal examinations, or even for private study (for instance, the classic ''Cliff's Notes'' on Shakespeare are meant to help students prepare for examinations on literature that they read at home.) Because annotated texts are a kind of educational material it has been declared as Wikibooks policy to include them. This is despite the fact that most primary source texts normally belong at [[:s:|Wikisource]].

It may also be possible for Wikibookians to annotate other forms of narrative media besides just written texts. For instance, it may be possible to annotate a motion picture, a video game, or a musical song/album. Such cases might be permitted under this policy if they are shown to be academic and well-written.

For guidelines on how to distinguish which texts belong on which project, please see Wikisource's article [[:s:Wikisource:Wikisource and Wikibooks|Wikisource and Wikibooks]]. There are no absolute rules for texts of this kind and any reasonable decision by the contributor(s) should be respected.

== Source texts without annotations ==

A number of source texts have been contributed to Wikibooks over the course of time with the express intention of using them as part of annotated text and a few have actually been annotated to one degree or another. However, little or no annotation has been written for the majority of these texts. Source texts without annotations belong at [[:s:|Wikisource]]. Even some texts with annotations may reasonably be kept at Wikisource, provided that the primary focus is on the source text, not on classroom instruction or test preparation.

In general, the good-faith intentions and work of a contributor who added an important source text to Wikibooks should be honored. This is true even if its takes a very long time until annotations are written. Nevertheless, these texts are really more appropriate for Wikisource than for Wikibooks. Therefore, they may become candidates for deletion if and when the following criteria are all met:

*The source text also exists in the same format at Wikisource.
*The source text is not a text widely used in classrooms for which there will clearly be a need for future annotations and interest in writing them.
**For an example that does '''not''' meet this criterion, take the works of Shakespeare. These are central classroom texts and cultural icons. Thus there is a clear demand for annotations of them, and there are clearly people who will be interested in writing them at some point. Therefore, the copies of these texts might as well be left at Wikibooks, even though they also exist at Wikisource.
*The source text has absolutely no annotations, or the annotation is so minimal that its erasure constitutes no loss of educational material.

When all of the above criteria are met, a book may become a candidate for deletion.

It should also be noted that Wikibooks is a multilingual project. A text here at English Wikibooks may also be part of a larger multilingual annotation project. If annotations to a book are proceeding in another language, and the passages are linked, then the English version should be kept even if it has no annotations. For example, if Shakespeare is being annotated in German, then the German contributors should be able to simply put an &quot;en:&quot; link to connect to the original English version of each unit of text. They should not be forced to link to the Wikisource version just because there is very little annotation yet in English.

== Creating an annotated text ==

In general, break your text into user-friendly sections (e.g. chapters), each of which must be linked to and from the title page using the standard  [[WB:NP|naming convention]].

If you want to start annotating a large text, there is no need to add the entire source text immediately at the beginning. Instead, start by copying and annotating a limited initial portion of the text. Later sections can be added to Wikibooks at a future date when the annotation is already substantial. By implementing this suggestion you can maintain a reasonable balance between the source text and your annotations at all stages of the project from beginning to end.

When you start a Wikibooks project to annotate a text, please list the main title page in the following place:
*[[Subject:Literature]] - The related subjects cover texts of different genres.  Please list your book in its respective genre(s) by adding it to the subject category of the same name using {{tl|subjects}}.

== Other relevant pages ==
*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#A repository for source texts|Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]]
*[[s:Wikisource:Annotations|Wikisource:Annotations]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The goal of this chapter is to introduce the methods employed by sociologists in their study of social life.  This is not a chapter on statistics nor does it detail specific methods in sociological investigation.  The primary aim is to illustrate how sociologists go beyond common sense understandings in trying to explain or understand social phenomena.

==The Development of Social Science==
[[File:Sigmund Freud LIFE.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sigmund Freud, one of the first people to explore human relationships scientifically.]]

In ancient philosophy, there was no difference between the liberal arts of mathematics and the study of history, poetry or politics - only with the development of mathematical proof did there gradually arise a perceived difference between ''scientific'' disciplines and the ''humanities'' or ''liberal arts''. Thus, [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] studied planetary motion and poetry with the same methods, and [[w:Plato|Plato]] mixed geometrical proofs with his demonstration on the state of intrinsic knowledge. 

This unity of science as descriptive remained, for example, in the time of [[w:Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] who argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework; his book, ''[[w:Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'', was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. Within decades of Hobbes' work a revolution took place in what constituted ''science'', particularly with the work of [[w:Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton]] in physics. Newton, by revolutionizing what was then called ''natural philosophy'', changed the basic framework by which individuals understood what was ''scientific''. 

While Newton was merely the archetype of an accelerating trend, the important distinction is that for Newton the mathematical flowed from a presumed reality independent of the observer and it worked by its own rules. For philosophers of the same period, mathematical expression of philosophical ideals were taken to be symbolic of natural human relationships as well: the same laws moved physical and spiritual reality. For examples see [[w:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]], [[w:Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[w:Johannes Kepler|Johannes Kepler]], each of whom took mathematical examples as models for human behavior directly. In Pascal's case, the famous wager; for Leibniz, the invention of binary computation; and for Kepler, the intervention of angels to guide the planets.

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William James was one of the first Americans to explore human relations scientifically.]]

In the realm of other disciplines, this created a pressure to express ideas in the form of mathematical relationships. Such relationships, called ''Laws'' after the usage of the time (see [[w:philosophy of science|philosophy of science]]) became the model that other disciplines would emulate. In the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about human behavior became increasingly common. Among the first were the ''Laws'' of philology, which attempted to map the change over time of sounds in a language. In the early 20th century, a wave of change came to science that saw ''[[w:statistics|statistical]]'' study sufficiently mathematical to be ''science''.

The first thinkers to attempt to combine scientific inquiry with the exploration of human relationships were [[w:Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]] in Austria and [[w:William James|William James]] in the United States. Freud's theory of the functioning of the mind and James' work on experimental psychology had an enormous impact on those who followed. 

With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences (see, for example [[w:Lord Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]]'s famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically &quot;is a poor sort of knowledge&quot;), the stage was set for the conception of the humanities as being precursors to ''social science''.

==The Scientific Method==
A scientific method or process is considered fundamental to the scientific investigation and acquisition of new knowledge based upon verifiable evidence. In addition to employing the scientific method in their research, sociologists explore the social world with several different purposes in mind.  Like the physical sciences (i.e., chemistry, physics, etc.), sociologists can be and often are interested in predicting outcomes given knowledge of the variables and relationships involved.  This approach to ''doing science'' is often termed ''[[w:positivism|positivism]]'' (though perhaps more accurately should be called ''[[w:empiricism|empiricism]]'').  The positivist approach to social science seeks to explain and predict social phenomena, often employing a quantitative approach.  But unlike the physical sciences, sociology (and other social sciences, like [[w:anthropology|anthropology]]) also often seek simply to understand social phenomena.  Max Weber labeled this approach ''[[w:Verstehen|Verstehen]]'', which is German for ''understanding''.  In this approach the goal is to understand a [[w:culture|culture]] or phenomenon on its own terms rather than trying to develop a theory that allow for prediction.  Both approaches employ a scientific method as they make observations and gather data, propose hypotheses, and test their hypotheses in the formulation of theories.  These steps are outlined in more detail below.

Sociologists use observations, hypotheses and deductions to propose explanations for social phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions from these theories are tested. If a prediction turns out to be correct, the theory survives. If not, the theory is modified or discarded.  The method is commonly taken as the underlying logic of scientific practice. Science is essentially an extremely cautious means of building a supportable, evidenced understanding of our natural world.

The essential elements of a scientific method are iterations and recursions of the following four steps:

# Characterization (operationalization or quantification, observation and measurement)
# Hypothesis (a theoretical, hypothetical explanation of the observations and measurements)
# Prediction (logical deduction from the hypothesis)
# Experiment (test of all of the above; in the social sciences, ''true experiments'' are often replaced with a different form of data analysis that will be discussed in more detail below)

===Characterization===
A scientific method depends upon a careful characterization of the subject of the investigation. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subject, this careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations; the observation often demands careful measurement and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between [[w:pseudoscience|pseudo-sciences,]] such as [[w:alchemy|alchemy]], and a science, such as [[w:chemistry|chemistry]]. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [[w:correlation|correlation]] and [[w:regression|regression]], performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as human populations. The measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers, spectroscopes, or voltmeters, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and development.

Measurements demand the use of ''operational definitions'' of relevant quantities (a.k.a. ''[[w:operationalization|operationalization]]''). That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or ''idealized'' definition. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of ''mass'' ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a certain kilogram of platinum kept in a laboratory in France.  In short, to operationalize a variable means creating an operational definition for a concept someone intends to measure.  How this is done is very important as it should be done with enough precision that independent researchers should be able to use your description of your measurement and repeat it.

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage. For example, ''sex'' and ''gender'' are often used interchangeably in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in sociology. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.

Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities that are used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to limitations of the method used. Counts may only represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken (see the [[w:central limit theorem|central limit theorem]]).

===Hypothesis Development===
A hypothesis includes a suggested explanation of the subject. It will generally provide a causal explanation or propose some association between two variables.  If the hypothesis is a causal explanation, it will involve at least one ''[[w:dependent variable|dependent variable]]'' and one ''[[w:independent variable|independent variable]]''.  

Variables are measurable phenomena whose values can change (e.g., class status can range from lower- to upper-class). A dependent variable is a [[w:variable (social science)|variable]] whose values are presumed to change as a result of the independent variable.  In other words, the value of a dependent variable ''depends'' on the value of the independent variable.  Of course, this assumes that there is an actual relationship between the two variables.  If there is no relationship, then the value of the ''dependent variable'' does not depend on the value of the independent variable.  An ''independent variable'' is a variable whose value is manipulated by the experimenter (or, in the case of non-experimental analysis, changes in the society and is measured). Perhaps an example will help clarify.  In a study of the influence of gender on promotion, the independent variable would be gender/sex.  Promotion would be the dependent variable.  Change in promotion is hypothesized to be dependent on gender. 

Scientists use whatever they can — their own creativity, ideas from other fields, induction, systematic guessing, etc. — to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. There are no definitive guidelines for the production of new hypotheses. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a ''flash of inspiration'', or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea.

===Prediction===
A useful hypothesis will enable predictions, by deductive reasoning, that can be experimentally assessed. If results contradict the predictions, then the hypothesis under examination is incorrect or incomplete and requires either revision or abandonment. If results confirm the predictions, then the hypothesis might be correct but is still subject to further testing. Predictions refer to experimental designs with a currently unknown outcome. A prediction (of an unknown) differs from a consequence (which can already be known).

===Experiment===
Once a prediction is made, an experiment is designed to test it. The experiment may seek either confirmation or falsification of the hypothesis. 

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed record keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and providing evidence of the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results. 

[[File:Milgram Experiment.png|thumb|200px|right|This is a diagram of the famous [[w:Milgram Experiment|Milgram Experiment]] which explored [[w:obedience|obedience]] and [[w:authority|authority]] in light of the crimes committed by the Nazis in World War II.]]

The experiment's integrity should be ascertained by the introduction of a control. Two virtually identical experiments are run, in only one of which the factor being tested is varied. This serves to further isolate any causal phenomena. For example in testing a drug it is important to carefully test that the supposed effect of the drug is produced only by the drug. Doctors may do this with a double-blind study: two virtually identical groups of patients are compared, one of which receives the drug and one of which receives a [[w:placebo|placebo]]. Neither the patients nor the doctor know who is getting the real drug, isolating its effects.  This type of experiment is often referred to as a ''[[w:experiment|true experiment]]'' because of its design.  It is contrasted with alternative forms below.

Once an experiment is complete, a researcher determines whether the results (or data) gathered are what was predicted. If the experimental conclusions fail to match the predictions/hypothesis, then one returns to the failed hypothesis and re-iterates the process - modifying one's theory or developing a new one. If the experiment appears ''successful'' - i.e. fits the hypothesis - the experimenter often will attempt to publish the results so that others (in theory) may reproduce the same experimental results, verifying the findings in the process.

An experiment is not an absolute requirement. In observation based fields of science actual experiments must be designed differently than for the classical laboratory based sciences. Due to ethical concerns and the sheer cost of manipulating large segments of society, sociologists often turn to other methods for testing hypotheses.  In lieu of holding variables constant in laboratory settings, sociologists employ statistical techniques (e.g., [[w:regression|regression]]) that allow them to control the variables in the analysis rather than in the data collection. For instance, in examining the effects of gender on promotions, sociologists may ''control'' for the effects of social class as this variable will likely influence the relationship.  Unlike a ''true experiment'' where these variables are held constant in a laboratory setting, sociologists use statistical methods to hold constant social class (or, better stated, partial out the variance accounted for by social class) so they can see the relationship between gender and promotions without the interference of social class.  Thus, while the ''true experiment'' is ideally suited for the performance of science, especially because it is the best method for deriving ''causal relationships'', other methods of ''hypothesis testing'' are commonly employed in the social sciences.

===Evaluation and Iteration===
The scientific process is iterative. At any stage it is possible that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. For instance, failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject.

It is also important to note that science is a social enterprise, and scientific work will become accepted by the community only if it can be verified. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community. All scientific knowledge is in a state of flux, for at any time new evidence could be presented that contradicts a long-held hypothesis. For this reason, scientific journals use a process of [[w:peer review|peer review]], in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three) fellow (usually anonymous) scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. The referees may or may not recommend publication, publication with suggested modifications, or, sometimes, publication in another journal. This serves to keep the scientific literature free of unscientific work, helps to cut down on obvious errors, and generally otherwise improves the quality of the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moghissi2010&quot;&gt;Moghissi, A. Alan. 2010. “Peer Review and Scientific Assessment.” Technology &amp; Innovation 12:187-188.&lt;/ref&gt; Work announced in the popular press before going through this process is generally frowned upon. Sometimes peer review inhibits the circulation of unorthodox work, and at other times may be too permissive. The peer review process is not always successful, but has been very widely adopted by the scientific community.

The ''[[w:reproducibility|reproducibility]]'' or replication of scientific observations, while usually described as being very important in a scientific method, is actually seldom reported, and is in reality often not done. Referees and editors often reject papers purporting only to reproduce some observations as being unoriginal and not containing anything new. Occasionally reports of a failure to reproduce results are published - mostly in cases where controversy exists or a suspicion of fraud develops. The threat of failure to replicate by others, however, serves as a very effective deterrent for most scientists, who will usually replicate their own data several times before attempting to publish.

Sometimes useful observations or phenomena themselves cannot be reproduced. They may be rare, or even unique events. Reproducibility of observations and replication of experiments is not a guarantee that they are correct or properly understood. Errors can all too often creep into more than one laboratory.

==Correlation and Causation==
[[File:Correlation vs causation.png|thumb|250px|right|This diagram illustrates the difference between correlation and causation, as ice cream consumption is correlated with crime, but both are dependent on temperature.  Thus, the correlation between ice cream consumption and crime is spurious.]]

In the scientific pursuit of prediction and explanation, two relationships between variables are often confused: [[w:correlation|correlation]] and [[w:causation|causation]].  Correlation refers to a relationship between two (or more) variables in which they change together.  A correlation can be positive/direct or negative/inverse.  A positive correlation means that as one variable increases (e.g., ice cream consumption) the other variable also increases (e.g., crime).  A negative correlation is just the opposite; as one variable increases (e.g., [[w:socioeconomic|socioeconomic status]]), the other variable decreases (e.g., [[w:infant mortality rate|infant mortality rates]]).

Causation refers to a relationship between two (or more) variables where one variable causes the other.  In order for a variable to cause another, it must meet the following three criteria:
* the variables must be correlated
* change in the independent variable must precede change in the dependent variable in time
* it must be shown that a different (third) variable is not causing the change in the two variables of interest (a.k.a., ''[[w:spurious|spurious correlation]]'')

An example may help explain the difference. Ice cream consumption is positively correlated with incidents of crime.  

Employing the scientific method outlined above, the reader should immediately question this relationship and attempt to discover an explanation. It is at this point that a simple yet noteworthy phrase should be introduced: ''correlation is not causation''.  If you look back at the three criteria of causation above, you will notice that the relationship between ice cream consumption and crime meets only one of the three criteria (they change together).  The real explanation of this relationship is the introduction of a third variable: temperature.  Ice cream consumption and crime increase during the summer months.  Thus, while these two variables are correlated, ice cream consumption does not cause crime or vice versa.  Both variables increase due to the increasing temperatures during the summer months.

It is important to not confound a correlation with a cause/effect relationship.  It is often the case that correlations between variables are found but the relationship turns out to be spurious.  Clearly understanding the relationship between variables is an important element of the scientific process.

=Quantitative and Qualitative=
Like the distinction drawn between ''positivist'' sociology and ''Verstehen'' sociology, there is often a distinction drawn between two types of sociological investigation: ''quantitative'' and ''qualitative''.  

[[w:Quantitative method|Quantitative methods]] of sociological research approach social phenomena from the perspective that they can be measured and/or ''quantified''.  For instance, social class, following the quantitative approach, can be divided into different groups - upper-, middle-, and lower-class - and can be measured using any of a number of variables or a combination thereof: income, educational attainment, prestige, power, etc. Quantitative sociologists tend to use specific methods of data collection and hypothesis testing, including: [[w:experiment|experimental designs]], [[w:survey|surveys]], [[w:secondary data analysis|secondary data analysis]], and [[w:statistics|statistical analysis]].

[[w:Qualitative method|Qualitative methods]] of sociological research tend to approach social phenomena from the ''Verstehen'' perspective.  They are used to develop a deeper understanding of a particular phenomenon. They also often deliberately give up on quantity - necessary for statistical analysis - in order to reach a depth in analysis of the phenomenon studied.  Even so, qualitative methods can be used to propose relationships between variables. Qualitatively oriented sociologists tend to employ different methods of data collection and hypothesis testing, including: [[w:participant observation|participant observation]], [[w:interview|interviews]], [[w:focus group|focus groups]], [[w:content analysis|content analysis]] and [[w:historical comparison|historical comparison]].

While there are sociologists who employ and encourage the use of only one or the other method, many sociologists see benefits in combining the approaches. They view quantitative and qualitative approaches as complementary. Results from one approach can fill gaps in the other approach. For example, quantitative methods could describe large or general patterns in society while qualitative approaches could help to explain how individuals understand those patterns.

=Objective vs. Critical=
Sociologists, like all humans, have values, beliefs, and even pre-conceived notions of what they might find in doing their research. Because sociologists are not immune to the desire to change the world, two approaches to sociological investigation have emerged.  By far the most common is the ''objective'' approach advocated by Max Weber.  Weber recognized that social scientists have opinions, but argued against the expression of non-professional or non-scientific opinions in the classroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1946&quot;&gt;Weber, Max. 1946. Science As Vocation. Gerth, H. H. and Mills, C. Wright, Editors and Translators. From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology. New York: Oxford University Press; pp. 129-156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weber took this position for several reasons, but the primary one outlined in his discussion of ''Science as Vocation'' is that he believed it is not right for a person in a position of authority (a professor) to force his/her students to accept his/her opinions in order for them to pass the class.  Weber did argue that it was acceptable for social scientists to express their opinions outside of the classroom and advocated for social scientists to be involved in politics and other social activism.  The ''objective'' approach to social science remains popular in sociological research and refereed journals because it refuses to engage social issues at the level of opinions and instead focuses intently on data and theories.

The ''objective'' approach is contrasted with the ''critical'' approach, which has its roots in Karl Marx's work on economic structures.  Anyone familiar with Marxist theory will recognize that Marx went beyond describing society to advocating for change.  Marx disliked capitalism and his analysis of that economic system included the call for change.  This approach to sociology is often referred to today as ''critical'' sociology (see also ''[[w:action research|action research]]'').  Some sociological journals focus on critical sociology and some sociological approaches are inherently critical (e.g., feminism, black feminist thought).

=Ethics=
Ethical considerations are of particular importance to sociologists because of the subject of investigation - people.  Because ethical considerations are of so much importance, sociologists adhere to a rigorous set of ethical guidelines.  The most important ethical consideration of sociological research is that participants in sociological investigation are not harmed.  While exactly what this entails can vary from study to study, there are several universally recognized considerations.  For instance, research on children and youth always requires parental consent.  Research on adults also requires ''[[w:informed consent|informed consent]]'' and participants are never forced to participate.  ''[[w:Confidentiality|Confidentiality]]'' and ''[[w:anonymity|anonymity]]'' are two additional practices that ensure the safety of participants when sensitive information is provided (e.g., sexuality, income, etc.). To ensure the safety of participants, most universities maintain an ''[[w:institutional review board|institutional review board]]'' (IRB) that reviews studies that include human participants and ensures ethical rigor.

It has not always been the case that scientists interested in studying humans have followed ethical principles in their research.  Several studies that, when brought to light, led to the introduction of ethical principles guiding human subjects research and [[w:Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] to ensure compliance with those principles, are worth noting, including the [[w:Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], in which 399 impoverished black men with [[w:syphilis|syphilis]] were left untreated to track the progress of the disease and [[w:Nazi human experimentation|Nazi experimentation on humans]].  A recent paper by Susan M. Reverby &lt;ref name=&quot;Reverby2011&quot;&gt;Reverby, Susan M. 2011. &quot;Normal Exposure&quot; and Inoculation Syphilis: A PHS &quot;Tuskegee&quot; Doctor in Guatemala, 1946-48. Journal of Policy History.&lt;/ref&gt; found that such unethical experiments were more widespread than just the widely known Tuskegee study and that the US Government funded a study in which thousands of Guatemalan prisoners were infected with syphilis to determine whether they could be cured with penicillin.  Ethical oversight in science is designed to prevent such egregious violations of human rights today.

Sociologists also have professional ethical principles they follow.  Obviously honesty in research, analysis, and publication is important.  Sociologists who manipulate their data are ostracized and will have their memberships in professional organizations revoked.  [[w:Conflict of interest|Conflicts of interest]] are also frowned upon.  A conflict of interest can occur when a sociologist is given funding to conduct research on an issue that relates to the source of the funds.  For example, if Microsoft were to fund a sociologist to investigate whether users of Microsoft's product users are happier than users of [[w:open source|open source]] software (e.g., [[w:Linux|Linux]], [[w:Openoffice|Openoffice.org]]), the sociologist would need to disclose the source of the funding as it presents a significant conflict of interest.  A comprehensive explanation of sociological guidelines is provided on the website of the [http://www.asanet.org/cs/root/leftnav/ethics/ethics American Sociological Association].

=What Can Sociology Tell Us?=
Having discussed the sociological approach to understanding society, it is worth noting the limitations of sociology.  Because of the subject of investigation (society), sociology runs into a number of problems that have significant implications for this field of inquiry:
* human behavior is complex, making prediction - especially at the individual level - difficult or even impossible
* the presence of researchers can affect the phenomenon being studied ([[w:Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne Effect]])
* society is constantly changing, making it difficult for sociologists to maintain current understandings; in fact, society might even change as a result of sociological investigation (for instance, sociologists testified in the [[w:Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education]] decision to integrate schools)
* it is difficult for sociologists to remain objective when the phenomena they study is also part of their social life

While it is important to recognize the limitations of sociology, sociology's contributions to our understanding of society have been significant and continue to provide useful theories and tools for understanding humans as social beings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic premise of conflict theory is that individuals and groups in society struggle to maximize their share of the limited resources that exist and are desired by humans.  Given that there are limited resources, the struggle inevitably leads to conflict and competition.  These struggles can lead to changes in institutions and societies as different groups come into power. 

==Detailed Description==
--[[Special:Contributions/165.155.200.66|165.155.200.66]] ([[User talk:165.155.200.66|discuss]]) 19:58, 11 February 2013 (UTC)===Theoretical Assumptions===
Assumptions are taken for granted statements about reality that theories drawn upon as their foundation.  Following are some of assumptions of modern conflict theory:&lt;ref name=&quot;Plunkett&quot;&gt;[Plunkett, Scott, and Scott Williams. n.d. “CONFLICT THEORY.” Retrieved April 19, 2011 (http://www.csun.edu/~whw2380/542/Conflict%20theory.htm).]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Interactions'': Human interaction results in conflict.  
* ''Change'': Conflict and change are normal and inevitable in society.
* ''Competition'': Competition over scarce resources (e.g., money, leisure, sexual partners, etc.) is part of all social groups. Competition rather than consensus is characteristic of human relationships.  If everyone had the resources they needed, conflict would not exist.
* ''Structural Inequality'': Inequalities in power and rewards are built into all social structures.  Resources are scarce and groups will always compete over these resources.
* ''Degree of Inequality'': Inequality exists in varying degrees with people having different amounts of resources; hierarchies exist.
* ''Revolution'': Macro changes occur as a result of conflict between competing interests rather than through adaptation. It is often abrupt and revolutionary rather than evolutionary.

===Key Terms===
Below are some of the key terms employed in social conflict theories.

*Class conflict: The struggle between groups occupying different socioeconomic positions in the same society. These groups compete for control of economic, political and social resources. Class conflict can manifest as physical violence, [[w:propaganda|propaganda]] (e.g., the spread of ideologies, such as &quot;[[w:homeless|homeless]] people are lazy&quot;), economic threats (e.g., the middle class boycotting &quot;[[w:Big Business|Big Business]]&quot;), or legal battles (e.g., [[w:class action lawsuits|class action lawsuits]] by consumers against large [[w:corporations|corporations]]).
*[[w:Ideology|Ideology]]: the collection of beliefs that justify a social arrangement
*Social class: an aspect of social location that is determined by either your relationship to the means of production (Marx) or your power, prestige and wealth (Weber). 
*[[w:Deviance|Deviance]]: going against prevailing social norms
*[[w:Proletariat|Proleteriat]]: in Marx’s economic conflict theory, the proletariat are the working class who did not own the resources, land or tools they use to produce goods for the bourgeoisie
*[[w:Bourgeoisie|Bourgeoisie]]: in Marx’s economic conflict theory, the bourgeoisie are the capitalist class who own the resources, land and tools. They exploit the proletariat by paying them less than their work is worth.
*[[w:Capitalism|Capitalism]]: an economic system with private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit.

===Propositions===
Propositions are relationships proposed between the conceptual components of a theory.  Various proponents of conflict theory have delineated propositions based on the above assumptions.  Below are some of these propositions.

*Marx (1818-1883): The proletariat and bourgeoisie compete for control over scant resources. 
*Gumplowicz (1838-1909): Societies evolve out of war and conquest resulting in the development of nation-states and unequal systems with master and slave relationships. &lt;ref name=&quot;Adamek 2006&quot;&gt; Adamek, W., &amp; Radwan-Pragłowski, J. (2006). Ludwik Gumplowicz. Journal of Classical Sociology, 6(3), 381-398.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Weber (1864-1920): The [[w:Protestant Ethic|Protestant Ethic]] promoted hard work, creating an environment in which a capitalistic struggle for resources would thrive.
*Mills (1916-1962): Conflict exists between people of lower social statuses and the &quot;Power Elite&quot; (those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy) resulting in a struggle for resources and unequal distribution of influence. 
*Feminine Conflict Theory: Historically oppressed, women struggle to gain equal access to power and resources from men. 
*Postcolonialism: In an effort to increase their wealth, more powerful countries spread around the world. 
*World Systems Theory: Countries compete with each other for status, wealth, and technology. Countries are divided into core countries, semi-periphery countries, and periphery countries, which are, respectively, arranged in a social hierarchy with the core countries at the top and the periphery countries at the bottom.  Core countries extract resources from the semi-periphery and periphery countries and use their technology to turn those resources into consumer goods, which they can then sell back to people in the peripheral countries.

==History of Conflict Theory==
The ideas that make up the foundations of conflict theory can be traced back to early philosophy. [[w:Han Fei Tzu|Han Fei Tzu]] (280 - 233 BC) and other ancient Chinese philosophers taught that men are innately weak and lazy. This assumption leads to the obvious conclusion that the only way men can be controlled, then, is through punishment.  Those who have the power to punish can control society, as the fear of the power of punishment keeps men in check.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale2010&quot;&gt;Martindale, Don. 2010. The Nature and Types of Sociological Theory. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Polybius|Polybius]], a Greek philosopher (205-125 BC), focused his studies on the [[w:Roman Republic|Roman Republic]]. He believed that people were like herds of animals. Weaknesses lead man to form communities in which the strongest and bravest person became the leader. He believed societies change and transition into a monarchy and that monarchies are based on justice and legitimate authority. Monarchies have an obligation to keep peace in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale2010&quot;/&gt;  However, the same problems with men will be exhibited in their kings, leading to corrupt and unjust monarchies.  The result: [[w:tyrant|tyrants]] and tyranny. Tyranny is, however, self-limiting.  Once it becomes unbearable, the elite in society will figure out ways to over throw the monarchy. Society will be in support of these new leaders because they give more liberty and equality.  This cycle will repeat itself because the new leader will take some of the liberty and sense of equality away from the people. Polybius believed the only way to stop this cycle is to form a government that combines the best elements from monarchies, aristocracies, and democracy, like the Roman government during his time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale2010&quot;/&gt;

Many philosophers had similar ideas about conflict and society.{{fact}}  They believed that conflict was a necessary part of society.{{fact}} Conflict, as a sociological theory, was formalized in the 19th and 20th Centuries, building upon the ideas of people like those mentioned above. Many sociologists have contributed to the development of conflict theory, including [[w:Max Gluckman|Max Gluckman]], [[w:John Rex|John Rex]], [[w:Lewis A. Coser|Lewis A. Coser]], [[w:Randall Collins|Randall Collins]], [[w:Ralf Dahrendorf|Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[w:Ludwig Gumplovicz|Ludwig Gumplovicz]], [[w:Vilfredo Pareto|Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[w:Georg Simmel|Georg Simmel]].  However, [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] is often credited as being the father of conflict theory. 

Karl Heinrich Marx (1818 – 1883) was a German philosopher, sociologist, historian, political economist, political theorist and revolutionary socialist, who developed the socio-political theory of Marxism. His ideas have since played a significant role in both the development of social science and also in the socialist political movement. He published various books during his lifetime, with the most notable being The Communist Manifesto (1848) and Capital (1867–1894), many of which were co-written with his friend, the fellow German revolutionary socialist [[w:Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels]]. Marx’s dedication to social change led him to focus most of his work on revolutionary class conflicts in industrial societies. Karl Marx died a poor man but his work and ideas have influenced the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;Wolff, Jonathan. n.d. “Karl Marx.” http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ (Accessed April 29, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx saw conflict as primarily resulting from class conflicts within industry and the economic segment of society.  [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] (1864-1920) proposed that power, prestige and property also added to social conflict and that such conflict was found in all aspects of society (e.g., politics, gender, and religion).

[[w:C. Wright Mills|C. Wright Mills]] (1916-1962) also contributed to modern conflict theory. According to Mills, one of the results of conflict between people with competing interests and resources is the creation of a social structure. Social structure refers to the relatively fixed institutions and norms of society that heavily influence, consciously or not, peoples' everyday behavior (e.g., getting your license at a department of motor vehicles reflects the fact that social structure dictates who gets to grant licenses, how, when, and to whom).  However, control over the social structure is largely in the hands of the elite (wealthy), who generally oppose the interests of the non-elite.

== Modern Examples ==
=== Social Stratification ===
As civilizations undergo change from agrarian, rural groups into industrialized, modern societies, a social hierarchy emerges that effectively creates distinct classes based on wealth, power and prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrante 2005&quot;&gt; Ferrante, J. (2005). &quot;Sociology: A Global Perspective.&quot; Wadsworth Publishing; 6 edition. &lt;/ref&gt;  According to conflict theory, it is this structure of social stratification that pits those in the upper class (i.e., those with the most power, wealth and prestige) against the lower classes.

Conflict theory also asserts that modern society and the &quot;...criminal justice system and criminal law...operates on the behalf of the rich and powerful social elites, with the resulting policies aimed at controlling the poor,&quot;{{fact|page number?}} thus perpetuating a system in which the upper class maintains power and all other classes remain economically disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and nearly powerless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek 2005&quot;&gt; Greek, C. (2005). &quot;Conflict Theory in Criminology.&quot; URL: http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/conflict.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  Marx foresaw such conflicts, asserting that &quot;...every society has been based... on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes,&quot; with modernization and industrialization significantly increasing this conflict and the oppression of the lower classes by the upper class&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx Engles 1848&quot;&gt; Marx, K; Engels, F. (1948). “Manifesto of the Communist Party.” Progress Publishers: Moscow 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern society presents several examples of the main ideas and mechanisms of conflict theory in practice, showing the process by which the upper class power elites systematically work to disenfranchise and exploit the lower classes to maintain and increase their power.&lt;ref name=Mills 1956&quot;&gt; Mills, C.W. (1956). “The Power Elite.” Oxford University Press, USA. &lt;/ref&gt;  Interestingly, conflict theory does not apply only to one type of government or society; it can be applied to democracies, socialist nations and dictatorships alike.

=== Wealth and Power Inequality ===
While the United States is purportedly a nation that is values principles of equality, egalitarianism, meritocracy, hard work, and the pursuit of the &quot;American Dream,&quot; the U.S. also has a very high level of economic and social inequality.  Domhoff (2011) provides striking evidence of this inequality, finding that &quot;as of 2007, the top 1% of households (the upper class) owned 34.6% of all privately held wealth, and the next 19% (the managerial, professional, and small business stratum) had 50.5%.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Domoff 2011&quot;&gt; Domhoff, G.W. (2011). “Power in America: Wealth, Income and Power.” URL: http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to state that this means that the top 20% of Americans own 85% of the nation’s wealth as a whole, with the other 80% of Americans having only 15% of the wealth.  This extreme inequality in the level of power and wealth that currently exist in the United States exemplifies the central themes of conflict theory, namely that there is a competition for power between classes.  The implications of this large disparity in wealth between social classes in the United States includes many disadvantages for those in the lower classes, such as a lack of access to quality health care, increased risk of violent crime, fewer educational opportunities (especially post-secondary education), and the absence of a social network to provide opportunities for upward mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lareau 2003&quot;&gt; Lareau, A. (2003). &quot;Unequal Childhoods.&quot; U. California Press. Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug Abuse and Crime ===
Proponents of conflict theory argue that crime and criminal justice in the modern world is designed to benefit the upper, powerful classes, while subjugating and disenfranchising the lower classes.  Greek (2005) provides an excellent explanation of this phenomenon:

:&quot;Thus, street crimes, even minor monetary ones are routinely punished quite severely, while large scale financial and business crimes are treated much more leniently. Theft of a television might receive a longer sentence than stealing millions through illegal business practices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek 2005&quot;/&gt;

This example illustrates the manner in which conflict theory can be applied to deviance in society as the upper classes seek to maintain their position and power by ensuring that the lower classes remain poor and relatively powerless.

Conflict theory has also been applied to the current trends of drug abuse in the United States, finding that societal and social class position effect one's rate of drug abuse.  More specifically, &quot;Conflict theory holds that there are higher numbers of chronic drug abusers found in lower social classes, disorganized neighborhoods. lower income families, and relatively politically powerless places.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lo2003&quot;&gt; Lo, C. C. (2003). An Application of Social Conflict Theory to Arrestees' Use of Cocaine and Opiates. Journal of Drug Issues, 33(1), 237-266.&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|page number?}}  Lo (2003) found that, in accordance with conflict theory, social environments negatively effect inequality &quot;...widespread poverty and severe social disorganization, lacking legitimate opportunities as well as adequate education
and training, have a [strong] association with opiate and cocaine use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lo2003&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This approach stands in contrast to the strict behaviorism of psychological theories prevalent at the time it was first formulated (in the 1920s and 1930s),  [[w:behaviorism|behaviorism]] and [[w:ethology|ethology]], and also contrasts with [[w:functionalism|structural-functionalism]].  According to Symbolic Interactionism, humans are distinct from infrahumans (lower animals)simply respond to their environment (i.e., a stimulus evokes a response or stimulus -&gt; response) whereas humans have the ability to interrupt that process (i.e., stimulus -&gt; cognition -&gt; response).  Additionally, infrahumans are unable to conceive of alternative responses to gestures. Humans, however, can.  This understanding should not be taken to indicate that humans never behave in a strict ''stimulus -&gt; response'' fashion, but rather that humans have the capability of not responding in that fashion (and do so much of the time).

This perspective is also rooted in phenomenological thought (see [[w:social constructionism|social constructionism]] and [[w:phenomenology|phenomonology]].  According to symbolic interactionism, the objective world has no reality for humans, only subjectively-defined objects have meaning. Meanings are not entities that are bestowed on humans and learned by habituation. Instead, meanings can be altered through the creative capabilities of humans, and individuals may influence the many meanings that form their society (Herman and Reynolds 1994).  Human society, therefore, is a social product.

It should also be noted that symbolic interactionists advocate a particular methodology.  Because they see ''meaning'' as the fundamental component of human/society interaction, studying human/society interaction requires ''getting at'' that meaning.  Thus, symbolic interactionists tend to employ more [[w:qualitative|qualitative]] rather than [[w:quantitative|quantitative]] methods in their research.

==Additional Concepts==
===Society===
In symbolic interactionist thought, there is a difference between infrahuman and human society.  In infrahuman life, cooperation is physiologically determined.  In other words, it is not a cognitive process; it results from instinct and biological programming rather than conscious thinking.  In human society, cooperation is cognitive and conscious.  Human cooperation can only be brought about by:
*each acting individual ascertaining the intention of the acts of others
*each acting individual deciding on his/her own response on the basis of that intention

Another distinction drawn between infrahumans and humans is in the types of communication employed.  Infrahuman communication is gestural; it takes place immediately, without any interruption of the act for interpretation or assigning meaning.  In contrast to infrahuman communication, human communication is meaningful in that gestures are symbolic and do not invoke immediate responses - humans must interpret gestures and assign them meaning.  Because human communication involves interpretation and the assignment of meaning, it is only possible when there is consensus in meaning.  Meanings for symbols must be shared. 

Shared meaning necessarily takes place through role-taking; in order to complete an act, the actor must put himself in the position of the other person. Behavior is viewed as ''social'' not simply when it is a response to others, but rather when it has incorporated in it the behavior of others. Human beings respond to themselves as other persons respond to them, and in so doing they imaginatively share the conduct of others.

===Self===
The '''self''' refers to the conscious, reflective personality of an individual. It is the entity the person envisions when he/she thinks about who they are. In order to understand the concept of self, it is important to understand that the development of self is only possible through [[w:role|role-taking]].  In order to look upon your ''self'', you have to be able to take the role of another, which, in turn, allows you to reflect upon your ''self''.  Because role-taking is a necessary part of self-development, it is concurrent with the development of self.

According to Mead (1967), the self develops in a series of three stages:
#preparatory stage - meaningless imitation by the infant
#play stage - actual playing of roles occurs; but no unified conception of self develops
#game stage - this is the completion stage of self-development; the child finds who he or she is; the child also must respond to simultaneous roles; the individual can act with a certain amount of consistency in a variety of situations because he/she acts in accordance with a generalized set of expectations and definitions he/she has internalized

The ''self'' consists of two parts, the ''I'' and the ''Me''.  The ''I'' is the impulsive tendency of the individual (similar to Freud's notion of the [[w:Id|Id]]).  The ''I'' is the spontaneous, unorganized aspect of human existence. The ''Me'' is the incorporated other (see [[w:generalized other|generalized other]]) within the individual.  The incorporated or generalized other supplies an organized set of attitudes and definitions, understandings and expectations (or [[w:meaning|meanings]]) that are common to the group to which the individual belongs (similar to Freud's concept of the [[w:superego|superego]]).

According to Mead's presentation of the ''I'' and the ''Me'', action begins in the form of the ''I'' and ends in the form of the ''Me''; the ''I'' gives propulsion while the ''Me'' gives direction.  Additionally, the ''I'', being creative and spontaneous, provides for change in society.  The ''Me'', being regulatory, works to maintain society.  Thus, in the concept of ''self'' is a powerful and comprehensive understanding of how humans function in society and, in turn, how society functions (by both changing and remaining constant).  The concept also depicts the relationship between the individual and society (Meltzer 1978).

According to Meltzer (1978), there are three implications of selfhood:
#the possession of self makes of the individual a society in miniature; humans can engage themselves in interaction; they can view themselves in a new way
#the ability to act toward oneself makes possible an inner experience which need not reach overt expression; humans can have a mental life
#an individual with a self can direct and control his behavior

It is also important to recognize that the self and the mind are twin emergents in the social process...

===Mind===
The ''Mind'' or mental component of man emerges out of human communication.  The mind is only present when significant symbols (as opposed to gestures that do not have meaning but simply evoke responses) are being used in communication. In this sense, ''mind'' is a process manifested whenever the individual is interacting with himself using significant symbols (symbols or gestures with interpretations or meanings).

The mind is also the component of the individual that interrupts responses to stimuli.  It is the mind that attempts to pre-vision the future by exploring possible outcomes of actions before proceeding with actions. In minded behavior, the individual carries on an internal conversation.

==Notes==
The basic assumptions of symbolic interactionism, according to Herman and Reynolds (1994), are:
#humans live in a symbolic world of learned meanings
#symbols arise in the social process and are shared
#symbols have motivational significance; meaning and symbols allow individuals to carry out distinctively human action and interaction
#the mind is a functional, volitional, teleological entity serving the interests of the individual; Humans, unlike the lower animals, are endowed with the capacity for thought; the capacity for thought is shaped by social interaction
#the self is a social construct; just as individuals are born mindless, so too, are they born selfless; our selves arise in social interaction with others
#society is a linguistic or symbolic construct arising out of the social process; it consists of individuals interacting
#sympathetic introspection is a mandatory mode of inquiry

==Introduction==
Stratification affects our everyday lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;&gt;Hurst, E., 2010. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2007&quot;&gt;Roberts, K., 2007. Our Social World. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of people in a society.  This chapter focuses on economic stratification; meaning how people are differentiated based upon their wealth (and/or power). Sociology has a long history of studying stratification and teaching about various kinds of inequality, including economic inequality, racial/ethnic inequality, gender inequality, and other types of inequality. Inequality means people have unequal access to scarce and valued resources in society.  These resources might be economic or political, such as health care, education, jobs, property and land ownership, housing, and ability to influence government policy. 

Statistics on United States and global inequality are widespread and alarming.  Consider this:  
*Just 400 Americans have the same wealth as half of all Americans combined&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2011&quot;&gt;Moore, M., 2011. America is NOT broke. [Online]. Available at: www.truth-out.org/michael-moore-america-is-not-broke68265 [accessed August 26, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Just 25 Americans have a combined income almost as great as the combined income of 2 billion of the world’s poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sernau2005&quot;&gt;Sernau, S., 2005. Worlds apart: social inequalities in a global economy. Newbury Park: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007, more than 37 million U.S. citizens, or 12.5 percent of the population, were classified as poor by the Census Bureau.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;
*In 2007, CEO’s in the fortune 500 received an average of $10.5 million, 344 times the pay of the average worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;
*Four of the wealthiest people in the world come from one family, the Walton’s.  They are the four children who inherited Sam Walton’s company Wal-Mart.  Together, they are worth $83.6 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aulette2011&quot;&gt;Aulette, J.R. &amp; Wittner, J., 2011. Gendered Worlds, 2nd edition. New York: Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Half of American children will reside in a household that uses food stamps at some point during childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rank2011&quot;&gt;Rank, M., 2011. Rethinking American poverty. Contexts, 10 (2), 16-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life expectancy in Harlem is shorter than in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rank2011&quot;/&gt;

Although inequality is everywhere, there are many controversies and questions about inequality that sociologists are interested in such as where did inequality come from? Why does it continue?  Do we justify inequality?  Can we eliminate inequality?  Can we make a society in which people are equal?  Before answering these complex questions, we will broadly define socioeconomic status and social class in America.  The chapter then turns to dominant theories on stratification, and explores class, race, and gender inequality in more detail.  We look at how capitalism is an important context in inequality.  We end with consequences of inequality and theories explaining global inequality.

==Socioeconomic Status==
Building on the ideas of Max Weber, who saw three main dimensions of stratification (class, status, and party), contemporary sociologists often define stratification in terms of socioeconomic status (or SES).  There are a variety of ways to measure SES, including educational attainment, income, wealth, and occupational prestige.  These measures reflect three characteristics of individuals: power, property, and prestige.  These three characteristics combine to indicate someone’s social class or socioeconomic status.

===Power===
Power refers to someone’s ability to get others to do his/her will, regardless of whether or not they want to.  Legitimate power, power given to individuals willingly by others, is called authority.  Illegitimate power, power taken by force or the threat of force, is called coercion.

===Property===
Property, as used in this context, refers to the sum total of one’s possessions as well as their regular income.  Property goes beyond income as a measure of social class as it reflects the accumulated wealth (e.g., homes, stocks, bonds, savings and how many children you have) in addition to one’s earning potential.  Property is a better overall measure of social class than income as many individuals who are considered wealthy actually have very small incomes.

===Prestige===
Prestige refers to the reputation or esteem associated with one’s position in society.  Prestige used to be associated with one's family name, but for most people in developed countries, prestige is now generally tied to one's occupation.  Occupations like physicians or lawyers tend to have more prestige associated with them than occupations like bartender or janitor.  An individual’s prestige is closely tied to their social class – the higher the prestige of an individual (through their occupation or maybe family name), the higher the social class.

These three indicators tend to go hand-in-hand or lead to each other, such as a Supreme Court justice who is usually wealthy, enjoys a great deal of prestige, and exercises significant power.  In some cases, however, a person ranks differently on these indicators, such as funeral directors.  Their prestige is fairly low, but most have higher incomes than college professors, who are among the most educated people in America and have high prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;&gt;Benokraitis, N., 2010. SOC, 2nd edition. Belmont: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social class in America==
[[Image:PovertyratesinUS1959-2003.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]

[[Image:Povertythresholds-census2003.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]

Sociologists Dennis Gilbert and Joseph Kahl developed a model of the American class social class structure.  Briefly, the upper class in America (3% of the population) is divided into upper-upper class (1% of the U.S. population), earning hundreds of millions to billions in income per year while the lower-upper class (2%) earns millions in annual income.  The middle class (40%) is divided into upper-middle class (14%) earning $76,000 or more per year while the lower-middle class (26%) earns $46,000 to $75,000.  The working class (30%) earns $19,000 to $45,000.  The lower class (27%) is divided into working poor (13%, earning $9000 to 18,000) and underclass (14%, earning under $9000).&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;

Among America’s working class and working poor are hotel housekeepers, waitresses, house maids, and retail clerks.  In ''Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America'', Barbara Ehrenreich describes her experience of working a series of low-wage jobs in 1998 and trying to survive on her wages.  Among other low-wage jobs, she worked in Wal-Mart, earning $6.00 per hour.  In addition to trying to survive on her wages, she described how working overtime without pay was the custom at Wal-Mart.  Managers informed workers to punch out of the time clock and to begin some additional work (without pay).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenreich2002&quot;&gt;Ehrenreich, B., 2002. Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. New York: Henry Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[w:Great Recession|Great Recession]] from 2007-2009, the gap between the rich and poor has increased in America.  Today, the richest one percent of Americans earn nearly a quarter of the country’s income and control 40 percent of its wealth.  The gap between the wealth of white families and the wealth of African-American families and Hispanics has also increased.  The average wealth of a white family in 2009 was 20 times greater than that of the average black family, and 18 times greater than the average Hispanic family.  In other words, the average white family had $113,149 in net worth, compared to $6,325 for Hispanics and $5,677 for African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rakesh2011&quot;&gt;Rakesh K., Fry, R., &amp; Taylor, P., 2011. Wealth Gaps Rise to Record Highs Between Whites, Blacks, Hispanics. [Online].

Let’s take a step back now and see where inequality really began.

===Origins of Inequality and private property===
The origins of inequality can be found in the transition from hunter/gatherer societies to horticultural/pastoralist societies.  Here, it might be useful to describe a few characteristics of these societies.

In hunter/gather societies, (around 50,000 B.C.), small groups of people gathered what they could find and they also hunted and fished.  People grew and collected their food for all of their needs.  There was very little trading between the groups and there were not many inequalities between groups.  There was not a surplus of goods.  Everyone possessed basically the same as everyone else.  The division of labor was small.  People did almost the same jobs as each other.  Food gathering and food production was the focus of work.  

In horticultural/pastoralist societies (around 12,000 B.C.), groups grew to be very large and humans settled down in one place.  For the first time, people had more time to do other work besides producing food, such as making leather and making weapons and other special skills.  This new division of labor led to surplus of goods.  The groups then traded with each other.  This led to inequality because some people accumulated more possessions than others.    

Fast forward many millennia later to just before Industrialization began.  In the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, there was collectivity in the space and land in Europe.  Life was brutal and harsh, but there was a joint and shared responsibility in the way people lived their lives and went about their work.  People farmed land in a collective way because they saw it as something for everyone to take care of and for everyone to enjoy the fruits of their labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Achbar2004&quot;&gt;Achbar, M., Abbott J., &amp; Bakan J., 2004. The Corporation. Zeitgeist Video.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of private taking and private property began to flourish in the late 15th century beginning in Europe and spreading around the world.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau linked private property with inequality in his book, ''Discourse on Inequality''.  Collective land and space, once shared by all, began to be divided up into private takings and private ownership (and this continues today).  Land, oceans, and air, once shared by everyone in the world, began being bought and sold like products in a store.  The great land masses of the world were reduced to private property.  Laws and regulations were created that allowed a country to claim a certain amount of water for exploitation.  Air was divided into air corridors that were bought and sold for commercial traffic for airplanes.  Today, the right to private property is an important value in most societies.  With deregulation, privatization, and free trade, we continue to see a private taking and private ownership of entities once shared by everyone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Achbar2004&quot;/&gt;

The idea that there should be equality in society emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries in the writings of Hobbes and Locke.  Their thinking helped people consider that inequality was the result of the actions and intentions of social institutions and specific groups and not the will of God.  Even so, the question of the origin of inequality remains today in addition to why inequality continues. 

===The persistence of inequality===
Sociologist Joel Charon&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;&gt;Charon, J., 2007. 10 questions. A Sociological Perspective, 6th edition. Belmont:  Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; offers a few reasons why inequality continues in society.  His arguments reflect social reproduction theory, which focuses on the roles of institutions and cultures in the perpetuation of inequality and the process by which the social class structure is maintained.  First, the rich and powerful protect the system of inequality.  They are typically the owners of the means of production (factories, machinery, land, transportation) and have the resources to protect themselves and their positions.  This control is heightened in societies with advanced technology as more developed technology facilitates the ability of the wealthy to pass on their wealth to their offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulder2009&quot;&gt;Mulder, Monique Borgerhoff et al. 2009. “Intergenerational Wealth Transmission and the Dynamics of Inequality in Small-Scale Societies.” Science 326(5953):682–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in modern societies, the transition of wealth is basically as simple as changing the names on the bank accounts or transferring stock from parents to children, which can be done at the push of a button. But in less developed economies - like hunter-gatherer or pastoralist - the transmission of wealth is far more difficult as it involves the physical transferring of goods.  Thus, technology has the potential to substantially heighten inequality by facilitating the intergenerational transmission of wealth.

Karl Marx argued that the rich and powerful have control over the means of production, which is economic power, and they also have great influence on government power, including the rules governments follow, the people who work for the government, and the laws governments make.  The rich and powerful also have control over the media, the schools, the courts, and many other parts of society and they support institutions (religion, economy, and education) that favor them.  For example, the Walton family made $3.2 million in political contributions in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;&gt;Wal-Mart-the high cost of low price, 2005. Brave new films.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Waltons have great economic power and also the ability to influence government through large donations to political actors that protect their positions and their businesses.  Inequality continues because those at the top protect their positions and use their power to influence other parts of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;

Second, culture teaches the acceptance of inequality.  Research shows that Americans believe in equality.  Research also shows that Americans view inequality as justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;  One belief system that people commonly embrace--mistakenly, according to contemporary economic research-- is that the rich and powerful are more talented, hardworking, and intellectually superior and thus more deserving.  The poor are poor because they are lazy or irresponsible or unmotivated.  If they can’t make it, it is their fault.  These are ideologies that protect the system of inequality.  These ideologies legitimatize the position of the rich and powerful and explain and justify the position of the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;&gt;Johnson, A. 2006. Privilege, Power, and Difference, 2nd edition. Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to accept inequality, not because they are happy with their situation, but because over time people believe their situation is natural and normal and it is what they expect from life. 

In the United States, important cultural values are taught early on which support the system of inequality.  These include a focus on the individual, a value of hard work, measurable achievement, and the ‘sacred’ ideal of equal opportunity.  People accept as truth these beliefs: ‘If you work hard, you can rise to the top.’ ‘You can be anything you want to be.’ ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way.’ ‘America is the land of opportunity; anyone can make it if they try hard enough.’ ‘Work hard, get an education, and don’t give up when the going gets rough.’  These values support the inequality that already exists and these values deny the impacts of inequality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

The American dream contains the belief that every individual can achieve prosperity and success through hard work and self discipline.  For example, U.S. President Barack Obama said in a speech in 2005, “…whether chance of birth or circumstance decides life’s big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, at the very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama2005&quot;&gt;Obama, B., 2005. [Online]. Available at http://www.notable-quotes.com/o/obama_barack.html [accessed August 1, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;  While these might be inspirational words, they focus on the individual and leave out the social structural causes of inequality and poverty, such as the high unemployment rate, inheritance laws that allow families to pass on wealth, lack of state supported child care or health care, and tax policies that favor the wealthy.  As a startling example, the Walton family received a federal tax cut of $91,500 per hour during the 2004 tax year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;/&gt;

Third, people are socialized to accept their position in life.  The rich and powerful socialize their children to expect wealth and power.  Parents, teachers, and friends show us our position in society and teach us to expect that same level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt; Parents who attended prestigious boarding schools and Ivy League colleges such as Harvard, Yale, or Princeton expect their future offspring will attend such schools.  Harvard researcher Michael Hurwitz found that legacy students were 45% more likely to be admitted to elite colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurwitz2011&quot;&gt;Huwitz, Michael. 2011. Legacy students up to 45% more likely to be admitted to elite colleges. [Online]. Available at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/06/legacy-students-45-percen_n_805272.html [accessed August 1, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivy League colleges, private country clubs, debutante balls (a formal introduction and presentation of young women to society) and the social register (a book listing the most important and famous American families) are ways that the wealthy maintain their cohesion and pass on their prestigious positions to their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higley2003&quot;&gt;Higley, S., 2003. The U.S. Upper Class. In J. Henslin, ed. Down to Earth Sociology,12th edition. New York: The Free Press. 347-359.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, education helps to reinforce an acceptance of inequality and education prepares each social class differently, depending on the roles they will play when leaving school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;  This means teaching the appropriate skills but also the appropriate values for each social class.  Elementary and high schools in the U.S., in particular, teach different values to different social classes.  Working-class students learn obedience; upper-middle class students learn leadership and creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;  Upper-middle class students participate in activities that focus on public performance and skill development.  Working-class students participate in informal play, visiting family, and ‘hanging out.’&lt;ref name=&quot;Lareau2000&quot;&gt;Lareau, A., 2000. Social class and the daily lives of children: a study from the United States. Childhood, 7 (2), 155-171.&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization brings the acceptance of a culture that justifies inequality, and it normally brings an acceptance of one’s relative position in the system of inequality.

Finally, police, courts, and prisons work together to protect the system of inequality.  Research has shown that the criminal justice system in the U.S. is biased against the poor from start to finish, from the definition of what constitutes a crime through the process of arrest, trial, and sentencing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiman2006&quot;&gt;Reiman, J., 2006. The rich get richer and the poor get prison: ideology, class, and criminal justice, 8th edition. London: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of society seems to encourage and protect the system of inequality.  Given all of these ways inequality is perpetuated in a society, is it at all possible to eliminate it?

===Can we eliminate inequality?===
Inequality and poverty didn’t just drop down from the sky, like an apple does from a tree. The previous section shows it is embedded in society in many ways, but if the conditions that generate social inequality are conscious and intentional creations of human actions, they can be changed.  We will examine this complex issue in the next section.

==Dominant Perspectives==
Two classic approaches to stratification provide interesting insights into this phenomenon, structural-functionalism and conflict theories.  

===Structural-Functionalism on stratification===
The structural-functional approach to stratification asks the same question that it does of the other components of society:  What function or purpose does it serve?  The answer is that all parts of society, even poverty, contribute in some way to the larger system’s overall stability, according to this theory.  Stratification and inequalities are inevitable and beneficial to society.  The layers (stratification) are the inevitable sorting of unequal people.  The layering is useful because it ensures that the best people are at the top and those who are less worthy are further down the pyramid and therefore have less power and are given fewer rewards than the high quality people at the top.  Inequality ensures that the most functionally important jobs are filled by the best qualified people.  In other words, it makes sense for the CEO of a company whose position is more important functionally to make more money than a janitor working for the same company.  A job’s functional importance is determined by the degree to which the job is unique, meaning whether few other people can perform the same function adequately.  Garbage collectors are important to public sanitation, but do not need to be rewarded highly, because little training or talent is required to perform their job.  Doctors should be rewarded highly, because great training is required to do their job.  It is logical that society must offer greater rewards (e.g., income, vacations, promotion) to motivate the most qualified people to fill the most important positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;

There are several obvious problems with this approach to stratification.  First, it is difficult to determine the functional importance of any job, as the accompanying specialization and inter-dependence make every position necessary to the overall operation.  The engineers in a factory for example are just as important as the other workers in the factory to the success of a project.  In another example, a primary school teacher in the U.S. earns $29,000 per year whereas a National Basketball Association Player can earn as much as $21 million per year.  Are basketball players more essential to society than teachers?  Are basketball players more functionally important than teachers?  In 2009, comedian Jerry Seinfeld earned $85 million.  Do his earnings demonstrate his contribution to society?  If NBA players or famous comedians went on strike and decided not to work, most people would not notice.  However, if teachers, bus drivers, nurses, cleaners, garbage collectors, or waitresses stopped working, society would close down.  There is little connection between income and jobs that are functionally important in a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;

Second, this approach assumes that the system of stratification is fair and rational, and that the ‘best’ people end up on top because of their superiority.  But, in real life, the system does not work so easily or perfectly.  Former U.S. president [[w:George W. Bush|George W. Bush]], for example, was not the smartest or most politically talented individual but he was well connected and born at the top of the stratification system (white, male, wealthy, American), and therefore was elected to a position with great power – the U.S. presidency.  

Another problem with this approach is that it assumes that only a few ‘chosen’ people should have all the power and all the material wealth, rather than distributing it equitably, or distributing it to those who need it most.

===Conflict Theorists on stratification===
Conflict theorists argue that stratification is dysfunctional and harmful in society.  Stratification benefits the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor.  For example, many wealthy families pay low wages to nannies to care for their children, gardeners to attend to their rose gardens and maids to pick up their dirty socks.  Capitalism, in particular, benefits the rich.  Corporate welfare is one example where an arrangement of direct subsidies, tax breaks, and other support that the government has created for big businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt; As mentioned previously, the Walton family receives enormous tax breaks.  Inequality is inevitable within a system that has individual competition at its core, and therefore, ‘winners’ and ‘losers.’  Conflict theorists believe that this competitive system, together with the way the game is ‘fixed’, ends up creating and perpetuating stratification systems.  Competition and inequality are not inevitable but are created and maintained by people.  

Functionalists criticize this approach by arguing that people do not always act largely out of economic self-interest.  For example, Chuck Feeney, the creator of Duty Free Shoppers, has given $4 billion to charities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;  Bill Gates has given 58% of his wealth to charity.  In contrast, the Walton family has given less than 1% of their wealth to charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;/&gt; Functionalists also argue that conflict theorists underestimate people’s ability to move upward in society.  They argue that if people really want to succeed, they can do so through hard work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;

===Can we make a society in which people are equal?===
Societies could be redesigned so that they are based on cooperation.  [[w:Marxists|Marxists]] argue that a central component of a more equitable and humane society would be based on the idea, “from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.”  In other words, each person should produce or work to the best of their ability according to their talents, and each person should receive the fruits of this labor according to their need, irrespective of what they have produced.  Conflict theorists also believe that democracy or some sort of group decision making is more humane and more effective.  Stratification systems that concentrate decision making and power in the hands of a few are destined to not serve the interests of most people at the bottom of the pyramid.

==Intersections of Class, Race, and Gender==


[[Image:Poorestquintilebysurvivingondollar.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]

Economic class, in conjunction with race and gender, shape the opportunities, the privileges, and the inequalities experienced for individuals and groups.  The United States continues to be greatly stratified along these three lines.  This was seen when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005.  In New Orleans, the roles of class, race, and gender were made apparent to the U.S. public.  Many of the televised images showed poor, African Americans, many who were women and their children, abandoned in the storm, without resources for several days and without basic necessities of food and water.  Though the storm displaced hundreds of people from all backgrounds, classes, colors and gender ‘equally,’ all were not affected the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersen2007&quot;&gt;Andersen, M., &amp; Collins, P.H., 2007. Why race, class, and gender still matter. In M. Andersen &amp; P.H. Collins, eds. Race, Class and Gender. An Anthology, 6th edition. Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy had cars to leave New Orleans, and credit cards and bank accounts for emergency hotels and supplies.  They also had insurance policies for rebuilding.  The unequal impact of this tragedy was not unique.  In the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 for example, 60% of first class passengers survived, while only 24% of third class passengers survived.  One child in first class died, while 49 children in third class died.  The poor in the U.S. and around the world are most likely to suffer from ‘natural’ and human tragedies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman2008&quot;&gt;Bowman, J., 2008. Guided Fantasy: The Titanic Game. In K. McKinney &amp; B. Heyl, eds. Sociology through active learning: student exercises. Newbury Park: Pine Forge Press. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Titanic2011&quot;&gt;The Titanic Page. [Online]. Available at: http://www.eszlinger.com/titanic/titanfacts.html [accessed September 10, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitalism, class, privilege, and oppression==
Class plays an important role in the forms of privilege and oppression.  Capitalism produces enormous amounts of wealth, in addition to increasing levels of inequality, both within the U.S. and around the world. These inequalities result from a class system based on increasing gaps in income, wealth, and power between the few people on top and the masses of people at the bottom.  Capitalism is a system that produces cruel consequences.  For those at the bottom, the costs are great, with living conditions among the poor comparable to those found in developing countries.  Capitalism causes competition, stress, and anxiety among members of the working class and middle class, as people do not have any control over their work and whether they can keep their jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;  Despite the myth that hard work leads to getting ahead and making it, for the most part people have little power to improve their class position.  Research shows people are as likely to move downward as they are upward in the class system.  Currently, corporate downsizing, the loss of industrial jobs going overseas, the expansion of low-paying service occupations, and the Great Recession beginning in 2007, have combined to result in many people struggling to keep the jobs that they have, rather than being able to move upward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

==Capitalism, race and gender inequality==
The increase of immigrants in the U.S. and the loss of jobs to other countries illustrate a core belief that the greatest problem American workers experience is unfair competition from immigrants in the U.S. and workers abroad.  The belief, ‘they are taking our jobs’ ignores the capitalist system itself, which by its nature increases the wealth of the few owners by controlling workers and keeping wages as low as possible, and it allows a few owners to control the majority of wealth, leaving a tiny share to be distributed among everyone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

Capitalism also takes advantage of gender inequality.  Women workers are exploited for cheap labor as nannies and maids in New York, in clothing sweatshops in Los Angeles, and on rose farms in Ethiopia which pay women a dollar a day.  Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, in particular has been accused of discrimination against women.  Although over seventy percent of Wal-Mart’s hourly workers are female, they account for only a third of all management.  Wal-Mart has been sued for unfair practices in the training, payment, and promotion of its female employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt2001&quot;&gt;Hunt, J., 2001. Perspective: Barbara Ehrenreich on the Wal-Mart Suit. Time U.S. [Online]. Available at: http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,132362,00.html [accessed  September 8, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;  Capitalism would no longer function if the mass of women stopped doing the shopping, cooking, cleaning, and caretaking.  For the most part, women raise the next generation of workers on which capitalism depends.  Women do this work without receiving any extra pay or benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

==Points of View: Micro-Meso-Macro==
We now turn to three levels of analysis on stratification.  

===Micro-level prestige and influence===
Stratification occurs in small groups and face-to-face interaction.  At the beginning of the chapter, we looked at how stratification begins when we are young.  Clothing, expensive toys, a new bicycle, a fancy car, and what job our parents had were symbols that differentiated us and separated us in elementary schools and impacted which friends we played with and the interactions we had.  

Throughout our lives, wealth, power, and prestige are given to individuals who have knowledge and access to important information and influential people in society.  Gender and race influence our degrees of networks, as well as individual qualities of leadership, self confidence, and physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2007&quot;/&gt;  

===Meso-level access to resources===
Our positions and connections in organizations and institutions lie within the stratification system.  This impacts how we experience life and how we interact with other individuals and groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2007&quot;/&gt;  As mentioned earlier, parents, teachers, and friends show us our position in society and teach us to expect that same level.  Education prepares each social class differently, with different skills and values taught to each class.  The police, courts, and prisons reinforce the stratification system.  Our position in the system reflects the type of health care we receive.  All of these institutions support the stratification system by favoring the rich and powerful.  

===Macro-level factors influencing stratification===
Our position in the international economic system in the world shapes our opportunities throughout our life and our access to important resources.  Let’s look at Cape Verde as an example.  Located 450 kilometers off the coast of Senegal, West Africa, it is geographically and economically isolated from the rest of the world. (See Picture 1.)  About one quarter of the population remains unemployed and an additional 26 percent are underemployed.  The poverty rate in 2003 was 37 percent including 20 percent who are identified as extremely poor.  The country is ranked 38 in the Human Poverty Index by the United Nations.  Cape Verde is a debtor nation with a total external debt of $360 million at the end of 2002.  Besides being in debt to countries of the North, (the U.S. and Europe) Cape Verde is part of the global economy in other ways. The country’s major industries are owned by nations of the North.  Forty-nine percent of the banks, hotels, airlines and shipping lines formerly owned by the Cape Verdean government have been sold to foreign investors.  In addition, Portuguese investors own forty percent of the state telecommunications company.  The dominance of foreigner investors in even the industries that supply the most basic needs, such as water, are a result of policies of privatization, a key element of [[w:neoliberal|neoliberal]] and Washington Consensus economic “reforms.” (See Picture 2).  And the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] continues to push its privatization drive demanding that Cape Verde privatize its few remaining public enterprises, including the national airlines, the national oil supply company, the national transportation company, and others.  Both the country’s private sector business class and low-income households have been greatly impacted, experiencing job loss and price hikes.  On one island, the increased cost of privatized energy has forced people who cannot afford the electricity to return to traditional oil lamps.  Low-income women especially have been impacted from structural adjustment programs, which have cut governmental provisions on health, education, and food.  Macro level factors such as policies implemented by the World Bank and International Monetary fund impact the job opportunities, prices of food, water, and electricity, and day to day life for citizens in Cape Verde and around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2009&quot;&gt;Carter, K., &amp; Aulette, J., 2009. Cape Verdean women and globalization: the politics of gender, culture and resistance. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (See picture 3).

===Consequences of Inequality===
In the opening paragraph and throughout this chapter, we presented many consequences of inequality.  What class we belong to directly relates to our individual life chances.  Let’s look at a few more points in detail.  The wealthy and well-educated are much more likely to be in good health, and have access to good medical care than the poor.  The poor have shorter life expectancies and are at greater risk for chronic illnesses.  Children born into poor families are at much greater risk of dying during their first year of life from disease, accidents, or violence.  When medical attention is needed, its huge cost prevents the poor from seeking care.  For many, the high cost of insurance prevents Americans from having good medical care.  Approximately 45.7 million people in the United States were without health insurance coverage in 2007.  Hunger is also connected to class.  It is estimated that 13 percent of children under age 12 are hungry or at risk of being hungry.  Among the working poor, almost 75% of the children are thought to be in this category.  In addition to the high cost of food, the lack of affordable housing is a critical concern for poor families and many families live in weekly hotels which are cheaper than paying monthly rent.  In Orange County, California, low-income parents working full-time at Disneyland for $9 per hour still struggle to find affordable housing, so parents with young children live across the street in motels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelosi2010&quot;&gt;Pelosi, A., 2010. Homeless: The motel kids of Orange County.  HBO Summer Series. [Online]. Available at: http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/homeless-the-motel-kids-of-orange-county/index.html [accessed August 29, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2011&quot;&gt;Kendall, D., 2011. Sociology in our times, 8th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor are not able to provide the same educational opportunities for their children as the wealthy are.  School districts in wealthy suburban areas tend to pay higher teachers’ salaries, have newer buildings, and provide sophisticated equipment.  Students in central city schools and poverty stricken rural areas often attend rundown schools that lack necessary equipment and teaching materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Private tutors, SAT preparation courses, and charter schools allow children from wealthy families to gain entrance to elite colleges and find jobs more quickly after graduation.  And, as previously mentioned, their children have a good chance of attending the same elite college.  The cycle of wealth, power, and prestige continues.

Our final section explores global inequality.

==Global Inequality==  
[[File:Pic 4 ethiopian children.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Picture 4. Children enjoying traditional bread during a celebration in Ethiopia.]]
Almost half the world, over 3 billion people, lives on less than $2.50 a day.  78 percent of Ethiopians earn less than $2.00 a day. (See Pictures 4, 5, and 6).  86% of the population in Zambia lives in poverty while 4% of the population in Belgium lives in poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empowering2011&quot;&gt;Empowering women and men to end their own hunger.

Seeing Sociology: an Introduction. Belmont: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Why is there such a large gap between Zambia and Belgium?  Why are the poor still poor?  Who is to blame for poverty?  Social scientists offer a few theories which help to explain the causes and consequences of global inequality.

===Development and Modernization===
This theory blames tradition for global poverty.  These theorists argue poor societies stay poor because they hold onto traditional attitudes and beliefs, technologies and institutions, such as traditional economic systems and forms of government.  In contrast, in the modern world, the rise of capitalism brought modern attitudes, modern technologies such as machinery and electronics, and modern institutions which helped countries progress and have a higher standard of living.  Given enough time, modernization will occur everywhere in the world.  Eventually global capitalism and its modern corporations will hold these modern ideas, technical innovations, and efficient institutions everywhere.  Modernists believe large economic growth is the key to reducing poverty in poor countries.  

===Dependency===
[[File:Pic 5 ethiopia traditional houses.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Picture 5. Traditional huts near Wondo Genet, Ethiopia.]]
This theory blames colonialism and neocolonialism (continuing economic dependence on former colonial countries) for global poverty.  Countries have developed at an uneven rate because wealthy countries have exploited poor countries in the past and today through foreign debt and transnational corporations (TNCs).  Historically, wealthy nations have taken a great quantity of materials from poor countries such as minerals and metals necessary to make automobiles, weapons, and jewelry in wealthy countries.  In addition, large amounts of agricultural products that can only be grown in the hot climates of the poor countries have been taken and exported and manufactured in the wealthy countries such as coffee, tea, sugar, and cocoa.  Wealthy countries would not be as rich as they are today if they did not have these materials.  Also, wealthy countries increased their own profits by organizing cheap labor through slavery.  King Leopold II, for example, who was King of Belgium from 1865-1909, forced hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to work as slaves in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The invention of the bicycle tire in the 1890’s and later the automobile tire meant that rubber was in high demand, and wild rubber vines were widespread in the Congo, earning Leopold millions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genocide2011&quot;&gt;Genocide and crimes against humanity. [Online]. Available at: http://www.enotes.com/genocide-encyclopedia/king-leopold-ii-congo [accessed August 30, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Republic of Congo is still suffering today from the plunder of resources and the torture and killing of millions during Leopold’s rule.

Dependency theorists believe large economic growth is not necessarily the key to reducing poverty and developing.  Instead, poor countries are trapped by large debts which prevent them from developing.  For example, between 1970 and 2002, the continent of Africa received $540 billion in loans from wealthy nations and from the World Bank and IMF.  African countries have paid back $550 billion of their debt but they still owe $295 billion.  The difference, of course, is a result of compound interest.  Countries cannot focus on economic or human development when they are constantly paying off debt.  In addition, economic relationships between countries tend to benefit the wealthier countries.  Some of the land in Cape Verde for example, could be planted and harvested to feed people but is planted instead with cash crops for foreign exchange.  Due to indebtedness and foreign dependence, fresh produce is regularly sold or changed to a nonperishable type such as canned tuna for export rather than consumed by the population.  Widespread malnutrition is one of the effects of this foreign dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2009&quot;/&gt; This is common around the globe.  Brazil is the second largest exporter of agricultural products but 50% of its population is malnourished.  Although Ethiopia has one of the largest populations of cattle in Africa, and much of the population suffers from malnutrition, the government continues to export large numbers of cattle to the Middle East.  Even during the peak of the infamous 1985 famine, the government was sending dried meat to Egypt.  Sen and Grown&lt;ref name=&quot;Sen1987&quot;&gt;Sen, G. &amp; Grown, C., 1987. Development, crises, and alternative visions. New York: Monthly Review.&lt;/ref&gt; call this denationalizing of the Global South.  Foreign trade and business get in the way of the freedom of local governments.
 
===World Systems Theory===
[[File:Pic 6 ethiopia simple house.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Picture 6. A simple house in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.]]
This theory, similar to dependency theory, suggests that wealthy countries benefit from other countries and also exploit their citizens.  This reflects Immanuel Wallerstein’s theory that suggests that how a country is integrated into the capitalist world system is the key feature in determining how economic development takes place in that country.  The world economy is a system divided into a hierarchy of three types of countries: core, semiperipheral, and peripheral.  Core countries (e.g., U.S., Japan, Germany) are dominant capitalist countries characterized by high levels of industrialization and urbanization.  Semiperipheral countries (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa) are less developed than core nations but are more developed than peripheral nations.  Peripheral countries (e.g., most African countries and low income countries in South America) are dependent on core countries for capital, and have very little industrialization and urbanization.  Core countries own most of the world’s capital and technology and have great control over world trade and economic agreements.  Semiperipheral countries generally provide labor and materials to core countries.  Semiperipheral countries exploit peripheral countries, just as core countries exploit both semiperipheral and peripheral countries. Core countries extract raw materials with little cost.  They can also set the prices for the agricultural products that peripheral countries export regardless of market prices, forcing small farmers to abandon their fields because they can’t afford to pay the labor and fertilizer.  The wealthy in peripheral countries benefit from the labor of poor workers and from their own economic relations with core country capitalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2011&quot;/&gt;

===The New International Division of Labor theory===
Based on the changing nature of the world economy, production is divided into small pieces, each of which can be moved by a Transnational Corporation (TNC) to any country in the world that can provide the best deal on capital and labor.  When moving businesses and factories to cheap labor locations, effort is not made to create better quality of living and development projects in poor countries.  Strict laws protecting the environment and the rights of workers, which must be followed in the U.S. and Europe, do not have to be followed in many poor countries.  This is attractive for a TNC so that bottom line profits can increase.  In many factories, workers are often exploited by low wages, long hours, and poor working conditions.  Wal-Mart factory workers in China report working fourteen hours a day for less than $3 per day in a hot room with only one fan.  One woman described that rent was deducted from her wages, even after she moved out of the dormitory.  During official inspection from outsiders, workers were taught how to lie about working hours and how to present fake pay slips.  Workers also faced the threat of physical harassment from managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;/&gt; There are about 65,000 TNCs across the world today.  TNCs continue to take materials and cheap labor from underdeveloped countries.

==Consequences of Inequality==
There are many consequences that result from inequality, including reduced access to education and limited social capital.  Inequality also appears to affect physical abilities.  For instance, children raised in less affluent homes have a reduced likelihood of reaching their cognitive potential due to their access to limited resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerDrob2009&quot;&gt;Tucker-Drob, Elliot M., K. Paige Harden, and Eric Turkheimer. 2009. “Combining Nonlinear Biometric and Psychometric Models of Cognitive Abilities.” Behavior genetics 39(5):461-471.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, children in poorer homes are sometimes less intelligent not because they do not have the same genetic intelligence but because their resource-poor environment limits their genetic potential. Another consequence of inequality is slower physical development.  Children from disadvantaged homes are more likely to be delayed in fundamental motor skills, like running, catching, throwing, and kicking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodway2010&quot;&gt;Goodway, Jacqueline D., Leah E. Robinson, and Heather Crowe. 2010. “Gender Differences in Fundamental Motor Skill Development in Disadvantaged Preschoolers From Two Geographical Regions.” Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 81(1):17–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  One consequence of these delays is a lower likelihood of participating in both sports and exercise.

==Questions for Discussion==
#Think about the jobs you have held.  What factors do you think led you to getting the job and what factors affected the salary that you received?
#How do you think your gender, race, and socioeconomic position have affected your path through life so far?
#How does a functionalist understand inequality?  How does a conflict theorist understand inequality?
#If our actions and behaviors mostly reproduce the condition in which we live, how can we change inequality?
#What can be done to lessen the negative effects of inequality on people’s lives?

==Applying Knowledge==
Students studying sociology can apply their knowledge of inequality and poverty by serving in a number of organizations in the U.S. and around the world.  Check out the following organizations:
*[http://www.americorps.org AmeriCorps] helps those in need through organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross, and Big Brothers Big Sisters.
*[http://www.thp.org The Hunger Project] is committed to ending hunger around the world.
*[http://www.care.org CARE International] assists the world’s poor in their efforts to achieve social and economic well-being.
*[http://www.peacecorps.gov Peace Corps] volunteers help individuals and communities around the world improve their quality of life.

==Introduction== 
Sociologists study religion the same way they study other social institutions, like education or government.  The aim is primarily to understand religions, but included in trying to understand religions is the aim of trying to predict what religions will eventually do (or what will become of religions).  To do this, sociologists employ demographic techniques, survey analysis, ethnography, and various other methodological approaches.  It is important to note at the beginning of this chapter that sociologists study religion not to prove, disprove or normatively evaluate religion.  Sociologists aren't interested in whether a religion is right or wrong.  This requires sociologists to assume a relativistic perspective that basically takes a neutral stance toward issues of right or wrong or true or false.  That said, the social scientific study of religion can be challenging from a faith standpoint as it provides alternative, naturalistic explanations for many elements of religion (e.g., the sources of conversion experiences&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;&gt;Batson, C. Daniel, Schoenrade, Patricia, and Ventis, W. Larry. 1993. Religion and the Individual: A Social-Psychological Perspective. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195062094&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Definitions of Religion==
The starting point for any study of religion should begin with a definition of the concept.  This is particularly important in the study of religion because the definition determines which groups will be included in the analysis.  Three general definitions have been proposed, each of which will be discussed briefly.  Each definition has its merits and detriments, but what one often finds is that the definition of religion employed by a particular researcher or in the investigation of a particular topic depends on the question being asked.  

===Sacred vs. Profane===
Perhaps the most well known definition of religion is that provided by [[w:Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1995. Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Free Press. ISBN 0029079373&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim argued that the definition of religion hinged on the distinction between things that are sacred (set apart from daily life) and things that are profane (everyday, mundane elements of society). The sacred elements of social life are what make up religion. 

For example, the Torah in Judaism is sacred and treated with reverence and respect. The reverential treatment of the Torah would be contrasted with all sorts of more mundane things like cars or toys, which, for most people, are not considered sacred.  Yet, the acute reader will be quick to point out that for some, cars (and even toys) are considered sacred and treated almost as reverentially as the Torah is treated in Judaism.  This introduces one of the most significant criticisms of this definition - the typology can include things that are not traditionally understood to be religious (like cars or toys).  As a result, the definition is extremely broad and can encompass substantial elements of social life.  For instance, while most people in the United States would not consider their nationalism to be religious, they do hold the flag, the nation's capitol, and other national monuments to be sacred.  Under this definition, nationalism would be considered religion.

===Religion as Existential Questioning===
Another  definition of religion among social scientists (particularly social psychologists) views religion as any attempt to answer existential questions (e.g., 'Is there life after death?&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yinger1970&quot;&gt;Yinger, J. 1970. The Scientific Study of Religion. New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;).  This definition casts religion in a functional light as it is seen as serving a specific purpose in society. As is the case with the sacred/profane typology, this definition is also often critiqued for being broad and overly encompassing. For instance, using this definition, someone who attends religious services weekly but makes no attempt to answer existential questions would not be considered religious.  At the other extreme, an atheist who believes that existence ends with physical death, would be considered religious because he/she has attempted to answer a key existential question. (For a critique of this definition, see Dobbelaere&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobbelaere2002&quot;&gt;Dobbelaere, Karel. 2002. Secularization: An Analysis at Three Levels (Gods, Humans, and Religions). New York: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.)

[[Image:Statue of Zeus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Greek god Zeus.]]

===Religion as Supernature===
The third social scientific definition views religion as the collective beliefs and rituals of a group relating to supernature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tylor1976&quot;&gt;Tylor, Edward Burnett. 1976. Primitive culture: Researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom. Gordon Press. ISBN 087968464X&lt;/ref&gt; This view of religion draws a sometimes ambiguous line between beliefs and rituals relating to empirical, definable phenomena and those relating to undefinable or unobservable phenomena, such as spirits, god(s), and angels.  This definition is not without its problems as well, as some argue it can also include atheists who have a specific position against the existence of a god (or gods). Yet because the beliefs and rituals are understood to be shared by a group, this definition could be argued to exclude atheists. Despite the problems with this last definition, it does most closely adhere to the traditional (and popular) view of what constitutes a religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark2000&quot;&gt;Stark, Rodney and Finke, Roger. Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion. California: University of California Press; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Church-Sect Typology==
Having defined religion, we now move to one of the most common classification schemes employed in sociology for differentiating between different types of religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson1963&quot;&gt;Johnson, Benton. 1963. On Church and Sect. American Sociological Review. 28:539-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troeltsch1931&quot;&gt;Troeltsch, Ernst. 1931. The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  This scheme has its origins in the work of Max Weber, but has seen numerous contributions since then.  The basic idea is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of ''sects'' to the equilibrium maintaining ''churches''.  Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn.  The reader may notice that many of the labels for the types of religion are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably.  Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics.

Before describing these different religions, it is important for the reader to understand that these classifications are a good example of what sociologists refer to as ''ideal types''.  Ideal types are ''pure'' examples of the categories.  Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually adheres to their ''ideal type'' classification will vary.  Even so, the classification scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions.

[[image:Church-sect continuum.svg|center|thumb|600px]]

===Church and Ecclesia===
The first type of religion is the ''church''. The ''church'' classification describes religions that are all-embracing of religious expression in a society.  Religions of this type are the guardians of religion for all members of the societies in which they are located and tolerate no religious competition.  They also strive to provide an all-encompassing worldview for their adherents and are typically enmeshed with the political and economic structures of society.  

Johnstone&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnstone1997&quot;&gt;Johnstone, Ronald L. 1997. Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion. Fifth Edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. ISBN 0131254367&lt;/ref&gt; provides the following seven characteristics of churches:
#claim universality, include all members of the society within their ranks, and have a strong tendency to equate 'citizenship' with 'membership
#exercise religious monopoly and try to eliminate religious competition
#very closely allied with the state and secular powers - frequently there is overlapping of responsibilities and much mutual reinforcement
#extensively organized as a hierarchical bureaucratic institution with a complex division of labor
#employ professional, full-time clergy who possess the appropriate credentials of education and formal ordination
#almost by definition gain new members through natural reproduction and the socialization of children into the ranks
#allow for diversity by creating different groups within the church (e.g., orders of nuns or monks) rather than through the formation of new religions

The classical example of a ''church'' is the Roman Catholic Church, especially in the past.  Today, the Roman Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of religious pluralism or competition among religions.  This is especially true of Catholicism in the United States.  The change from a ''church'' to a ''denomination'' is still underway in many Latin American countries where the majority of citizens remain Catholics.

A slight modification of the ''church'' type is that of ''ecclesia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;vonWiese1932&quot;&gt;von Wiese, Leopold. 1932. Systematic sociology. Chapman and Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body.  The state churches of some European countries would fit this type.

===Denominations===
The ''denomination'' lies between the church and the sect on the continuum.  Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society.  A denomination is one religion among many.  When churches and/or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations:&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnstone1997&quot;/&gt;
#similar to churches, but unlike sects, in being on relatively good terms with the state and secular powers and may even attempt to influence government at times
#maintain at least tolerant and usually fairly friendly relationships with other denominations in a context of religious pluralism
#rely primarily on birth for membership increase, though it will also accept converts; some even actively pursue evangelization
#accept the principle of at least modestly changing doctrine and practice and tolerate some theological diversity and dispute
#follow a fairly routinized ritual and worship service that explicitly discourages spontaneous emotional expression
#train and employ professional clergy who must meet formal requirements for certification
#accept less extensive involvement from members than do sects, but more involvement than churches
#often draw disproportionately from the middle and upper classes of society

Most of the major religious bodies in the U.S. are denominations (e.g., Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans).

===Sects===
''Sects'' are newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a denomination).  Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to ''true'' religion. 

Interestingly, leaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio-economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not entirely understood.  Most scholars believe that when sect formation does involve social class distinctions they involve an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status. An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth).

Another interesting fact about sects is that after their formation, they can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination.  If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve.  If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior.  The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects.  The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an ''institutionalized sect'' can result.  Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development.  They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics.  Examples include: Hutterites and the Amish.

Most of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of Lutheranism).  Examples include: Methodists, Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists.

===Cults or New Religious Movements===
''Cults'' are, like sects, new religious groups.  But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group (though they often do).  The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they are not advocating a return to ''pure'' religion but rather the embracement of something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scripture or new prophecy).  Cults are also more likely to be led by ''charismatic leaders'' than are other religious groups and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult.
[[Image:Falungongmay2005-2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Falun Gong practitioners in London; Falun Gong is a new religious movement.]]

Cults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies from many sources.  Cults emphasize the individual and individual peace.  Cults also tend to attract the socially disenchanted or unattached (though this isn't always the case; see Aho 1990 and Barker 1984).  Cults tend to be located in urban centers where they can draw upon large populations for membership.  Finally, cults tend to be transitory as they often dissolve upon the death or discrediting of their founder and charismatic leader.

Cults, like sects, can develop into denominations.  As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations.  Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics (e.g., Temple Worship among Mormons). But given their closer semblance to denominations than to the ''cult'' type, it is more accurate to describe them as denominations.  Some denominations in the U.S. that began as cults include: Christian Science, and The Nation of Islam.

Finally, it should be noted that there is a push in the social scientific study of religion to begin referring to ''cults'' as ''New Religious Movements'' or ''NRMs''.  The reasoning behind this is because ''cult'' has made its way into popular language as a derogatory label rather than as a specific type of religious group.  Most religious people would do well to remember the social scientific meaning of the word ''cult'' and, in most cases, realize that three of the major world religions originated as cults, including: Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism.

==Theories of Religion==
Many of the early sociological theorists&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;&gt;Marx, Karl; McLellan, David. 2000. Karl Marx: Selected Writings. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0198782659.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed theories attempting to explain religion.  In addition to these classical approaches to understanding religion, one modern explanation for the continued high levels of religiosity will be proposed along with a social psychological explanation that will attempt to explain the continued attraction of religion. These theories approach religion from slightly different perspectives, trying to explain: (1) the function of religion in society; (2) the role of religion in the life of the individual; and (3) the nature (and origin) of religion.  

===Structural-Functional===
The ''Structural-Functional'' approach to religion has its roots in Emile Durkheim's work on religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;/&gt;  Durkheim argued that religion is, in a sense, the celebration and even (self-) worship of human society. Given this approach, Durkheim proposed that religion has three major functions in society:
#social cohesion - religion helps maintain social solidarity through shared rituals and beliefs
#social control - religious based morals and norms help maintain conformity and control in society; religion can also legitimize the political system
#providing meaning and purpose - religion can provide answers to existential questions (see the social-psychological approach below)

The primary criticism of the structural-functional approach to religion is that it overlooks religion's dysfunctions.  For instance, religion can be used to justify terrorism and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juergensmeyer2000&quot;&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. 2000. Terror in the Mind of God. University of California Press. ISBN 0520240111&lt;/ref&gt;  Religion has often been the justification of and motivation for war.  In one sense, this still fits the structural-functional approach as it provides social cohesion among the members of one party in a conflict (e.g., the social cohesion among the members of a terrorist group is high), but in a broader sense, religion is obviously resulting in conflict, not the resolution of such.

===Social-Conflict===
The social-conflict approach is rooted in Marx's analysis of capitalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;/&gt; According to Marx, religion plays a significant role in maintaining the status quo.  Marx argued that religion was actually a tool of the bourgeoisie to keep the proletariat content.  Marx argued that religion is able to do this by promising rewards in the after-life rather than in this life.  It is in this sense that Marx said, &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the feeling of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless circumstances. It is the opium of the people... The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness&quot; (p. 72).&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;/&gt;  What Marx meant is that it would be necessary for the proletariat to throw off religion and its deceit about ''other-worldly'' rewards in order for the proletariat to rise up against the bourgeoisie and gain control over the means of production so they could realize ''this-worldly'' rewards. Thus, the social-conflict approach to religion highlights how it functions to maintain social inequality by providing a worldview that justifies oppression.

It should be reiterated here that Marx's approach to sociology was critical in the sense that it advocated change (in contrast to the ''knowledge for knowledge's sake'' approach). Because criticism of the system in place when he was writing was inherent in Marx's approach, he took a particular stand on the existence of religion, namely, that it should be done away with.

===Social Constructionist===
The ''social constructionist'' approach to religion presents a naturalistic explanation of the origins of religion.  Berger&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;&gt;Berger, Peter L. 1967, 1990 edition. The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory. Doubleday. ASIN B0006BQVHY&lt;/ref&gt; laid a framework for this approach, &quot;Religion is the human enterprise by which a sacred cosmos is established. Put differently, religion is cosmization in a sacred mode. Use of the word sacred in this context refers to a quality of mysterious and awesome power, other than man and yet related to him, which is believed to reside in certain objects of experience&quot; (p. 25).  In other words, for the social constructionist, religion is not created by (or for) supernatural beings but rather is the result of societies delineating certain elements of society as sacred.  In the social constructionist frame of mind, these elements of society are then objectified in society so they seem to take on an existence of their own.  As a result, they can then act back on the individual (e.g., the influence of a religion on the individual).

Another important element of religion discussed by Berger&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;/&gt; in his outline of the social constructionist approach is the idea of ''plausibility structures''.  According to Berger, 

:The reality of the Christian world depends upon the presence of social structures within which this reality is taken for granted and within which successive generations of individuals are socialized in such a way that this world will be real to them. When this plausibility structure loses its intactness or continuity, the Christian world begins to totter and its reality ceases to impose itself as self-evident truth. (p. 46)&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;/&gt;  

In short, plausibility structures are the societal elements that provide the support for a set of beliefs (not necessarily religious), including people, institutions, and the processes by which the beliefs are spread, e.g. socialization.  Another important element to consider of plausibility structures is mentioned by Berger, &quot;When an entire society serves as the plausibility structure for a religiously legitimated world, all the important social processes within it serve to confirm and reconfirm the reality of this world&quot; (p. 47).&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;/&gt;  In other words, in certain societies, every component of society functions to reinforce the belief system.  A good example of this may be Iran, where everything is structured to reinforce the Islamic faith as ''reality''.

===Religious Pluralism===
Religious pluralism is the belief that one can overcome religious differences between different religions and denominational conflicts within the same religion. For most religious traditions, religious pluralism is essentially based on a non-literal view of one's religious traditions, allowing for respect to be engendered between different traditions on core principles rather than more marginal issues. It is perhaps summarized as an attitude which rejects focus on immaterial differences and instead gives respect to those beliefs held in common.

The existence of religious pluralism depends on the existence of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is when different religions of a particular region possess the same rights of worship and public expression. Freedom of religion is consequently weakened when one religion is given rights or privileges denied to others, as in certain European countries where Roman Catholicism or regional forms of Protestantism have special status. (For example see the Lateran Treaty and Church of England; also, in Saudi Arabia the public practice of religions other than Islam is forbidden.) Religious freedom has not existed at all in some communist countries where the state restricts or prevents the public expression of religious belief and may even actively persecute individual religions (see for example North Korea).

Religious Pluralism has also been argued to be a factor in the continued existence of religion in the U.S.  This theoretical approach&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore1994&quot;&gt;Moore, R. Laurence. 1994. Selling God. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195098382&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that because no religion was guaranteed a monopoly in the U.S., religious pluralism led to the conversion of religions in the U.S. into capitalist organizations.  As a result, religions are now better understood as capitalist corporations peddling their wares in a highly competitive market than they are as monopolistic Churches like Roman Catholicism was prior to [[w:Reformation|The Reformation]] (or, some might argue, still is in Latin America) or as small, fervent, protest-like sects are.  The result of religious pluralism is, like capitalism generally in the U.S., a ''consumer'' attitude: people ''consume'' religion like they do other goods.  Because religions are good at marketing themselves as the providers of social psychological compensators (see below), they have been successful.

===Social-Psychological===
The primary social-psychological reason why religion continues to exist is because it answers existential questions that are difficult, if not impossible, to address scientifically.  For instance, science may not be able to address the question of what happens when someone dies other than to provide a biological explanation (i.e., the body's cells eventually die due to lack of nutrition, the body then decomposes, etc.).  Science is also unable to address the question of a ''higher'' purpose in life other than simply to reproduce.  Finally, science cannot disprove or prove the existence of a higher being. Each of these existential components are discussed below in greater detail.

Studies have found that fear is a factor in religious conversion.  Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1997), in their book ''Amazing Conversions'', note that one of the primary motivations for people to seek religion was fear of the unknown; specifically, fear of the after-life and what it portends.  While fear likely does not motivate all religious people, it certainly is a factor for some.  Religion can provide a ''non-falsifiable'' answer to the question of what happens after people die.  Such answers can provide comfort for individuals who want to know what will happen when they die.

Religion providing a purpose in life was also a motivation found by Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1997) in their analysis of religious converts.  Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; and Spilka, Hunsberger, Gorsuch, and Hood&lt;ref name=&quot;Spilka2003&quot;&gt;Spilka, B.; Hunsberger, B.; Gorsuch, R.; Hood, R.W. Jr. 2003. The Psychology of Religion. The Guilford Press. ISBN 1572309016.&lt;/ref&gt; also point to this factor as an explanation for the continued interest in religiosity.  Interestingly, Diener,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diener1999&quot;&gt;Diener, E.; Suh, E. M.; Lucas, R. E., and Smith, H. L. 1999. Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress. Psychological Bulletin. 125(2).&lt;/ref&gt; in his research on subjective well-being (SWB) notes that one of the keys to high SWB (a.k.a. happiness) is a goal or purpose in life.  However, he introduces a caveat that is particularly telling for religious individuals – for the most positive impact on SWB, goals should be difficult but attainable.  ''Difficult but attainable'' is a good description of salvation for religious people. People have to work toward salvation, but they believe it can be achieved.  Thus, religion can provide a goal and purpose in life for people who believe they need one.

Belief in God is attributable to a combination of the above factors (i.e., God's existence alleviates fear of death and provides meaning), but is also informed by a discussion of [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|socialization]].  The biggest predictor of adult religiosity is parental religiosity; if a person's parents were religious when he was a child, he is likely to be religious when he grows up.  Children are socialized into religion by their parents and their peers and, as a result, they tend to stay in religions.  Alternatively, children raised in secular homes tend not to convert to religion.  This is the underlying premise of Altemeyer and Hunsberger's (1997) main thesis – they found some interesting cases where just the opposite seemed to happen; secular people converted to religion and religious people became secular.  Despite these rare exceptions, the process of socialization is certainly a significant factor in the continued existence of religion.

Combined, these three social-psychological components explain, with the help of religious pluralism, the continued high levels of religiosity in the U.S.  People are afraid of things they do not understand (death), they feel they need a purpose in life to be happy (a.k.a. SWB), and they are socialized into religion and believing in God by parents.

==World Religions and Religious History==
[[Image:Alte Synagoge Essen.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A Jewish synagogue.]]

If one were to ask any sociologist of religion which are the ''world'' religions, they would likely give the standard answer that there are five world religions:
*Christianity
*Hinduism
*Islam
*Buddhism
*Judaism

Traditionally, these have been considered ''world'' religions due to their size and/or influence on society.  A detailed description of these religions is beyond the scope of this chapter and the interested reader is encouraged to follow the above links for more information.  

One note is, however, in order concerning these religious groups. The classification of these groups as ''world'' religions is, like all classifications, artificial.  Considering the remarkable dissimilarity between these five religious bodies, that they are grouped together at all is remarkable.  Three are ''religions of the book'' and can be practiced somewhat distinctly from one’s primary cultural identity (e.g., being an American and Episcopalian), while two are better understood as synonymous with culture (Buddhism and Hinduism).  Additionally, the religions of the book have numerous branches, some so dissimilar that there is more contention within the world religions than between them (e.g., Mormons vs. fundamentalist Christians, Catholics vs. Episcopalians).  Finally, while four of these religious groups are very populous, Judaism is not.  In short, classification as a world religion seems a little arbitrary.  Even so, most people should make an effort to familiarize themselves with these religious groups to facilitate understanding.

==Religion and Other Social Factors==
===Religion and Gender===
Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; provide a clear summary of the differences in religiosity between men and women:

:There is considerable evidence that women are more likely to be interested and involved in religion than men. Women rate their religious beliefs as important more than do men, and they are more likely to report having had a religious or mystical experience... More women than men report having attended religious services in the past week (46% compared with 33%); more women hold membership in a church or synagogue (74% compared with 63%); and more women report watching religious programs (53% compared with 44%). Women are more likely than men to read the Bible at least monthly (56% compared with 41%) and to report having &quot;a great deal of confidence&quot; in organized religion (62% compared with 52%)... Among Christian denominations, as one moves away from the established, traditional churches (e.g., Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Episcopal) toward newer, less traditional ones (e.g., Assembly of God, Pentecostal) the proportion of women members relative to men increases... In sum, although the differences are not always large, they are remarkably consistent: Women appear to be more religious-than-men. (p. 33)

One explanation for the greater involvement of women in religion is socialization.  Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; discuss the idea that women may be socialized into roles in which religion is more highly emphasized than it is in men's roles.

Counter-intuitively, even though women are more religious than men, many religions continue to disenfranchise women.  Roughly 50% of the major denominations in the U.S. today do not allow women to be ordained or otherwise serve in ways that are equal to men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;&gt;Chaves, Mark. 1999. Ordaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Denominations that do not allow female ordination include: Roman Catholicism, Southern Baptists, and Mormons.  The primary reasons these religions refuse to allow women to be ordained are Biblical literalism (believing the Bible is the literal word of god and not believing that it is a historical work written in a different time) and sacramentalism (the belief that the person performing sacramental rituals must represent Jesus in his &quot;manliness&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;  However, Chaves, who delineated these reasons in his book on female ordination, notes that these are more akin to &quot;manifest&quot; reasons and the real or latent reason is because these religions continue to cater to a specific market niche - individuals who oppose modernity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;  Fundamentalist religions in general - including fundamentalist Islam and fundamentalist Christianity - aim primarily to retain the power of men and subjugate women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;

Even within the religions that do allow women equal rights and ordination, women experience discrimination.  Women who pursue ordination in these religions find it harder to find a job pastoring a congregation, are more likely to be assistant pastors than are men, and are more likely to find jobs in congregations that are smaller, rural, and/or pay less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;  As of 2006, women make up about 15% of clergy in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatisticalAbstract2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/labor_force_employment_earnings/employed_persons.html Statistical Abstract 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and Race===
Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; provide a clear summary of differences in religiosity by race (limited presently to Americans of African and European descent).  They include five distinctions in their discussion. If you are an American of African descent, you are more likely to:
#attend religious services
#hold traditional religious beliefs
#feel strongly about your religious beliefs 
#report having had religious experiences 
#consider religion to be important in your life - both when you were growing up and as an adult

Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; attributes this to the religious institutions' role in the lives of Americans of African descent.  Religion has been one of the primary resources that African descendants have drawn upon since their arrival in the U.S.  Religion has provided a sense of community and support for African-Americans and was also extremely influential in the Civil Rights Movement&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris1984&quot;&gt;Morris, Aldon D. 1984. The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement. New York: The Free Press. ISBN 0029221307&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, religion has a more prominent role in the day-to-day lives of African-Americans.

Religion is also divided by race.  Only 8% to 10% of congregations in the U.S. today are multi-racial (meaning no one race/ethnicity makes up more than 80% of the congregation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;&gt;Emerson, Michael O., and Christian Smith. 2001. Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; There are complicated historical reasons for this.  During the U.S. period of slavery, blacks and whites worshiped in the same churches, though blacks were relegated to the balcony and primarily taught to be obedient to their masters.  After the American Civil War, former slaves left the white-dominated religions and created their own as they were mistreated in the white-dominated churches.  Today, predominately black churches and predominately white churches remain distinct with very few churches catering to mixed race congregations (though megachurches tend to be more multi-racial).&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;/&gt;

Emerson and Smith&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;/&gt; convincingly argue that white Evangelical Christians in the U.S., because of their belief in individualism, actually contribute to racial inequality.  This is the result of white Evangelicals refusing to see structural factors that contribute to inequality and their proclivity to blame poor blacks for their poverty. White Evangelical Christians are more likely to attribute black/white inequality it to innate biological inferiority or laziness than are white Mainline Christians and the non-religious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;/&gt;

===Religion and Class===
Socioeconomic status (SES) or class tends to be associated more with how religion is practiced rather than degree of religiosity (i.e., very religious vs. not very religious).  Members of lower classes tend to associate with more fundamentalist religions and sect-like groups.  Members of the middle class tend to belong to more formal churches.  &quot;In the United States, Presbyterians and Episcopalians tend to be above average in SES; Methodists and Lutherans about average; and Baptists and members of Protestant fundamentalist sects below average&quot; (pp.38-39).&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt;  These variations in SES by religious groups are illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:Income Ranking by Religious Group - 2000.png|thumb|600px|center]]

===Religion and Education===
Like income, educational attainment tends to vary by religious group.  People in more fundamentalist religious groups tend to have lower levels of educational attainment while people in more liberal religious groups tend to have higher levels of educational attainment.  This relationship between education and religion is illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:Educational Ranking by Religious Group - 2001.png|thumb|600px|center]]

An important study by Johnson&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson1997&quot;&gt;Johnson, Daniel Carson. Formal Education vs. Religious Belief: Soliciting New Evidence with Multinomial Logit Modeling. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 1997; 36:231-246.&lt;/ref&gt; draws a complex but interesting picture of the relationship between religion and education attainment.  Johnson found a dichotomization of religiosity as a result of college education.  Those who make it through college with their religious beliefs intact tend to be more devout than those who do not attend college to begin with yet remain religious.  On the other side, those who don't make it through college with their religious beliefs intact end up far less orthodox and are more likely to disavow religion altogether.  The relationship between education and religiosity is a dichotomization – college education strengthens both religiosity and irreligiosity, it just depends on where you end up.  Johnson's finding is particularly insightful in light of the social psychological theory of [[w:cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance]], which argues that religious people will (at least initially) reinforce their beliefs in light of disconfirming evidence.

===Religion and Health===
According to Batson et. al.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; the relationship between religion and mental health is highly nuanced.  In order to understand this nuanced relationship, it is necessary to clarify the different types of religiosity Batson et. al. are studying.  Batson et. al. distinguish between three types of religiosity.  These types or orientations stem from the work of Gordon Allport who distinguished two types of religiosity and provided their corresponding labels: intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity.  Extrinsic religiosity refers to people who use religion as a means to an end (e.g., social contacts).  Intrinsic religiosity refers to people who see religion as the end (e.g., religion is the answer to life's questions).  Batson et. al. add a third – quest religiosity.  Quest religiosity refers to the religious seeker who constantly asks questions and may not believe there are any clear answers to them.

If one does not take into consideration the different types of religiosity (i.e., extrinsic, intrinsic, and quest), religion tends to be associated with poorer mental health (p. 240). Specifically, Batson et. al. find a negative relationship between religion and three components of mental health, &quot;personal competence and control, self-acceptance or self-actualization, and open-mindedness and flexibility&quot; (p. 240). 

However, if one does take into consideration the different types of religiosity, then intrinsic and quest oriented individuals tend to see mental health benefits from their religious involvement.  Extrinsically-oriented individuals, on the other hand, find that their religious involvement results in a negative influence on their mental health (p. 289).

==The Future of Religion==
Despite the claims of many classical theorists and sociologists, religion  continues to play a vital role in the lives of individuals.  In America, for example, church attendance has remained relatively stable in the past 40 years.  In Africa and South America, the emergence of Christianity has occurred at a startling rate.  While Africa could claim roughly 10 million Christians in 1900, recent estimates put that number closer to 200 million.  The rise of Islam as a major world religion, especially its newfound influence in the West, is another significant development. In light of these developments, sociologists have been forced to reconsider the early proclamations of the demise of religion.  In addition to discussing secularization and how the theory has been modified due to the continued existence of religion, religious fundamentalism is briefly touched upon as it is playing a significant role in society today.

===Secularization===
'''Secularization''' is a varied term with multiple definitions and levels of meaning.  It should also be noted that in addition to multiple definitions, secularization is both a ''theory'' and a ''process''.  By theory, it is meant that some scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;/&gt; (e.g. [[w:Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[w:Max Weber|Weber]]) believed that as society modernized it would also see a decline in levels of [[w:religiosity|religiosity]].  This understanding of classical secularization theory is currently being refined and modified (see discussion below).  The 'process' component of secularization would refer to how the theory is actualized. It is in this sense that secularization has multiple definitions.  The most common meaning is in reference to the decline of levels of religiosity in society, but this is a broad and diffuse meaning that should be clarified by referring to one of the more specific meanings outlined below.

Sommerville&lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerville1998&quot;&gt;Sommerville, C. J. 1998. &quot;Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term 'Secularization'.&quot; Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined six (6) uses of the term ''secularization'' in the scientific literature.  The first five are more along the lines of ''definitions'' while the sixth application of the term is more of a 'clarification of use' issue:
#When discussing social structures, secularization can refer to [[w:differentiation|differentiation]].  Differentiation (or specialization) is a reference to the increasing division of labor and occupational specialization in society.  While some might consider this a foray into social ''progress'', few would argue that modern societies are less differentiated than more primitive, tribal societies (following the work of [[w:Gerhard Emmanuel Lenski|Gerhard Emmanuel Lenski]]).
#When discussing institutions, secularization can refer to the transformation of an institution that had once been considered religious in character into something not thought of as religious.  A good example of this type of secularization (and differentiation, for that matter) is the transition of Harvard University from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).
#When discussing activities, secularization refers to the transfer of activities from institutions of a religious nature to others without that character.  While the trend toward government assistance in social welfare seems to be reversing in recent years, for much of the 20th century activities that had been in the religious domain  (e.g. soup kitchens) were slowly moving into the secular (or a-religious) realm, often that of government.
#When discussing mentalities, secularization can refer to the transition from ''ultimate'' concerns to ''proximate'' concerns.  This is the most common understanding and usage of the term at the individual level and refers specifically to personal religious decline or movement toward a [[w:secular|secular]] lifestyle.
#When discussing populations, secularization can refer to a societal decline in levels of religiosity (as opposed to the individual-level secularization of definition four).  It should be noted that this understanding of secularization is distinct from definition one (1) in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.  A clear example of this definition of secularization would be the declining religious affiliations in much of modern Europe.
#When discussing religion generally, secularization can only be used unambiguously when referring to religion in a generic sense.  For example, to argue that Christianity is 'secularizing' is not clear unless one specifies exactly which elements of which version of Christianity are being discussed.  What's more, depending on the venue of the discussion, these elements of Christianity may not be recognized by other 'Christian' groups as elements of their version of Christianity.  Thus, if you are interested in discussing religious decline within a specific denomination or religion, you need to specify which elements of that specific group you believe are declining, as Christianity is too variably defined to allow for generalizations for a specific denomination.

===Current Issues in the Study of Secularization===
At present, secularization (as understood in definition five above) is being debated in the sociology of religion.  Some scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark2002&quot;&gt;Stark, Rodney, Laurence R. Iannaccone, Monica Turci, and Marco Zecchi. 2002. &quot;How Much Has Europe Been Secularized?&quot; Inchiesta 32(136):99-112.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining (though their argument tends to be limited to the U.S., an admitted anomaly in the developed world).  As there appears to be some merit to this position, other scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1994&quot;&gt;Chaves, Mark. 1994. &quot;Secularization As Declining Religious Authority.&quot; Social Forces 72(3):749-74.&lt;/ref&gt; have countered by introducing the idea of neo-secularization, which broadens the definition of individual level religious decline by arguing that secularization can also refer to the decline of religious authority.  In other words, rather than using a-religious apostates as the solitary measure of a population's secularity, neo-secularization theory argues that individuals are increasingly looking outside of religion for authoritative positions on different topics.  Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion is no longer the authority on issues like whether to use birth control and would therefore argue that while religious affiliation may not be declining in the U.S. (a debate still taking place), religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place.

===Religious Fundamentalism===
[[Image:Wtc-2004-memorial.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The destruction of the World Trade Centers in 2001 was inspired by the extreme views of religion.]]

''Fundamentalism'' describes a movement to return to what is considered the defining or founding principles of a religion. It has especially come to refer to any religious enclave that intentionally resists identification with the larger religious group in which it originally arose, on the basis that fundamental principles upon which the larger religious group is supposedly founded have become corrupt or displaced by alternative principles hostile to its identity. A full analysis of what constitutes religious fundamentalism is beyond the scope of this chapter.  However, the interested reader is encouraged to explore this topic further by reading the Wikipedia article on [[w:fundamentalism|fundamentalism]].

Religious fundamentalism is of great importance to sociologists because of its increasingly prominent role in social life, especially politics. Kenneth Wald&lt;ref name=&quot;Wald2003&quot;&gt;Wald, Kenneth D. 2003. Religion and Politics in the United States. Fourth ed. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.. ISBN 0742518418&lt;/ref&gt; points out how religious fundamentalism can be detrimental to politics, specifically a democratic system. The fundamentalist approach to politics can hurt a democratic system because of fundamentalists' unwillingness to compromise. Religious fundamentalists tend to take the view that 'God said it, so it will have to be this way.' Because anything short of God’s will is unacceptable, religious fundamentalists don't allow for a middle ground - which is a vital element of the democratic process. While widely associated with religious fundamentalism, suicide bombers are not exclusively religious; only 43% are identifiably religious.&lt;ref name=&quot;brym2007&quot;&gt;brym, robert j. 2007. “six lessons of suicide bombers.” Contexts 6:40-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Most suicide bombings are for strategic, political reasons, and usually involve a dispute over resources.  Religion can serve as a justification and can even help motivate the bombers, but not all terrorism is inspired by religion and religious fundamentalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;brym2007&quot;/&gt;

What the future of religious fundamentalism holds for human society is unknown, but because of the impact of this particular religious approach on society today, religious fundamentalism warrants continued study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Systems theory''' or '''general systems theory''' or '''systemics''' is an interdisciplinary field which studies systems as a whole. Systems theory was founded by [[w:Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[w:William Ross Ashby|William Ross Ashby]] and others between the 1940s and the 1970s on principles from physics, biology and engineering and later grew into numerous fields including philosophy, sociology, organizational theory, management, psychotherapy (within family systems therapy) and economics among others. Cybernetics is a closely related field.  In recent times '''complex systems''' has increasingly been used as a synonym. 

==Overview==

Systems theory focuses on complexity and interdependence.  A system is composed of regularly interacting or interdependent groups of activities/parts that form a whole.  

Part of systems theory, ''system dynamics'' is a method for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system -- the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components -- is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are chaos theory and social dynamics.  

Systems theory has also been developed within sociology. The most notable scientist in this area is [[w:Niklas Luhmann|Niklas Luhmann]] (see Luhmann 1994).
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory as organizations are dynamic living entities that are goal-oriented.  The systems approach to organizations relies heavily upon achieving negative entropy through openness and feedback.

In recent years, the field of ''systems thinking'' has been developed to provide techniques for studying systems in holistic ways to supplement more traditional reductionistic methods.  In this more recent tradition, systems theory is considered by some as a humanistic counterpart to the natural sciences.

==History==

Subjects like complexity, self-organization, connectionism and adaptive systems had already been studied in the 1940s and 1950s, in fields like cybernetics through researchers like [[w:Norbert Wiener|Norbert Wiener]], [[w:William Ross Ashby|William Ross Ashby]], [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] and Heinz Von Foerster.  They only lacked the right tools, and tackled complex systems with mathematics, pencil and paper. John von Neumann discovered cellular automata and self-reproducing systems without computers, with only pencil and paper. [[w:Aleksandr Lyapunov|Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[w:Jules Henri Poincaré|Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of chaos theory without any computer at all.

All of the &quot;C&quot;-Theories below - cybernetics, catastrophe theory, chaos theory,... - have the common goal to explain complex systems which consist of a large number of mutually 
interacting and interwoven parts. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]], and artificial life (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general complex systems.  The best context to compare the different &quot;C&quot;-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when
Edward Lorenz accidentally discovered a strange attractor with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without computers today.

===Timeline===
*1960 cybernetics (W. Ross Ashby, Norbert Wiener) Mathematical theory of the communication and control of systems through regulatory feedback. Closely related: &quot;control theory&quot; and &quot;general systems theory&quot; founded by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and W. Ross Ashby
*1970 catastrophe theory (René Thom, E.C. Zeeman) Branch of mathematics that deals with bifurcations in dynamical systems, classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances.
*1980 chaos theory (David Ruelle, Edward Lorenz, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Steve Smale, James A. Yorke....) Mathematical theory of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes bifurcations, strange attractors, and chaotic motions.
*1990 complex adaptive systems (CAS) (John H. Holland, Murray Gell-Mann, Harold Morowitz, W. Brian Arthur,..)  The &quot;new&quot; science of complexity which describes emergence, adaptation and self-organization was established mainly by researchers of the SFI and is based on agents and computer simulations and includes multi-agent systems (MAS) which have become an important tool to study social and complex  systems. CAS  are still an active field of research.

== References ==
There are four comprehensive world-wide stamp catalogues currently published on an annual or less frequent regular basis.  They are all multi-volume publications.  Nothing suggests that any of them makes any attempt whatsoever to provide information consistent with any of the others.  The information on any one can completely contradict the information on the others, and often does.  All of these catalogues have been produced in many editions, and some degree of consistency is maintained between successive editions.  Users should be aware, however, that correction and updating of information is common.  References to these and frequently re-edited national and regional catalogues will not normally show the edition unless some point needs to be brought to the attention of the reader.  Anyone working with the material should still prefer the most recent editions available.

The four world-wide catalogues are
* '''''[[w:Stanley Gibbons catalogue|Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue]]''''' produced in English by the Stanley Gibbons Company of London, England.  It tends to be the standard reference in most Commonwealth countries except Canada.  A Gibbons catalogue number is referenced with &quot;'''SG'''&quot;.
* '''''[[w:Michel catalog|Michel Katalog]]''''' produced in German by the Michel Company of Munich.  A Michel catalog number is referenced with &quot;'''Mi'''&quot;.
* '''''[[w:Scott catalogue|Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalog]]''''' produced in English by the Scott Publishing Co. of Sidney, Ohio, USA.  It tends to be the standard reference in North America.  A Scott catalog number is referenced with &quot;'''Sc'''&quot;.
* '''''[[w:Yvert et Tellier|Yvert et Tellier catalogue de timbres-poste]]''''' produced in French by Éditions Yvert &amp; Tellier of Amiens, France.  An Yvert catalogue number is referenced with &quot;'''YT'''&quot;.

Other world-wide catalogues which are no longer in production, such as those by Minkus and Senf, will be described as needed.  Catalogues and other reference works relevant to only a small number of countries will be described where needed.

== Introduction ==
In descending order of number of species, the orders of insects are:
# Coleoptera (Beetles)
# Lepidoptera (Butterflies and moths)
# Diptera (Flies)
# Hymenoptera (Wasps, bees, and ants)
# Hemiptera (true bugs)
# Orthoptera (Grasshopers, crickets, and mantids)
# Odonata (Dragonflies and damselflies)

== Coleoptera ==

=== ''Coccinella septempunctata'' ===
[[Image:Ladybird.jpg|150px|thumb|left|An adult ''C septempunctata'']]
The seven-spotted ladybird (or ladybug) is a very common beetle found in both North America and Europe, and is an important predator of aphids.
[[Image:Marienkäferlarve (Coccinellidae)  1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Larval stage]]

=== ''Harmonia axyridis'' ===
[[Image:Harmonia axyridis.jpg|150px|thumb|left|An adult Asian lady beetle]]
The  Asian lady beetle (or harlequin ladybird) is a species that is similar to ''C septempunctata''. This species is also an important predator of aphids, however is causes more problems to humans, because they freqently overwinter in homes. The species is originally from East Asia, but was introduced to North America and Europe.
[[Image:HarAxy ontwikkeling.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The life-cycle of ''H axyridis''.]]

== Lepidoptera ==
=== ''Papilio'' ===
The genus Papilio includes many species that are well-known around the world. Such species are charchterised by their &quot;swallowtails&quot; for which they are named.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Swallowtail IMGP6264.jpg| ''Papilio glaucus'', Eastern Tiger Swallowtail
Image:Common Yellow Swallowtail - Papilio machaon I IMG 6962.jpg| ''Papilio machaon'', Old World Swallowtail
Image:Papilio xuthus 070707.jpg| ''Papilio xuthus'', Asian swallowtail
Image:Ppolyc.JPG| ''Papilio polyctor'', Common Peacock
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Danaus plexippus'' ===
[[Image:Monarch Butterfly 17-03-2006 6-44-40 p.m..JPG|150px|thumb|right]]
The Monarch butterfly is common in North America, as well as New Zealand and Australia. It is one of the few milkweed butterflies in North America. As larva, the monarch feeds on milkweed, which is poisonous. This poison persists in the monarch as an adult, which provides it protection from many predators. This is so successful, that ''Limenitis archippus'' (in the same family, but in a different subfamily) mimics the monarch so that it is not eaten by predators.

== Diptera ==
=== ''Musca domestica'' ===
[[Image:Musca.domestica.female.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Female ''Musca domestica'']]
The housefly is very common, and frequently lives with humans. Flies like butterflies undergo complete metamorphosis. In their larval stage they are called ''maggots'', in which they will feed on organic matter. After three instars, they become pupae, then emerge as adults. Like other insects, the purpose of the adult form is for mating— flies live only about one month after maturation.
Flies have sponging mouth-parts. They can only consume liquids, but can also apply digestive fluids to solids, and then ingest them as fluids.

=== Culicidae ===
Mosquitos are known particullarly for spreading disease. Mosquitos, like other flies, undergo compete metamorphosis. Eggs, larvae, and pupae develop in water, but the adult is terrestrial. The larvae also develop in three instars. The pupae then float to the surface of the body of water, so that the adults can emerge into the air.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:CulexNil.jpg| ''Culex quinquefasciatus''
Image:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg| ''Anopheles stephensi''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Hymenoptera ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:European wasp white bg.jpg| ''Vespula germanica''
Image:Honeybee landing on milkthistle02.jpg| ''Apis mellifera''
Image:Meat eater ant feeding on honey02.jpg| ''Iridomyrmex purpureus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Vespula'' ===
Yellowjackets are wasps that can be found in both Europe and North America. There are two particular species: ''Vespula germanica'' and ''Vespula vulgaris''. These are known as the German wasp and the common wasp, respectively. Yellowjackets are social insects— a queen builds a nest, usually of wood, and then lays eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae are carnivorous, and feed on other insects. Adult wasps feed on nectar. Though, often considered pests or harmful to humans, wasps are important predators of many other pests such as flies.

=== ''Apis'' ===
Honeybees are important plant pollinators.

:Resolved, user blocked, and damage fixed. You did the right thing in reverting the pictures. You could have also uploaded a non-offensive image over the top of the offensive one. Thanks for helping to fight vandalism on Wikibooks.
:PS: A better place to report the vandalism would have been the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:04, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

:Use the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]] page to report damage. Picking a random admin is a good idea only if you are fairly sure that they are currently logged in. People may sleep, go on vacation, get busy at work, study for exams, go to the hospital, lose electrical power... Edits to the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]] page will be spotted either via watchlists or via somebody looking over the [[Special:Recentchanges]] page. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:09, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

== cake category/page merge ==

Hi, I've removed the speedy from the cake page. Any sort of restructuring like this should be discussed on Talk:Cookbook at least to let others know what you're going to do. I tend to think that merging the two '''is''' the correct thing to do, but would like others input first. Also, we're going to be getting the DynamicPageList extension installed which will allow us, for example, to list the pages in Category:Cake on the Cookbook:Cake page, so this might be another resolution. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:23, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
: It just doesn't make any sense to me to have a page with no purpose other than to point to another like that, it may as well be a REDIRECT at that point.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 20:31, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
:: I agree. I've added [[Talk:Cookbook#merging_of_type_and_category_pages]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:34, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

We should start doing this now that it's been posted on [[Talk:Cookbook]] for a while. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:01, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== yams ==

Ha. I mixed up the yam/sweet potato thing in the opposite direction. Thanks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:11, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== units ==

On the [[Cookbook:Cherry Brownies]] page, is that 1.5 square inches or 1.5 inches squared?

* 1.5 inches squared = 2.25 square inches (my guess)
* 1.5 square inches = 1.22 square inches

Since 1 square inch is equal to 1 inch squared, I suggest using that.

Another unconfusing way is to specify both dimensions.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:40, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

: Well, I could just do it as per square, considering.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 01:54, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;''Voting is now officially over.  Vote for the June 2005 collaboration [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month/June 2005 voting|here]].&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''
==Voting rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

==Nominations==
===[[World History]] (11)===
I nominate this Wikibook because I think its the most important History topic, and information about history is readily available to most users.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 18:35, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

This wikibook has been growing over time in an uncontrolled way. A collaboration on this book would first work out in a discussion how to best organize the book, and then take action. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:00, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

===[[Open Culture]] (1)===
This Wikibook is an explanation on what we all are participating to: Open Culture, It would be interesting to develop this Wikibook because it would explain to other people why we want to contribute to things like Wiki or Open Source. It gives us the possibility of understanding what we are doing. --[[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]] 08:33, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

This WikiBook is part of a project to provide educational materials in Africa where budgets do not extend to expensive
royalty laden books. The book is very close to being finished and with a concerted effort from a community like the WikiBooks community it could be finished very quickly. It's a first step on the way to providing educational materials to all. Education is the only way to facilitate lasting peace and stability in developing/3rd world countries.

* The three voters [[User:HeikoStamer|HeikoStamer]], [[User:Vanessa|Vanessa]], and [[User:Rianameyer|Rianameyer]] don't show any user contribution ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=HeikoStamer], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Vanessa], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Rianameyer]) other than the vote on this page. Although this is not part of the rules (yet?) I would suggest that these people make a couple of edits on a wikibook while logged in, before their votes can be counted. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 12:00, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
* I agree, in principle, with the concerns raised by [[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]]. However, I would like to claim that these are somewhat unusual circumstances in that the voters are members of the FHSST project who have helped write the 375 page FHSST_Physics text that was uploaded to WikiBooks.  Because the book was uploaded in an advanced state its edit history is external to WikiBooks but does exist. Irrespective of what happens with vote counting we are all working towards the same thing which is great and I am very glad that people like [[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] are concerned about what happens on WikiBooks and are on the lookout for problems :) [[User:Marknewlyn|Marknewlyn]] 19:54, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*Agreed.  These may or may not be sockpuppets, but we can't risk it.  Their votes are nullified.  I have not removed them per se, but moved them.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 03:22, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* My comments */ My thoughts exactly.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rosebushes ==

A small point of contention:
In colloquial speech, is there really an extra syllable on rosebushes? Consider the word 'street.' S, T, and R are slurred together. Is it not similar with the SH and Z sounds in rosebushes? I don't really hear a vowel.

Is there a such thing as a half syllable?

I'm only an amateur linguist--very amateur--so I could certainly be wrong about this. Thoughts?

: I'm British and in my dialect &amp;lt;rosebushes&amp;gt; is certainly 3 syllabled (roughly /ɹoʊzbʊʃɪz/). Perhaps you don't hear a seperate vowel because you pronounce a syllabic /z/. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]]

A syllable is a unit of pronunciation with one vowel sound, and hence, can't be divided. There are, however, short (pull) and long vowels (pool) and monophthongs (bit), dipfthongs (boy) and triphthongs (fire), where the quality of the vowel changes. As I understand it vowels can be longer and shorter, but it just isn't possible to have half a vowel.


== Thanks ==

Thanks to whoever wrote this text! I start a linguistics program next week and have been trying to wrap my brain around many of the concepts addressed. Now I finally understand the difference between deep and surface structure. 

== Technology? ==

&quot;You may think of language as a technology. Depending on how you define the word, this is either a metaphor, or it is literal truth. It is the artificial use of natural phenomena — sounds, gestures, appearances, textures — for the purpose of communication.&quot;

I've removed that paragraph because 1. It's confusing, 2. Language use is instinctual, not &quot;artificial&quot;, 3. &quot;textures&quot; makes no sense here. [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 20:46, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

== My comments ==



Going through this book as someone who has never studied linguistics and giving some suggestions. Here they are:

I think that two things could be done to improve this introduction. First of all, it is very long, and there was one picture (plus the one of the fork I just added), making it difficult to read. I suggest finding more images to illustrate the text and taking a hatchet to the text and only including what's absolutely necessary and tightening up what still remains after that. To that end, I think the &quot;how do linguists study language&quot; could be removed pretty much entirely, since it basically states what the whole description vs. prescription section says, but less specifically and less eloquently. I also think the case studies could be shortened. Also the whole asterisk thing should be explained all at once.

Second, this page is a bit of a hodgepodge of many things with no clear progression or organization. I think if we sit down and decide what needs to go into an intro of a linguistics text (what is vital that doesn't fit into one of the later chapters). If any of this can be allocated to later chapters, then that should be done, too. So, any thoughts on what should stay and what should go? Personally I think that the idea that linguistics is a descriptive field is vital, although we should take care not to bash prescriptivists ;) . Any other thoughts?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{meat}}

:''Adapted from the public domain USDA article ''[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/ratites.htm FOCUS ON: Ratites (Emu, Ostrich, and Rhea)]''.''

Red meat is now on the &quot;wing&quot; into innovative restaurants and some meat markets. The latest in meat products is from the &quot;'''ratite'''&quot; family of flightless birds. It's lean and tastes like [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], but contains much less [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. In fact, ratite meat is even lower in calories than [[cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] and [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]].

==What are Ratites?==

Ratites are a family of flightless birds with small wings and flat breastbones. '''Ostrich''', '''emu''' and '''rhea''' are members of this family. Ostrich is native to Africa; emu, to Australia; and rhea, to South America -- particularly the grasslands of Argentina.

When fully grown, ostriches -- the largest birds in the world -- stand about seven to eight-feet tall and can weigh 300 to 400 pounds; emu are about six feet tall and weigh 125 to 140 pounds. Adult rheas are about five feet tall and weigh 60 to 100 pounds. The birds are 95-percent usable as meat, feathers, oil and leather.

==How are Ratites Raised?==

Newly hatched chicks usually weigh about two pounds and are about 10 inches tall. Young ratites must be sheltered in a warm place for their first weeks of life. Adolescent and adult birds are allowed to roam freely in fenced pastures or pens. Ratites need daily exercise to avoid leg and digestive problems.

The closely woven wire fences must be 6 to 8-feet high because ratites can leap over a 5-foot fence. Ratites are fed on grain supplemented by pasture. Ostrich was the first ratite to be raised in the U.S. There are now about 1,000 ostrich growers in the U.S. raising about 100,000 birds. Emu are now raised in at least 43 states by about 10,000 families (3,000 are in Texas). The emu population is about a million. Rheas are the newest U.S. farm-raised ratite, but there are currently over 15,000 rheas in the United States.

==Retail Cuts of Fresh Ratites==

Ratite meat is sold as steaks, fillet, medallions (small coin-shaped pieces of meat), roasts and ground meat. The most tender meat comes from the thigh or &quot;fan&quot;; meat also comes from the drum and forequarter.

;Are Ratites &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;White&quot; Meat?

Although ratites are poultry, the pH of their flesh is similar to beef. Therefore, they are classified as &quot;red&quot; meat. The raw meat is a very dark cherry red. After cooking, the meat looks like beef and the flavor is similar but a little sweeter.

==What Cooking Methods Can Be Used?==

The tenderness and texture of farmed ratite meat lends itself to light [[cookbook:Grilling|grilling]], [[Cookbook:Pan frying|pan frying]] or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]]. However, because ratite meat is so low in fat, care must be taken not to overcook it. Especially when roasting ratite meat, it is important to provide ample stock and moisten it, because due to its leanness, it will otherwise become very dry and tough. As a rule of thumb, anything that works for lean [[cookbook:venison|venison]] should work for ratite meat too.

Since ratites are classified as red meats, steaks and roasts can be safely cooked to medium rare (145 °F) up to well done (160 °F); ground meat should be cooked to 160 °F.

==What is the Cost Per Pound?==

At this time, emu, ostrich and rhea meat are specialty items available in restaurants and some stores. The meat is more expensive than beef, [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], chicken and turkey. However, the price will become more reasonable as the quantity of this meat becomes more widely available.</text>

It is irrational to ignore the many double-blind government-sponsored studies that show MSG is harmless.

It is irrational to ignore the simple fact that some foods naturally contain up to 2% unbound glutamate,
including 1.2% in the popular parmesan cheese. The maximum useful MSG doze is 0.8%, because anything more
will max out your tase sensation. If added MSG is a problem, parmesan cheese is a worse problem.</text>

== Film ==

For any movie to be effective, the director must establish a connection between the characters and the audience.   This connection can be created through any number of ways.  For example, any junior athlete can feel a connection with the Mighty Ducks because they share common ambitions.  Likewise, any audience member can feel a connection to Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs, because either they admire his cunning or they detest his lifestyle, or a combination of the two.  However, for a movie to truly captivate an audience, it must go beyond the acting and the writing.  Each scene must put the audience in a very specific mindset, and this is where the combination of auditory and visual rhetoric comes into play.

It is important to remember that for the most part films are narratives. They depict the story of a character or a set of characters and use our cultural and social norms in order to make us feel a certain way about these characters. These narratives may become arguments such as the case in Oliver Stone’s JFK where the filmmaker argues that the assassination was a conspiracy. However, some film may simply “persuade” the audience to become involved with the characters and be entertained by the film (112). It is important to keep in mind that in most films the objective is to make money, there may not always be a defined argument, but the persuasion to spend money on the film is usually there. 

When breaking down the rhetoric of a film or scene is it important to consider the “visual elements – camera movement, placement in the frame, color, spatial relationships among characters and between the viewer and the visual material, special visual effects, visual editing, and so on.” All of these elements make up the composition of the shot (115). This composition is then used by the viewer to make connections between themselves and the character. 

In David Blakeseley’s essay &quot;Defining Film Rhetoric&quot;, he discusses visual rhetoric in film as “…the study of symbolic inducement,” and using all available methods of sending messages to the audience (113).  This is to say that it examines the connection that is (hopefully) created between the film and the audience.  The connection is commonly referred to as audience identification.

So how does this all relate to identification with the characters and the movie?  One theory is that identification occurs in the subconscious.  This identification is prompted by various stimuli (visual or auditory) that occur in the conscious (117).  This is to say that as we watch a movie we are consciously aware of dialogue between characters, their physical settings, and the music or sounds that accompany the scene.  But then our subconscious takes these stimuli one step further, adding subconscious, emotional reactions to the stimuli.  When we see a red rose, we consciously perceive it as just that, but subconsciously we add to it the connotation of love and romance, to give it deeper meaning.  If romantic music is added to the visual then our emotional reaction to the scene becomes that much stronger.

In his directing, Alfred Hitchcock wanted to create identification between characters in addition to identification between the film and the audience.  The musical elements of a film contribute to this identification as well, as the music sets an overall tone for not just a specific character, but for anyone in the scene.  In Lost In Translation, a strong connection is developed between the two main characters, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) develop a very romantic, but non-sexual relationship during their stay at the same hotel in Tokyo, Japan.  The music that is played during their scenes together is not inherently romantic.  There is no Marvin Gaye or Frank Sinatra on the soundtrack.  Instead, the music is of a genre created just within the past few years.  This music, labeled “Trip-Hop”, uses vocals and lyrics more as a supplement to the music, rather than a foregrounded message.  The music production is deeply layered and mixes many different sounds in a non-intrusive manner.

The use of music as a supplemental rhetorical device to cinematic visual rhetoric is often times under-recognized, but is clearly an integral in late 20th and 21st century cinematography.  Without it, scenes would not be as meaningful to our subconscious, which would decrease our ability to establish a connection with the film and its characters.

== Advertising ==
Advertisements are more than celebrity endorsements, showing off products, interruptions in television programs, and pages in magazines. Advertisements surround us, whether or not we are aware of it and constantly attempt to persuade a target audience. Advertising is the most common manifestation of visual rhetoric and perhaps the most recognizable. Ever since the first advertisement in 1704, brands and companies have attempted to sell their ideas, products, and services to the public through various rhetorical strategies. 

In order for an advertisement to be effective it is important for advertisers to know the needs, motivations, and lifestyles of the target audience prior to the creation of an ad. The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade consumers to buy a particular product or service offered by a brand. When advertisements are well-planned and developed, they are not thought of as advertisements, but yet a form of communication. “At its best, it’s memorable, fresh, entertaining, and epitomizes some of the best visual communication anywhere,” (Ryan and Conover 424). 

The society we live in is very visually-inclined, meaning that individuals are drawn to images more than they are drawn to text. A visual message is more memorable than a verbal message because of its power of impact on an audience. Advertisers are aware of this and use it to their advantage by making the graphic element of advertisements the most predominant. 

Advertisers use various appeals to convey certain messages, create an image that the target audience can identify with, and build a relationship with the desired consumers. One of the more dominant rhetorical devices in advertising is the appeal to gender roles. (See: Gender and Visual Rhetoric) The first example of gender-directed advertising occurred in 1911 with a Woodbury Soap advertisement in the Ladies' Home Journal. Advertising can also appeal to historical context, as was the case in 1942 when the War Advertising Agency was created to help gain public support for America's involvement in World War II. 

In 1958, the National Association of Broadcasters banned the use of subliminal ads, messages which contain hidden messages that the audience would not consciously perceive, but would subconsciously absorb.
A concept is central to an advertisement’s success. The advertised brand requests to the hired agency that a certain message and concept be portrayed through the advertisement to an audience. The advertisers manipulate various components to illustrate the underlying concept. Advertisers create and reinforce a brand’s concept through the theme of a brand, the message, the product, the color choices, layout design, and the graphic elements. 

All advertisements contain the same elements: artwork, a headline, copy, and a logotype. The advertisers work hard to make sure all the components flow together and speak the same voice. Each element should reinforce and complement the others in order to create an effective advertisement that makes sense. The graphic component is often the dominant part of an advertisement because of its ability to persuade, inform, and entertain an audience. Advertisers use photographs to connect the advertisements to reality and to the audience; they also use graphics, artwork, and illustrations. In addition to the obvious visual components, advertisers also manipulate the headlines, logotypes, and copy to be visually appealing. Advertisers use specific typography, styles, and formats so that they are visually attractive and catch the audiences’ attention. Due to the limited time that advertisers have to capture and captivate the audiences’ attention, they make sure that every element is attractive and distinguishable. 

Advertising has become a major part of our culture as we see it in various mediums. Advertisements can be seen on TV and before movies, in magazines and newspapers, outdoors on billboards, posters, and buses, on the internet, and more recently in product placements. A product placement does not follow the standard guidelines for ads because they do not overtly sell a product, however, they promote a product indirectly through making an appearance in media. A product placement can be something as simple as the mentioning of a particular brand or using the actual product and showing the brand’s logo.  

Advertisements exemplify visual rhetoric because they encompass the components that make a text both visual and rhetorical through the design process and the purpose of the final product, to make someone think or act.

== Internet ==

''&quot;To be deeply literate in the digital world means being skilled at deciphering complex images and sounds as well as the syntactical subtleties of words.  Above all, it means being at home in a shifting mix of words, images and sounds.&quot;''

				-Richard Lanham''1''

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet Internet] as a medium of visual rhetoric has some unique characteristics.  On one hand, some rhetoricians believe it is a powerful tool of creation and publication but on the other hand, some rhetoricians are weary of its use and contend that the Internet and technology in general are not unbiased.  

The line between verbal text and image seems to blur sometimes, such as in typography.  Type faces, and graphics can easily manipulate the mood of an audience and ultimately have persuasive effects.  The existence of visual rhetoric on the Internet is more complex than matters of aesthetics.

Theories of visual rhetoric can be seen as ways to filter information and determine credibility on the Internet. Alignment, position, spatial orientation and size are also elements of visual rhetoric.

===Visual Literacy===

The first graphical web browser, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29 Mosaic], was introduced in 1992.  Since then, the Internet has become one of the largest sources of ''multimodal texts'' in existence.  Multimodal “texts,” or documents, are those that incorporate any combination of graphics, verbal text, animation and sound. This medium naturally lends itself to multimodal communication because, unlike printed material, “white space” is free.  Text and image can easily be viewed on a single page.

Most visual rhetoric scholars have come to the conclusion that ''visual literacy'' is a matter of being able to read multimodal texts.  These texts combine image and verbal text into a coherent whole, such as a news report on TV or a web page.''2''

The Internet also links thoughts and ideas through hypertext and hypermedia. Not only does this affect the way that an article might look, it has changed the way that people read. The idea behind hypertext, is that things that have already been written in one place need no be repeated. So a link leading to further information is created. ''9''

===Impact on Academia===
''“Electronic technology has prompted so hostile a response from the humanities establishment because it creates a different literacy from our customary print-based one.  As we have seen, electronic ‘text’ mixes word, sound and image in new ways.  It thus draws on different areas of the brain, and lays down different neural pathways within it.  In so doing, it affects ‘the organization of humanistic knowledge’ at the most fundamental organic level.”''

-Richard Lanham

Richard Lanham, Barbara Stafford and others believe that this criticism of Internet content stems from an ancient source—authority of the printed word over other means of communication. “Computers are forcing the recognition that texts are not ‘higher,’ durable monuments to civilization compared to ‘lower,’ fleeting images,” says Stafford.''3''

Impact on Academia There has been a huge impact of academia due to the Internet. Students often times do all their research on-line. While the Internet can be a very helpful tool, the credibility of a site must be taken into account. For instance, if a student were to use a wiki site such as this on as a source the data may be changed later, and his source would be flawed. There is also no way to make sure these sites are completely correct.

===Visual Conventions===

The reality is that we are presently interacting with more information in our daily lives than ever before.  “Information overload” can predictably be observed when college pages.  In a short amount of time, the page must develop the ethos necessary to obtain more than just surface credibility.  Authors must aim for ''earned credibility'', but in order to do so, one must first obtain ''surface credibility.''''4''

Studies like the [http://captology.stanford.edu/pdf/Stanford-MakovskyWebCredStudy2002-prelim.pdf Stanford Web Credibility Studies], are much more far reaching than just developing aesthetically pleasing sites.  It’s about making sites understandable and reducing the frustration of non-veteran surfers who just want to get some research done.  Making the Internet more professional, useable, and universal can benefit more than just the corporate world.  Right now, non-technical Internet use is blocked by issues such as browser compatibility, ridiculous numbers of plug-ins used to view certain file types, confusing navigation and error messages, just to name a few. Users who have been thwarted by these problems have a legitimate argument against Internet use—in many cases, little technological effort has been made to accommodate different audiences.  In addition to these barriers, every time a hoax site''5'' is made or a misleading graphic is used to direct a person to an unwanted sales pitch, Internet credibility as a whole sustains damage in the public view. These are issues that can be addressed rhetorically, since they greatly effect the audience’s reception.

Simply identifying characteristics of information design is interesting, but not ultimately practical to the study of rhetoric, since this method separates the text from context, and the meaning from the making.''6''   These connections are crucial to a deep understanding of the intentionally persuasive aspects of images.  

Visual conventions seem to be a viable solution to increasing the usability of the Internet.  [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia:  The Free Encyclopedia] is an example of a healthy, thriving visual rhetoric community.  Every entry in the Wikipedia is made by users by inserting information into a template.  The template makes it easy for users and contributors to navigate, with tabs at the top for “Discussion,” “Edit this page” and “History” of the changes made to a particular article.  It also aids navigation by making the search box and home page easily accessible from every article.

The site offers a full tutorial on the conventions of the Wikipedia for new contributors.  This tutorial and other pages about how to edit the encyclopedia establish important rules which contribute to the credibility and usability of the site.  Some examples of their established conventions include the wording of headings within the article, how to cite and link to sources, order of sections within the article, making an index (or the system can automatically make one) and how to include credentials, through use of the “Discussion,” “Edit this page” and “History” tabs.  When a site looks professional, audiences are more likely to be receptive.  

Every page of the Wikipedia is set up in the same way, making it extremely easy to use.  The audience only has to learn one set of visual conventions to navigate any Media Wiki site.''7''   This kind of template has not hindered content diversity at all, since images, text, hypertext, sound clips and film clips can all be accommodated by the Media Wiki code.  These sites also adhere to visual conventions that are already widely accepted such as placing legal and copyright information at the very bottom of the page, login links in the upper right corner, and a vertical bar containing frequently used links on the left side of the page.

One example of how visual conventions can be broken is selling ad space where the navigation bar at the left is expected to be.  Sometimes this integration is done intentionally so that surfers will accidentally leave the site they’re trying to view.  This creates frustration in the audience and causes the site’s credibility to decrease in the minds of these users.  Since ads are the main source of revenue for many sites, leaving them off websites is not an option.  Accepted visual conventions provide an easy solution to this problem.  It is widely accepted for sites to have ads in a vertical column down the right side of the page, making it easy for audiences to anticipate where certain content should be.  This is just one way to maintain the integrity and credibility of Internet content.

===Conclusion===

Some textual elements of a web page can be considered visual rhetoric.  For example, just seeing contact information at the bottom of a page can increase surface credibility, without considering what the text actually says.  Just its presence is a rhetorical element.  According to Chaim Perelman, theories of visual rhetoric and the Internet are reflective of the “turn in rhetoric,” the modern approach encompassing all persuasive texts, not just arguments.  He says,  “New rhetoric, or dialectic, covers the whole range of discourse that aims at persuasion and conviction, whatever the audience addressed and whatever the subject matter.”''8''

== Architecture/Interior Design ==

At the beginning of the Industrial Age, skyscrapers were bold statements of engineering achievement and power.  In the mid-20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright's residential architecture design was a statement of harmony between man and nature.  Just like works of traditional art can be rhetorical statements, so too can architecture.

For the purpose of this introduction, I will focus on the rhetoric used in the design of a casino.  When designing the floor plan of a casino, it is necessary to examine the location of every room, its purpose, and its connection (physical and otherwise) with other rooms or areas.  The location of the gaming rooms, restaurants, restrooms, and other high-traffic areas can serve as a rhetorical device.  For example, a much different outcome will be achieved by having bathrooms near every entrance than by having them located near gaming floors.  This strategic placement of items can itself serve as a rhetorical device.

Surprisingly, the manipulation of natural light can also serve as a very strong rhetorical device.  In casinos, natural light is purposefully blocked from coming into the building.  This serves to allow gamblers to lose their sense of time, which will keep them inside the casino for longer periods of time.

Similar practices in rhetoric are used in exterior and interior design, not only in commercial properties, but also in residential and public buildings as well.  Frank Lloyd Wright is recognized as the greatest American architect, and used rhetorical devices in designing his revolutionary buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

Drawing can be loosely defined as mark-making on a flat surface.  Usually, the mark-making device is a pencil and the flat surface is a sheet of paper, but many other combinations of tools and surfaces are possible.  As such, sometimes it is hard to categorize a work as drawing as opposed to some other kind of art, such as painting, printmaking, digital media, or sculpture, which often incorporate mark making.

Learning to draw is considered fundamental to learning to produce other forms of visual art.  Not only are the skills acquired through drawing useful, but a sketch is frequently the first step in producing new artwork.  Drawing is also popular because the necessary materials are cheap and widely available and because the drawing process is fast, direct, and can be done almost anywhere. Drawing is also very revealing as to an artist's ability - his or her understanding of form, grasp of visual poetry, and artistic vision. Master drawings are exquisite, breathtaking, and tell us more about the mind of the artist than a highly polished, fully rendered painting.

== Drawing tools ==

=== Dry media ===

==== Pencils ====

When most people think about drawing tools, they think of the ordinary &quot;number two&quot; pencil, most likely a yellow, hexagonal one, with a pink eraser on the end.  Pencils come in many different styles, however.

The marking core of the pencil is called the &quot;lead&quot;, although these days it doesn't contain any actual lead.  Most pencils contain graphite -- a silvery-gray form of carbon -- as their pigment, although other pigments such as charcoal or various colors are possible.

Graphite leads are rated in relative hardness.  On one side of the scale is &quot;9H&quot;, which is the hardest grade of pencil.  On the other side of the scale is &quot;9B&quot;, which is the softest (&quot;blackest&quot;) grade of pencil.  In the middle of the scale is the &quot;HB&quot; pencil, which corresponds to the standard &quot;number two&quot; pencil.  The &quot;F&quot; grade of pencil is a bit harder than &quot;HB&quot;.  Hardness is not necessarily consistent between brands of pencils; experiment to find a hardness that you feel comfortable with.

Hard lead qualities:
* Capable of very light strokes.
* Stays sharp longer.
* More likely to tear through paper.
* Brittle -- tends to break under pressure.

Soft lead qualities:
* Gives the darkest strokes.
* Dulls quickly.
* Soft -- tends to crumble under pressure.

Graphite is by nature somewhat brittle; care must be taken not to drop pencils or leads or the lead might break, even within a wood casing.

Pencil leads can be packaged in different ways.  The typical packaging is in a wooden casing, which requires a pencil sharpener or a knife to expose the pencil lead for drawing.  It is also possible to buy solid graphite sticks, usually wrapped in plastic, which can be used to make strong, bold marks on the page.  Mechanical pencils use metal or plastic device instead of a casing, feeding out a thin lead.  Lead holders can be thought of a hybrid between mechanical and traditional pencils, since they replace the wooden casing like mechanical pencils but also hold a lead of a thickness comparable to traditional pencils.

A property of mechanical pencils is that their thin leads produce a very even line, unlike thick-leaded pencils, which produce lines whose width varies slightly with pressure, allowing for more expressive linework.  Another property of thick-leaded pencils is that they can be applied to the paper at a sharp angle to quickly apply graphite in a thick shading stroke.  These properties tend to make mechanical pencils more desirable for precise drafting work and thick-leaded pencils more desirable for expressive drawing.

Colored pencils contain a pigment instead of graphite.  The binding material of colored pencil leads varies among brands, leading to different degrees of waxiness or blendability.  Watercolor pencils, a relatively recent development, use a water-soluble binding material which allows the artist to blend colors by brushing water over the artwork.  A special variety of blue pencil -- &quot;non-repro&quot; blue -- does not photocopy well; comic book artists typically use these pencils to lay out their artwork before tracing over it with regular graphite pencils.

Charcoal and conté pencils are simply pencils that contain a charcoal or conté crayon core instead of a graphite one.  See their respective sections below.

Grease pencils use a soft wax as a binding agent, wrapped in a rolled paper casing that is peeled away to expose the core.  Since they use wax as a binding agent, these pencils are similar to crayons.  They produce a bold, dark line which cannot be erased from paper.  They can also produce a temporary line on smooth surfaces that can be wiped away with a solvent; this makes them useful for marking glass or plastic before cutting, for example.

Pencils with wooden casings can come in a variety of shapes, including round or hexagonal.  Oblong or oval casings are also available, which some people find easier to hold and sketch with.  On one hand, they offer both thick and thin surfaces for mark-making.  On the other hand, they don't work in pencil sharpeners and must thus be sharpened with a knife.

For sharpening wood-cased pencils, a variety of mechanical solutions are available, from small, one-piece metal sharpeners, to hand-cranked sharpeners, to electric sharpeners.  An alternative to mechanical sharpening is to whittle the wood casing away with a pocket knife; although this gives an irregular shape to the lead, it allows you to choose as sharp or wide an angle of lead as you want.  Once the pencil is sharpened, some artists prefer to keep it sharp by shaping the point against a piece of scrap paper or sandpaper.  Some art stores sell little pads of sandpaper for this purpose.

==== Charcoals ====

Charcoal is a popular artist's tool because it produces an inky, matte black and can be easily manipulated with the fingers or other smudge tool.  Charcoal work tends to smear more easily than graphite work and usually requires a fixative (see below).  Charcoal is also harder to erase than graphite

Artist's charcoal comes in a variety of forms.  The most popular charcoal tools are compressed charcoal sticks.  With charcoal sticks, the artist can produce both lines (with the tip) and areas of value (with the side).  Charcoal-leaded pencils can also be purchased.

Vine charcoal is a piece of plant that has been turned to charcoal but has not been pulverized and compressed.  Vine charcoal can be held like a pencil or broken and used like charcoal sticks.  Since it has not been compressed, it tends to produce a lighter mark than compressed charcoal.

Some artists prefer to use charcoal powder applied directly to the art surface and manipulated with fingers or brush.  Charcoal or graphite powder can also be placed in a small fabric bag which is then rubbed against the art surface; this produces a subtle shading effect that can be smoothly varied across the page.

==== Metal: Silverpoint, Copperpoint ====


==== Chalks ====

==== Crayons ====

* Conté
* Cray-pas

==== Pastels ====

==== Erasers ====

* Simple rubber erasers (&quot;Pink Pearl&quot;-style)
* gum (crumbly) erasers
* plastic (white block or stick) erasers
* kneaded (&quot;Silly Putty&quot;-like) erasers.

* A note on using a large, clean brush to wipe away eraser crumbs instead of hands.

==== Smudging tools ====

Smudging tools are used to move pigment around on the drawing surface, blending or smearing it.  The simplest smudging tool is the finger, although care should be used not to damage the artwork with the oils from hands.  Cheap (lotion-free!) toilet paper, facial tissues, and Q-Tips can all be used as smudging tools.

Blending stumps (also known as &quot;tortillons&quot; or &quot;smudge sticks&quot;) are lengths of tightly rolled paper that come to a point at one or both ends.  Stumps are useful because they allow for precise blending, by using either the flat or tip of the point.  After a stump has built up an amount of graphite or charcoal on its point, it can be used as a drawing tool in its own right; the light strokes it produces can be useful when first roughing out a piece.

=== Wet media ===

==== Dip pens ====

Dip pens are pens with no internal ink reservoir; the ink is held in the nib at the tip of the pen, so the pen needs to be dipped in an external ink supply regularly to refresh the ink supply.  Dip pens consist of a nib holder and a nib.  Nibs wear out with time and need to be replaced.  Different nibs produce different sizes and shapes of pen strokes.  The &quot;crow's quill&quot; type of nib is frequently used in illustration, since the width of the line it produces can be varied by altering the pressure applied to the paper during the stroke.

==== Disposable and cartridge pens ====

Disposable pens come with an internal ink reservoir that is non-replaceable, while cartridge pens have a replaceable ink reservoir.  Care must be taken in selecting pens for art-making, since many are intended for writing and do not use archival quality ink -- that is, the marks they produce may fade, change color, or alter the paper over time.  Most technical pens are of archival quality.

[[Image:Lobster.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A lobster]]

'''Lobsters''' are crustaceans related to [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], and krill.

In coastal areas close to where lobsters are caught, this seafood is not prohibitively expensive, and lobsters are often considered a summertime picnic treat. However, shipping costs for the living animals are high, so elsewhere lobsters are considered an elegant, formal, showy, and extravagant seafood. Shrimp may be considered a less expensive and difficult substitute. 

When messy eating is acceptable, lobster is served in the shell. Tools, such as pliers and hammers, should be provided to open the brittle shells. For those who desire the distinctive taste of lobster without the mess, there are recipes for prepared lobster meat, such as Lobster Newberg. 

Purchase an actively moving live lobster. Smaller lobsters are a better deal, but extravagant dining may demand the largest specimen available. Remove the rubber bands just before placing the lobster in water. Otherwise, the rubber bands may leave a taste on the lobster. Place the lobsters head first in a large pot of rapidly boiling (optionally salted) water, and allow the water to return to a boil. Boil for ten minutes for the first pound, and around 3 minutes for each additional pound. The lobster can be considered done when its antennae can be easily pulled from the body.
Most of the meat is in the tail and large claws. Additional meat can be found in the smaller legs and near where the legs join the body. The soft white deposits are coagulated protein.

Lobster is often dipped into melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or cocktail sauce. Lobster also goes well with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].

*Side note - The hissing sound while cooking the lobster is not the lobster screaming, but is vapor escaping from under the creature's hard shell.  Some debate arises as to whether the lobster feels any pain.  A CBS news story [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/tech/main673989.shtml ] reported that a group from Norway studied that the lobster's brains are too small to process any feelings of pain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tanzania Top Bar Hives are a style of [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], which design is likely to have originated from [[w:Tanzania| Tanzania]]. The Tanzania Top Bar Hive differentiates itself from the other common design of top bar hive, the [[Beekeeping/Kenya Top Bar Hives| Kenya Top Bar Hive]], because it has non-slanted sides.

==Non Sloped Side==
Some beekeepers who use Top Bar Hives, claim they see no real difference in the functionality of the angled side walls of the hive. The only important point is the opening of the top bar hive in relation to the trough is not convex.

'''Squids''' are cephalopods, related to [[Cookbook:Octopus|octopuses]]. The Italian word for squid, ''calamari,'' is often used to refer to squid in a food context. Calamari can be bought at any sea food corner shop or fresh sea food seller.

It is common to sell the mantle (the hollow, conical-shaped swimming organ) alone, fresh or frozen. Squid are typically white, at least by the time of sale. The swimming organ may be stuffed whole or sliced into rings. The tentacles and legs are also edible.

Ways to serve squid include:

*[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep-fat fried]] in beer batter, plain batter or even crumbed (rings and legs)
*Grilled with or without butter/oil
*[[Cookbook:Stir-fry|Stir-fried]] 
*In an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dish, braised with tomato sauce
*Stuffed with vegetables or spices
*Skewered with wood or bamboo and grilled over flames while brushed with teriyaki sauce

'''Octopuses''' are cephalopods, related to [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]].

It is common to sell octopus whole, frozen into a solid chunk of ice or fresh.
Small octopuses are sometimes served whole or as hand-like halves with about 4 tentacles. Large octopuses may be sliced thin for [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]]. Live octopus is sometimes eaten for the thrill of having the suction cups grab at the eater's mouth.

Ways to serve octopus include:

*Grilled
*[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep-fat fried]] in batter
*[[Cookbook:Stir-fry|Stir-fried]]
*In an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dish, braised with tomato sauce
*[[Cookbook:Sushi|Sushi]]
*[[Cookbook:Barbecue|Barbecued]] (particularly in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]])

'''Scallops''' are shellfish. Normally only a cylindrical part is sold, with the grain running along the axis. Scallops are available in two sizes. Bay scallops are about 1/4&quot; to 5/8&quot; in diameter, and 1/2&quot; to 5/8&quot; in length. Sea scallops are about 1&quot; to 1.6&quot; in diameter, and 1/2&quot; to 5/8&quot; in length. Scallops are usually sold as they thaw out from a frozen state; frosty ones are likely to be fresher. When cooking scallops, remember: Always cook scallops just below done so they don't end up like rubber bands when you eat them due to carry-over.

Bay scallops are commonly used in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]]. Sea scallops are commonly breaded and [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]]. Both kinds are commonly fried in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], perhaps with some [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]].

Recipes using scallops can be found in [[:Category:Scallop recipes]].

{{meat}}

:''Adapted from the public domain USDA article ''[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/focusrabbit.htm Focus on Food Safety of Rabbit]''

Fresh or frozen, '''rabbit''' meat is sold all year round. It can be used in most of the ways in which [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] is used.

Rabbits sold for food in the USA are North American cottontails, crosses between New Zealand and Belgian varieties, Chinese rabbits, or Scottish hares. The meat is fine grained and mild flavored. Like other lean meat, poultry, and fish, rabbit meat is a good source of high quality [[Cookbook:Protein|protein]].  Because the meat is so lean, it is possible to develop a syndrome known as &quot;rabbit starvation&quot; if rabbit is used exclusively as a food over time.  In practice, rabbit starvation is highly unlikely to occur in modern society given the amount of dietary fat consumed by the average person.

==Types of Rabbit Commonly Available== 	

* '''Fryer''' or '''young rabbit''' &amp;mdash; the terms &quot;fryer&quot; or &quot;young rabbit&quot; refer to a rabbit weighing not less than 1 ½ pounds and rarely more than 3 ½ pounds, and less than 12 weeks of age. The flesh is tender, fine grained, and a bright pearly pink color. These rabbits may be cooked in much the same way as young poultry.
* '''Roaster''' or '''mature rabbit''' &amp;mdash; the terms &quot;roaster&quot; or &quot;mature rabbit&quot; refer to a mature rabbit of any weight, but usually over 4 pounds and over 8 months of age. The flesh is firm and coarse grained, and the muscle fiber is slightly darker in color and less tender. The fat may be more creamy in color than that of a fryer or young rabbit. The meat of larger rabbits may be tougher so the best methods of cooking are [[Cookbook:Braising|braising]] or [[Cookbook:Stewing|stewing]].
* '''Giblets'''--the liver and heart, see [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|Organ Meat]].
*'''Wild rabbit''' Has a slightly more gamey taste and is therefore cooked using a few different ingredients and techniques from the farmed rabbits. 

==Inspection==	

In the United States, inspection of rabbit is voluntary. Under voluntary inspection, each rabbit and its internal organs are inspected for signs of disease. The &quot;Inspected for Wholesomeness by USDA&quot; mark of inspection ensures the rabbit is wholesome and free from disease. When a rabbit processor does not produce rabbit meat under FSIS voluntary inspection, they would be subject to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Some states, however, permit the sale of rabbit only if it is inspected under their laws.

The FDA has jurisdiction over the shipment of rabbit meat in interstate commerce.

==Grades==

Rabbit in the US may be graded under the voluntary rabbit grading program performed by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. It provides a national grading service based on official U.S. classes, standards, and grades for poultry.

Rabbit may be graded only if it has been inspected and passed by the FSIS, or inspected and passed by any other inspection system which is acceptable to the USDA, such as state inspection.

Consumer grades for rabbits are U.S. Grade A, U.S. Grade B, and U.S. Grade C.

==Food Safety==
===Safe Storage Times===
Take rabbit home immediately from the grocer and refrigerate at or below 40 °F. Use it within 2 days or freeze at 0 ° F. If kept frozen continuously, it will be safe indefinitely; however, quality will diminish over time. It is safe to freeze rabbit in its original packaging or repackage it for freezing. For best quality, use frozen whole rabbit within a year; pieces within 9 months.

===Safe Thawing===

There are three ways to safely defrost rabbit: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave oven. Never defrost at room temperature.

* Refrigerator: It’s best to plan for slow, safe thawing in the refrigerator. Bone-in parts or whole rabbits may take a day or longer to thaw. Once thawed, rabbit may be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days before cooking. During this time, if you decide not to use the rabbit, you can safely refreeze it without cooking it.
* Cold Water: To defrost rabbit in cold water, do not remove the packaging. Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leak-proof bag. Submerge the rabbit in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so that it continues to thaw. Small packages may defrost in an hour or less; larger packages may take 2 to 3 hours. Plan to cook the rabbit immediately after thawing by the cold water method.
* Microwave oven: When defrosting rabbit in the microwave oven, plan to cook it immediately after thawing because some of the areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook.

===Safe Cooking===

* When roasting rabbit parts, set the oven temperature no lower than 325 °F. A 2-pound, cut-up rabbit should take approximately 1 hour to cook.
* A whole, 2- to 2 1/2-pound rabbit should take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours to roast. Stuffing it will add approximately 1/2 hour to the cooking time.
* Braising rabbit (cooking it in a small amount of liquid in a covered pan on the range or in the oven) also takes about 1 hour. Rabbit can be [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiled]] about 15 minutes on each side.
* For safety, USDA recommends cooking rabbit to an internal temperature of at least 160 °F. The use of a food thermometer is recommended to make sure that your rabbit is safe to eat.
* It is safe to cook frozen rabbit in the oven or on the range or grill without defrosting it first, although the cooking time may be about 50% longer.
* Do not cook frozen rabbit in a slow cooker; thaw first. Cut whole rabbits into smaller pieces so heat can penetrate the meat more quickly.

===Safe Handling of Leftovers===
* Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours after cooking. Use within 3 to 4 days or freeze.
* Use frozen, cooked rabbit within 4 to 6 months for best quality.
* Reheat leftovers to 165 °F.

A '''posset''' is a hot [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] drink, popular in the Middle Ages for its supposed medicinal properties.  Wine or ale was added to the milk, which curdled it, and the mixture was usually spiced.  It was considered a specific remedy for some minor illnesses, such as a cold, and a general remedy for others. Today some people still drink hot milk drinks to help them get to sleep.  A '''caudle''' was a later development that added a thickening agent -- usually some kind of grain (a cereal or &quot;gruel&quot;) but sometimes eggs -- which also increased its nutritional value. Honey, and other sweeteners were later added to the drink.  '''Egg nog''' belongs to the same family of milk punches, however is now often served cold.

The preparation of posset can be elaborate; in fact the word &quot;posset&quot; became a verb (though, now seldom used), meaning to coddle or pamper someone by taking trouble to make them comfortable.

&quot;Posset sets&quot; for mixing and serving possets were popular gifts, and valuable ones (often made of silver) were heirlooms.  Such sets contained a posset &quot;pot&quot;, or &quot;bowl&quot;, or &quot;cup&quot; to serve it in, a container for mixing it in, and usually various containers for the ingredients, as well as spoons.  The one the Spanish ambassador gave Queen Mary I of England and King Philip II of Spain when they became betrothed in 1554 is believed to have been made by Benvenuto Cellini and is of crystal, gold, precious gems, and enamel.  It is on display at Hatfield House in England and consists of a large, stemmed, covered bowl, two open, stemmed vessels, a crystal vase, three spoons, and two forks.

Hey I'm not a huge wikibookian but when I went to this page it said it had been finished, but then when you get there it says that links must be changed? Many people wishing to clear up articles may pass over this one, because it suggests that no work needs doing.
Thanks

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Elements of Communications Theory ==

Communications theory looks at how information is communicated from one place or person to another. This theory looks at the processes involved in transmitting information and how the methods of the transmission will affect the interpretation of the message.

One model of communication that we have is the transmission model of communications. It really is about passing information from one place to another or from one person to another. In this view, communication is how you get information from one place to another. An example of this model is the 1947 Shannon-Weaver general model of communication. The emphasis is on the transmission and reception of information. It proposes that communication is comprised of the following six elements:

#Sources of a Message
#Encoding of a Message
#Transmission of a Message
#Channels of Communication
#Receiving of a Message
#Decoding of a Message


=== Sources of a Message ===

All communication has a source. The source is responsible for sending messages; it always has a purpose for the message. It may be an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization . The thing about senders and receivers are all the complexities of what you think about the message being sent. The characteristics of the message (cultural background, experiential background, and the attitudes and aptitudes of the sender) all help you understand where the message is coming from.


=== Encoding of a Message===

Information must be coded in such a way so it can be received. Encoding is the process of codifying the message to be sent. Most of our messages are put into words. Speaking face-to-face, we use rules of grammar to help us transfer our thoughts to another person or a group of people. However, more and more messages are being put into visuals. We can often represent our ideas without words, e.g. using facial expressions and gestures or by using pictures.

To help understand encoding, consider the way a telephone works. The source, usually a person, speaks into the phone. The phone acts as the encoder, converting the message into electrical signals which can be sent out over the telephone network.


=== Transmission of a Message ===

The message can be transmitted aurally, visually, textually, or by a combination of these mediums. You can decide what method to use, and this will have an impact on the message. The transmitter of a coded message may be speech, printed words, a picture. In the case of the telephone, the trasmitter is the electrical signal sent out by the phone and transmitted to the receiver through a series of electrical connections - a channel for this kind of information.


=== Channels of Communication ===

The channel is the vehicle of message transmission. There can be different types. There is the auditory channel for verbal information; and, a visual channel which uses symbols to convey a message and express ideas. Important issues to consider are how much information someone can handle in single or dual channels, [http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/media/mediarsrch.htm Moore, et. al], an important consideration for multimedia design.


=== Receiving of a Message ===

For communication to occur, there must be somewhere at the end of the channel to receive the message. And the receiver needs to be compatible with the channel and transmission for communication to occur. For example, a televison signal won't work with a telephone receiver. In other words, the receiver is what takes in the message.

=== Decoding of a Message ===

While encoding is all about forming the message, decoding is about figuring out what it says. Of course, all messages are affected by a certain amount of noise. Noise is extraneous and distracting information that inferes with the process of communication. It is any kind of distraction to the receiver that interferes with the transmission of the message such as physical noise, emotions, and visual distractions. It is often thought of as a problem with transmission, e.g., electrical interference with a television signal; or, several people talking at once. However, there may be noise in the message itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==

Gendered images have been effective in perpetuating both the positive and negative connotations that we associate with gender.  The history of promotional images, along with the visual rhetoric of advertising sheds light on how the constructs of masculinity and femininity contextualize fabrications of social role, power, status and sexual allure.  Specifically, appeals of glamour and the usage of nature images powerfully contribute to the influx of image-based advertising based on gender identification.  Additionally, childhood gender development contributes enormously to stereotypes regarding masculinity and femininity.

== '''History of Gendered Images''' ==

Historically, the nudes of European oil paintings portray women and men differently, in specific roles and purposes.  Traditionally, women have been seen and judged as sights, while men act as spectators.  In other words, women appear while men act.  John Berger suggests in his work, ''Ways of Seeing,'' that this affects relations between men and women and also the relations of women to themselves.  The renowned painting of Adam and Eve was groundbreaking in introducing the concept of nakedness in regard to women being seen as submissive to men.  “… the woman is blamed and is punished by being made subservient to the man.  In relation to the woman, the man becomes the agent of God” (Berger 48).  As paintings became more worldly and had fewer religious undertones, the common denominator remained women illustrated as being seen by a spectator.  “She is not naked as she is; she is naked as the spectator sees her” (Berger 50).  

The facial expressions of women in images also coincides with the notion that they submit to being surveyed.  Berger suggests that in poses of women, a woman’s gaze and facial expression sells her femininity.  Paintings and photographs often depict this by showing the woman looking over her shoulder at the viewer, rather than at the male shown in the painting or photograph.   

While these attitudes and ideals regarding the portrayal of women are rampant in photographs and paintings, it has also seeped into popular culture, disseminating into various media, including current advertising, journalism and television.  

== '''Identification and Advertising''' ==

Identification fulfills an essential role as it allows advertisers to appeal to each viewer’s individuality. In the article, &quot;Defining Film Rhetoric: The Case of Hitchcock’s Vertigo,&quot; David Blakesley introduces the idea of identification as he describes the notion as longing to find similitude between ones self and a particular idea, picture, object, etc. He explains, “we pursue that identification as one way of expressing…pushed to its extreme, we desire to become the other, to inhabit that psychological and physical space, to take ownership of some kind, to walk in someone else’s shoes for awhile” (Blakesley 117). As a result of such desire for identification, women and men are often characterized in a generalized manner, only to appeal to their own gender-specific identify.

Diane S. Hope suggests, in her chapter &quot;Gendered Environments: Gender and the Natural World in the  Rhetoric of Advertising&quot; from the book, ''Defining Visual Rhetorics,'' that advertising demonstrates and perpetuates gender-specific attributes of men and women in order to identify with their gender-specific audiences. Hope comments, “visual rhetoric depends on strategies of identification; advertising’s rhetoric is dominated by appeals to gender as the primary marker of consumer identity.  Constructs of masculinity or femininity contextualize fantasies of social role, power, status, and security as well as sexual attractiveness” (155).  Within the visual realm of advertising Hope observes how women are often depicted in a way that promotes beauty, fertility and sexuality while men possess more ‘masculine’ attributes.  Contrary to feminine traits, masculine attributes include strength, adventurous nature, and physical prowess.

Although many of these characteristics and behavioral tendencies are thought to be innate, the advertising industry reintroduces and reiterates such gender roles as the norm.  People become conditioned to believe that there are specific and isolated behavioral differences and attributes that define us either as men or women.  Such differences have gone beyond the obvious physiological makeup that separates male from female.

==='''''Glamour'''''===

Societal roles based on one's gender are defined and controlled by culture and have been reiterated through visual means.  See [[Visual Rhetoric/Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric]]. Such gender roles are especially evident within the visual realm of advertising. Advertisers use visual means to communicate to their viewers feminine and masculine ideals.  These gendered ideals are closely linked to the concepts of envy and glamour.  “Publicity persuades us of a transformation by showing us people who have apparently been transformed and are, as a result, enviable.  The state of being envied is what constitutes glamour” (Berger 131).  Predominantly, glamour is a tool used by advertisers and aimed at men and women in an effort to increase consumerism.  The language of publicity harps upon the concept of a spectator-buyer imagining himself or herself transformed by a product, and thus an object of envy by others.  People crave envy, and this advertising tactic is aimed at both men and women to create consumption of various products.  Women are generally persuaded when glamour is presented as enhancing to their lives by making them more beautiful or desirable.  Alternatively, men are influenced by ads that appeal to their desire to be in power and in control.

==='''''Childhood Gender Development'''''===

Advertisers create ‘gendered environments’ in everything from children’s toys to motor vehicles. For example, early on children are exposed to toy commercials that are set out to target a specific gender.  As a result, society is conditioned to believe that dolls and houses are for little girls because they represent the idea that females are to be fertile and nurturing.  Whereas little boys are conditioned to believe that they can only play with toys that will define their masculinity, such as cars and toy weapons.  Hope says, “masculinized environments present a natural world made for conquest and control” (174).  Much like the masculine ideal, toys for little boys often include cars, action figures, and sporting goods, all which fulfill the idea of a conquest. These items and the advertisements redefine the gender role ideal that men are active, strong, and courageous. On the other hand, little girls are raised to believe that their roles is to care for the family.  Typically, little girls toys include baby dolls and play houses.  

Since the idea of identification carries immense weight in the targeting of specific audiences, advertisers begin promoting the concept of gendered environments early on beginning with children's toys.  However, as people grow older the gender roles are only made more evident and are further perpetuated in advertising that is targeted towards adults.  For example, Hope discusses how the advertising of sport utility vehicles is a primary example of the gender role divide. She talks about how an SUV reiterates the idea that men are conquerors of territory and must have a powerful vehicle to traverse through their difficult journeys. She describes the more ‘masculine’ advertisements as a place where man can conquer land and explore the vast wilderness. She states, “the features of these advertisements emphasize a mythic world where men play [as] heroics and a vast environmental wilderness promises control and adventure” (161).
  
==='''''Nature images'''''===

Hope analyzes the characteristics of the specific visual environments that promote the sales of such masculine or feminine products. She concludes that advertisers use certain natural environments within a commercial or print ad in order to appeal to a specific gender. She observes in one advertisement how femininity is characterized using a picture of a waterfall.  Hope explains that the waterfall acts as, “a sign of nature’s unending fertility…images are exotic and lush with icons of fertility and female sexuality” (157). In such advertisements women are one with nature.  Advertisers also use specific natural environments to appeal to males.  However, these images depict a sense of acquisition unseen in feminine advertisements.  Hope suggests that for men &quot;nature is the object of conquest or background for demonstrations of power.&quot; &quot;... there are no environmental problems in this space or in the fertile seas of feminized lands, there is only opportunity to consume&quot; (Hope 162).  She observes in one advertisement how masculinity is distinguished using the image of &quot;Marlboro Country&quot;.  In Marlboro Country, men are free from responsibility and routine. In one particular ad, two cowboys are depicted riding wild horses.  The mystical west is perceived as for &quot;real&quot; men (Hope 160).  &quot; . excepting the occasional cowboy or Indian, the space is there for urban man to play at adventure&quot; (Hope 161).

[[Image:Marlboroman.jpg]]

Ultimately, Hope articulates, “advertising appropriates a rich visual history of nature images as sites of femininity and masculinity in order to sell commodities&quot; (Hope 173).  Through the use of visual rhetoric and the natural world, gender specific behaviors are promoted to appeal either to both genders.  The existence of gender roles and gender identity through images will continue to be present in the future of advertising.

== '''Conclusion''' ==
Gendered images are omnipresent in modern society.  Understanding the history of these images is important in understanding how they are capable of persuading us.  Gendered images are considered rhetorical because they have a persuasive quality.  It is important to remember that since birth, we have been conditioned to make the distinction between men and women, masculinity and femininity, and to recognize both the positive and negative aspects of

''A class in PHP is a group of related functions, also known as an object.'' I have changed this because an object is not a class, its an instance of a class. So I changed it to ''A class in PHP is a group of related functions''.--[[User:Seanor|Seanor]] 16:20, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== PHP 5 vs. PHP 4 ==
I'm a bit too new to all of this (php &amp; wikipedia) to know for sure, but I believe the example is only good for PHP version 5.  There are a lot of servers still running PHP 4.  The difference, as I understand it, is that in PHP 4 you may not distinguish between public, private, and protected data.  Perhaps someone with more knowledge/experience can shed some light on the subject.  more information is available on php.net http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop.php &amp; http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php

      <text xml:space="preserve">While the sphere of visual rhetoric is till being explored, an aspect of it is often neglected.  Much of the field’s focus is on the two dimensional image.  It is still a new area of study that is being analyzed.  See [[../Definitions of Visual Rhetoric|Definitions of Visual Rhetoric]] for more.  Whether it be a painting, a film, or a picture, all three are limited to the dimensions of height and length.  Even though the third dimension is often neglected, it is still very important to understand its functions in visual rhetoric and the differences that arise when compared to two-dimensional objects.  Perspective, modality, and composition or spatiality are three factors that need to be analyzed when discussing the two.  Perspective deals with the angles that the audience can view the work.  Modality is an important issue to discuss when analyzing the two.  Modality relates to the realness of an image of an object and how much truth it portrays.  For example, a picture has high modality when the saturation, depth, brightness, etc., are at a level gives the picture the highest level of realism (Kress and van Leeuwen 160-161).  Composition and spatiality are how the artist uses the frame or space, respectively, to build persuasion. 

As an observer, for the most part, a two-dimensional image is viewed from one perspective, straightforward.  With no depth to the image, seeing it at an angle will not change the perspective of the composition.  What can affect the persuasiveness of the image is the distance at which it is viewed.  A prime example is Monet’s impressionistic paintings.  Up close, the brush strokes seem blotchy; however, at a distance, the paintings appear to be a wonderful image of nature.

[[File:Claude Monet - Twilight, Venice.jpg|250px|left]]

Unlike two-dimensional images, three-dimensional objects can be seen from multiple perspectives.  We can walk around it and interact with its setting.  The angle that we look at an object also has an effect on its persuasiveness.  When something is placed at eye level, we see it with a sense of equality or welcoming.  However when it is placed above eye level and overlooks the audience, there is a sense of dominance and importance.  For example, bronze and iron statues of significant individuals are always elevated to appear almost godlike.  

Modality is another aspect that must be investigated when analyzing the two.  Much praise is bestowed upon an artist when an image has high modality.  Recreating an image that appears almost lifelike takes such skill and technique that few possess.  Artists like Rembrandt are incredible and admired for that reason.  The same goes for photography.  While photography in itself is the replication of nature, it still is a task to make that image appear more vivid.  Adjustments must be made to shutter speed, lenses, and the like. Saturating a picture can overly enhance its colors and make it too vivid.  There is a fine balance to expressing the truth of an image.   

The modality of three-dimensional objects is something that needs to be addressed with concern.  Making an object with depth more vivid is unsettling.  When something takes up space, it has an automatic sense of realness to it.  Sculptures of humans for example, almost need an abstract quality to be seen with comfort.  Wax museums are a great example.  These are recreations of human beings to look as lifelike as possible.  While it is amazing to see something fake look so real, having the facial features be so vivid, the audience gets a sense of being watched and anxiety when being around many of them.  For this reason, they lose part of their persuasiveness of engaging the viewer by the created anxiety (Kress and van Leeuwen 243).  

[[Image:stare2d.jpg|250px|left|Claire's Knee]]

The added dimension of depth separates the two in the sense of composition and spatiality.  Composition is the arrangement of the elements of an image within the frame.  They direct the eye as to where to look and give the image meaning.  More can be read about this in [[Rhetorical Vectors]].  I argue that three dimensional objects do not have composition, as much as they do spatiality.  How an image takes up space directs our eyes and gives it meaning.  A great deal of artist’s ability to persuade the audience with images is how to arrange the frame.  Figure 2.21, (&quot;Claire’s Knee,&quot; left), from ''Reading Images'' is a particular example.  The photographer arranged the three individuals within the composition to give it more fluidity and more meaning.  

[[Image:family3d.jpg|250px|thumb|Figure 8.13: Family Romance]] Figure 8.13  (&quot;Family Romance,&quot; right) from ''Reading Images'' illustrates the concept of spatiality in three-dimensional objects.  It is an example of how an artist can utilize space has an added aspect to give meaning.  The artist is not just arranging the images within a frame, but analyzing how to represent space as well.  The family’s persuasiveness is the manipulation of the audience’s preconceptions of a family.  Having each member be the same size, gives the sculpture more meaning.  

Other examples of spatiality exist in more practical settings.  Much thought is put into the planning of interior design for buildings.  In their article “Placing Visual Rhetoric: Finding Material Comfort in Wild Oats Market,&quot; Greg Dickinson and Casey Malone Maugh discuss the rhetoric in the design of Wild Oats Market organic food stores.  The stores are designed and arrange to make the customers feel more at home and not aware of the feeling of impending globalization that is projected at other big chain groceries.   The spatial arrangement of specific objects gives the store more or a persuasive nature.  With images, the composition is seen all at once.  However, in this sense, one has to interact with the “display” to perceive its persuasiveness.  

There is still much to be explored in the realm of visual rhetoric.  Books are written specifically about two-dimensional images; so the third dimension has much time before it is extensively analyzed.  While some aspects like materials are similar between two-dimensional images and three-dimensional objects, several differences in regards to persuasiveness exist.  The perspective, modality, and composition or spatiality are all used differently among the two.  Images have the capability to be seen at once without having to move to different angles, and are praised for their realism.  Objects need to be interacted with from multiple perspectives and usually create apprehension with the viewer when it appears too real.  The third dimension is something that needs to be explored because it is highly persuasive, and as observed with the Wild Oats Market example, we sometimes are not even aware of such rhetorical displays.

But at least start with some savings plan.  Apply the philosophy, '''''invest as much as you can as early as you can'''''.  As one begins to save, the decision of what to do with the money becomes a challenge.  Since different industries, market sectors, and asset classes perform at different levels during various market cycles, it behooves one to diversify investments over a variety of asset classes.  Establishing an asset allocation plan for a portfolio is an important first step toward successful investing.  Below are some guidelines and helpful hints.


'''1.0    Asset Allocation'''
# Determine an overall plan for a broad portfolio establishing percentage guidelines for each asset class. An example portfolio is available at [http://www.bivio.com/bullrun/files/Asset%20Allocation] Look for the  Sample.xls file. A more complex asset allocation spreadsheet is available on this same site. Look for the file AA-01-15-2005.xls.
# Divide the portfolio into growth and value investments.  Use Morningstar guidelines.  In some cases the investment will fall into what is known as a core investment or somewhere between a value and growth investment.
# Divide the portfolio into large, mid, and small-cap size. Some investors will prefer to use sales as the division points.  Again, use Morningstar guidelines.
# Determine if the portfolio should include asset classes such as REITs, international, emerging markets, precious metals, bonds, etc.

The reasons or logic for developing a portfolio strategy is based on research done by Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood and Gilbert L. Beebower in their ground breaking paper, &quot;Determinants of Portfolio Performance.&quot; Brinson, Brian D. Singer and Beebower followed with an update of the original paper in 1991.  John Nuttall provides counter arguments to the Brinson et. al. papers in his article, &quot;The Importance of Asset Allocation.&quot;  To be sure, Brinson is frequently misquoted.

Ronald J. Surz, Dale Stevens, and Mark Wimer in their article, &quot;Investment Policy Explains All&quot; write, &quot;For those who thought that the question of policy importance had been conclusively asked and answered by the authors' (Brinson et. al.) study, we now say it wasn't.  The critics' arguments do contain some truth -- and some errors.  Investment policy is not only the most important contributor to performance -- it is even more important than originally thought.&quot;  

Later in the Surz et. al. article they write, &quot;...this means that investment policy explains 112% of the performance of the average fund in the authors' study, a far greater number than originally suggested.&quot;

Several additional references advocating a well-developed portfolio can be found in the following books.
&quot;Four Pillars of Investing&quot; - William Bernstein
&quot;The Intelligent Asset Allocator&quot; - William Bernstein
&quot;Asset Allocation: Balancing Financial Risk&quot; - Roger C. Gibson

'''2.0    Active Asset Allocation'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''4.0    Maintaining a &quot;Watch List&quot; of Stocks'''

A &quot;Watch List&quot; consists of a group of stocks an investor finds of interest but as yet does not own. It is certainly possible to expand the &quot;Watch List&quot; to include stocks owned so one can compare quality and price between owned and &quot;under-the-microscope&quot; or stocks to watch.

Just what information to include in a &quot;Watch List&quot; is up to the investor.  Some suggestions as to what to include include all the fundamental SSG factors such as expected growth in sales and earnings, direction of management controls found in Section 2 of the SSG, Total Return, Relative Value, and the Upside/Downside ratio.  Information gleaned from Value Line could include Operating Margins, Return on Share Equity, and Price/Book ratio.  Using Value Line one can calculate PEG and the Robertson Quality Rating (RQR) value.

'''Templates''' (or skins) are the '''set of directory and files''' (icons, .html and .css). definition of the way the mambo-interface - that is your site, explained in normal terms - will look. They are highly configurable, and can be used in many different ways.

The templates are acting exactly the same as a ''skins''. The templates are predefined looks (designs), which make mambo look a certain way (color patterns, icons for navigation, etc...). The templates do not control the behavior, though, as in other systems that use templates - it is a look-only definition.

Explained very simply, a template is a HTML/CSS document that has code in it which makes it compatible with mambo. For example, there are code for loading the modules of a certain position, there are code to load the main body (main content) and so on.

''see: [[Mambo Open Source/Create your own template|Create your own template]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is very old and the links no longer work. Mambelfish has been abandoned and has not been developed since 2005.

{{MAMBOTOC}}

The components are supplements and additions to mambo's core functions. Mambo can publish text, upload images, manage users, etc., but components are extra functions that can perform additional tasks. Examples of these are: download managers, forums, commerce, galleries, guestbooks, wikis, newsletters - the list is almost endless.

These components are installed with an installer in mambo, found under '''&quot;components &gt; install/uninstall&quot;''' in the mambo administration panel. This is how most of the components are installed, but it should be noted that some of them will need modification to core files. However, that is very seldom needed, as the components installer is usually sufficient.

==Example==

==Complete list of ''components''==
* see.. [http://mamboforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=328 Components (more than 322 projects)]

===Mambelfish===

The '''MambelFish''' project is a extention hack and ''component'' for the content management system Mambo. It enables Mambo to handle multi lingual sites especially in all dynamic contents which are stored in the database.

;The key features of the fish are
* Possibility for an unlimited amount of languages
* Possibility to MANUAL translate all dynamic content of your Mambo installation in ONE database
* Overview of the changed contents in the Translation list
* Support for all the core components/modules of Mambo's
* Frontend component for language selection

The MambelFish project is maintained and hosted on Mambo's project forge http://mamboforge.net/projects/mambelfish/ by  author Alex Kempkens &lt;MambelFish (at) ThinkNetwork (dot) com&gt; , Copyright (C) 2003-2005 Think Network GmbH. When ever you have questions or new ideas please visit this page and post your comments there.

====Installation====

The basic installation of the MambelFish goes along with the Mambo (version 4.5.2.3) standards.

1. Install the component thru the Administrator -&gt; Components -&gt; Install routine.&lt;BR&gt;
1.a) start in the ''backend'' to install mambelfish:&lt;BR&gt;
1.b) file 'Mambelfish_1.5.zip' with the component installer&lt;BR&gt;
1.c) file 'Mbf_module.zip' with the module installer&lt;BR&gt;
1.d) file 'Mbf_searchbot.zip' with the mambot installer&lt;BR&gt;
2. Now the difference starts: Applying the corresponding patch.&lt;BR&gt;
2.a) BACKUP YOUR ACTUAL MAMBO INSTALLATION DIRECTORY!&lt;BR&gt;
2.b) MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP THE DIRECTORY&lt;BR&gt;
2.c) The patch is a zip file which corresponds with the directory structure of the Mambo sources. Please unzip (''how-with ftp?'') the latest known ''corepatch 4.5.2'' file from [http://mamboforge.net/projects/mambelfish/ mamboforge] to the root of your Mambo installation, overwriting all files.

For a simple test please switch to the peeklime template. Within this template you should see a combobox with the language name &quot;English&quot; in it - next to the search field (upper right part). Also in the Administrator the Version should now say something about the MambelFish.

====Language configuration====
The first step is to upload at least a second language to your Mambo installation. Do this with the help of the Language Manager (Administrator -&gt; Site -&gt; Language Manager).

After you installed the language go to Administrator -&gt; Components -&gt; MambelFish -&gt; Component Configuration

Choose the tab &quot;Languages&quot; and activate the new language. Also define the ISO code and the Name, which is the visible name in the frontend component. Save the new configuration.

This kind of activation must be done for each language added to the system.

====Translation process====

The translation process is based on the translation overview (Component -&gt; MambelFish -&gt; Translation). In this overview you have to select the language you want to translate into and a content element.

The content elements represent the possible dynamic content in your database. This includes normally all your sections, categories, content items but also the information from other components, like the web links, polls and so on.

It is possible to add new content elements just by adding new XML files in the  folder ''/administrator/components/com_mambelfish/contentelements''. These files describe how the table structure is organized and which fields of the table should be translatable and how.

After you selected one language and one content element you will see all the items of this filter. Best start with your new language and the content elements &quot;menues&quot;. Click on one item in the list to translate it.

Now you see the details of the translation - go ahead. Second tab publish the translation of this item and make sure the language is correct - Save.

Now you can go back to the frontend and you should already find your menu translated (of course after a reload or change to your new language ;-)).

====Small hints====
*I found out that it is the best to start creating your site in one language and translate anything to a second, third one. In this way it is most easy for you to build the structure and finally translate it to the other languages. Anyhow if you once have a original content in a second language don't worry, just translate it into your primary language and you are fine.

*The language switcher appears when you add &lt;?php mosLoadComponent( 'mambelfish' );?&gt; 
at the place where you wish in your template.

* You can also just use the module (if you have installed it) and place it at any module position that you like (and that you have published) - but as far as I know the module just uses the Component ;-) 

* about the languages, that don't change... have you checked the URL? at the end there should be the parameter lang=XX ... if you see only 'lang=' and nothing more you just have to type an identification code of the languages in your mambelfish configuration [components-mambelfish-language configuration] 

* checke Your language configuration in the Mambo Backend ''(Components &gt; Mambelfish &gt; Language Configuration)''

Modules are the sideblocks in mambo. 

Mambo has predefined positions for these modules. The most common are the left and right positions. The designer of a template (see below) can place these positions wherever he/she wants, so there is no rule that says the left position will be on the left of the template. But templates are commonly set up so that this corresponds to the actual layout.

There are also more module positions. There are top positions, which are usually over both left and right modules, and also content. This position is good for [[Mambo Open Source/Newsflash|newsflashes]] etc. There are many more positions to choose from, and one can create as many as one likes - you can have 30 different positions if you want to (see picture...[[Mambo Open Source/Modules positions]] ).

==Example==

==Complete list of ''modules''==
Amongst these are:
* main menu module, 
* login, 
* poll, 
* syndicate - all the stuff around the content.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Like many of the earliest virus, it is evident from the code that Brain (brain.dos.x) 
does not utilise any inherent system vulnerabilities to spread. 
Its spreading is purely dependent on well documented function calls(interrupts).

==Source Code==
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

; This is the ashar variant of the classic Pakistani Brain virus. It is large
; by today's standards, although it was one of the first.  It is a floppy only
; boot sector infector.

== Convert templates from 4.5 to 4.5.x ==

A mambo template uses variables and operators in the Mambo core system, and some of these may change during the development of Mambo. Most templates created for version 4.5 of Mambo will work with the newer versions of 4.5.x, but there are some precautions to be aware of.

A 4.5.x compatible template will be 100% compatible with the future release of version 5.0.  4.5.x also has some functions that 4.5 templates doesn't, like the top-menu.

== How to upgrade ==


===Pathway===

In 4.5 the pathway was a reference to a file called &quot;pathway.php&quot;. 4.5.x is different here, and uses a function called &quot;mosPathWay&quot;.

{|cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot; |4.5 
!width=&quot;50%&quot; |4.5.x

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php include_once(&quot;pathway.php&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php mosPathWay(); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|}

===Mainbody===


In 4.5 the mainbody was a reference to a file called &quot;mainbody.php&quot;. 4.5.x is different here, and uses a function called &quot;mosMainBody&quot;.

{|cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5 
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5.x

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php include_once(&quot;mainbody.php&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php mosMainBody(); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|}

===Global variables===

Some of the core config-variables have changed too, here they are:

{|cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5 
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5.x

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_live_site&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_live_site']&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_absolute_path&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_absolute_path']&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_sitename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_sitename']&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_offset&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_offset']&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|}


===Pathway-separator===

4.5.x has a new feature for the pathway arrow. In the Mambo generated pathway of the &quot;mosPathWay&quot;-function, an arrow image appears between the pathway links. This can be a custom arrow for each template, and it is very simple to use this feature.

Simply create an image that you want for this, save it in .png-format, call it &quot;arrow.png&quot; and place it in the root folder of the template you want it in, the same as the &quot;template_details.xml&quot; and &quot;index.php&quot; files.  If this doesn't work, try putting it in the images sub-folder.  What the heck, put it in both places.

Remember to create a reference to this file in the &quot;template_details.xml&quot; file, so that it is uploaded when installing the template through the Mambo Template Installer.

===The head code===

The head code has also been upgraded from 4.5. 

If you don't use any custom functions and includes in the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, use this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
/**
* Here you can writes notes about the template
* It has no technical effect, It is merely for
* information purposes.
*/
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or die( 'Direct Access to this location is not allowed.' );
$iso = split( '=', _ISO );
echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;'. $iso[1] .'&quot;?' .'&gt;';
?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;?php if ( $my-&gt;id ) initEditor(); ?&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; &lt;?php echo _ISO; ?&gt;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;?php mosShowHead(); ?&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;&lt;?php echo $GLOBALS['mosConfig_live_site']; ?&gt;/templates/yourtemplatesname/css/template_css.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

Elk Cloner is the first known computer virus to spread in the wild. It infected Apple II systems and was written by Richard Skrenta in 1982. It spread by infecting Apple II floppy disks. It did not cause any intentional harm to data, and displayed the message on every 50th booting.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
  Elk Cloner:  The program with a personality
 
  It will get on all your disks
    It will infiltrate your chips
      Yes it's Cloner!

  It will stick to you like glue
    It will modify ram too
      Send in the Cloner!
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What are templates? ==

Templates allow you to define the look for your Mambo website. They are highly configurable, and can be used in many different ways. You can have more than one template in use on your site at a time. Additional templates can be completely different or subtle variations of each other, such as disabling Modules within particular areas of your Mambo website. 


=== How do they work? ===

The templates are html and css documents. They are just like any other css or html document, only that instead of content written directly into them, you place variables such as &quot;main content here&quot;, &quot;left modules here&quot;, &quot;banners here&quot; and so on. 

This means that you use Mambo to manage the content, and Mambo places the content the way you have specified within the template. Now you can easily change layout of a site, without having to do anything with the content itself. Mambo will just place the content in the variables you have defined in the new template as if nothing have happened.

On the other hand, this doesn't mean that you only can customize the elements around the content. Mambo fills the content with CSS-IDs and classes, so that you can use these tools to make the template decide which color and fonts and point sizes page elements should have. The behaviour and style of the menus, the margins between content images and text and a variety of other presentation decisions can be controlled by the template.

This is an example layout of a Mambo-template:


{| width=&quot;500&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| height=&quot;50&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | SITE NAME 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Pathway/breadcrumb
|- 
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Left modules 
| width=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot; | &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More main content  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Right modules 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Footer with copyright info 
|}


This is the layout template, and Mambo fills in the appropriate content where you define it to, as shown in this example.

===Why templates?===

The most noticeable advantage of the template system is the flexibility. If you have a regular static HTML-site and want to change the menu, you'll have to manually change this on every page on your site where your menu is shown. With Mambo (and all other template-systems), you only need to modify your template, and this will apply to every single page on your site - because of that the template only echo the content that Mambo creates. This saves you a lot of work, and is a very big advantage for designers and developers.</text>

== German Mambo-Wikibook ==

We have a German Mambo-Wikibook, too!

Have a look at http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mambo

:''Thanks for letting us know!'' --August 10:54, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== TOC, version issues &amp; categories ==

Hi, I'm thinking about: 
:1) one full TOC for all articles about MOS here, and
:2)''help'' relation to ''versions''. For now it's not clear on what version of MOS (4.5,... 5.0,... ) installing/setting/tweaking articles are?

Should we need some categories system? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 10:45, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

according to rules, at least one category must be assigned :-), but the real reason is to create ''one flat browsable table of content'' ... so maybe 
: - [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Category:MOS]] is OK, but where in: [[:Category:Computing]] {{bad link|Category:How-tos}} [[:Category:Information technology|Category:Information Technology]] 
: - another ''trick'' is to use ''piped link'', such as ''Category:MOS|1'' to create and see some kind of workflow in categories page [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Category:MOS]] ?
: - is it possible to put &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MOS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; into [[Template:MAMBOTOC]] so, that Category will be assigned to every article ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 11:17, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: hope created not a big mess? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 11:43, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: I added the MOS category into the [[Template:MAMBOTOC_SMALL]] template. Now, the MOS category is automatically set on every article, as that template is mandatory for all articles in this book. --August 15:41, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: congr.nicesolution --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 19:09, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== A new chapter: configuration ==

What do you guys think of adding another chapter called &quot;configuration&quot;? This could prove useful, as there are many of these types of articles that will be placed under the miscellaneous-chapter. --August 15:37, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Let's make all this book like step_by_step instruction. Also I suggest to emphasise '''steps''' and '''links to the info''' with comments from our practice or forums, because even for two of us wouldn't be ease to put/edit all info in time to new versions...? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 19:36, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I didn't understand any of that.. Can you explain again? And do you have MSN or skype? Lot easier to contact there. --August 22:19, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: Here will be more ease to explain... For now it's not clear for me ''the purpose and audience'' of this wiki-book. For now Official Mambo Help is not good. Lot of info is spreed in forums. I think it could be good guide through the all steps, needed to be performed while installing and configuring site from zero. --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 22:46, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::: What do you mean with &quot;needed to be perfomed while installing and configuring site from zero&quot;? If you write articles as unclear as you write here, i am getting a little scared.. --August 22:53, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: Please discuss 'subject of matter'. First please answer: ''the purpose and audience'' of this wiki-book? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 10:04, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Well, the purpose is to inform and educate in mambo, the audience is everybody from beginner to pro. --August 10:55, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: :-))) Sorry (for future didactics), but those words means almost nothing (from the point of communication/education theory). I still miss some fundamentals in structure of this ''source of knowledge about MOS''...
::: '''For example 1):''' there are ''objects'' (unfortunately without articles or links to primary source of info: [[Mambo Open Source/Components|Components]], [[Mambo Open Source/Modules|Modules]], [[Mambo Open Source/Templates|Templates]], [[Mambo Open Source/Mambots|Mambots]] ...) and ''functions'' they carry also ''activities'' which could be neccessary to know ''how_to_perform'' ([[Mambo Open Source/Create]], Install, Add, Edit, Config, Settings... Examples of use, Syntax is...) so articles and categories and TOC must help to quickly find things of interest. [[Mambo Open Source/How do i fix that|How do i fix that]] must be only article some kind of TOC redirecting to [[Mambo Open Source/Frontpage|Frontpage]] with the section ''settings'', not talking/explaining ''frontpage settings''.
:::'''For example 2):''' &lt;nowiki&gt;MAMBOTOC and {{MAMBOTOC SMALL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; are ''eyes-popping'', but without explanation ''where_which_to_use'' and not much of use - when we are in article it's not clear ''where we are''. I still suggest to think about one flat TOC, for example as ''Wikipedia Community Portal''... --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 8 July 2005 15:37 (UTC)

:As i have so far been the only major contributor to this book, i have not set up those kind of goals. My only goal have been to write down as clear as i could what i know about mambo. I don't think that the book should exclude content because of some rules set up, but i do agree that the organizing of the content is a key element. I will think about this and try to come to a conclusion of what the best way of organizing stuff is.

:And another thing: the guidelines you mention (objects, functions etc) are things that i am 100% aware of, and i think that i have used that knowledge in my articles so far. Such guidelines would not be of use to me, as i am aware of it, but only useful for people who don't understand mambo that well - and why should those contribute to the book?

:--August 9 July 2005 01:14 (UTC)

==Manually inserted categories==
ok.. as I understood You did book for yourself, then ''some bad boy came... and the hell started'' :-))) , so '''For example 3):''' there are ''Cat..:'' included in ''Templ..:'', but life shows that it's not good - when we are in the [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Category:MOS]] we see ''Pages in category &quot;MOS&quot;'' all of them starting with '''M'''... :-( . We can try to fix like this (manually entering piped link) ''Category:MOS|Frontpage'' as i did in [[Mambo Open Source/Frontpage]] ... but '''Mambo Open Source/...''' remains in the Title :-((( --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 21:34, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

:I am aware of this, but don't think that it is important at all. People should browse the book by the tocs created in the book, and not the category pages.

::Who told that :-))) ? As far as I know&amp;understand Wiki - ''Categories system'' was created to automatically create/maintain lists (let's say ''Indexes'' as in books). TOC's also are automatically generated at the article's page :-))) So - why You like ''manual (hand) work'' ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 18:31, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] ==

Should article titles &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name:Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; must be renamed instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name/Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 00:30, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:That is correct, the names should be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Mambo Open Soure/Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

== Multilanguage ==

Hi, I think [[Mambo Open Source/Multilanguage]] is needed to explain how to setup more than one language, also description of  ''[[Mambo Open Source/Components]]'' (and others) '''Mambelfish''' section (or article?) somewhere must find place. What You think? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 19:17, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:I really think that there are other subjects than multilanguage that is important. I will prioritize the management of content and noob guides --August 22:13, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

::I don;t understand what mean ''to prioritize the management of content'' ? Please specify ''other subjects that is important&quot; ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 13:38, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

This article is a tutorial on how to create a template from scratch.

[[Mambo Open Source/Templates|Templates]] are located in the directory '''/mambo_dir/templates''' . The following is a 
typical structure for a template directory:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;/templates
 /basic_template
  /css
   template_css.css
  /images
  index.php
  template_thumbnail.png
  templateDetails.xml&lt;/pre&gt;

where each file is for:
;index.php : template layout file. 
;template_css.css : css stylesheet for the template. 
;templateDetails.xml : metadata file in XML format. 
;template_thumbnail.png : reduced screenshot of the template (140px wide x 90px high)

To make a template this is the minimum set of files needed. The ''core script'' of MOS expects these files names. Note that while there are no images shown in the /images directory, this is typically where you would place any supporting images for your template, like backgrounds, banners, etc. 

== Create the files ==

Some basic files are needed for a mambo template to function properly.

Begin with creating a folder for your template in your sites templates-directory. Call it something appropriate, e.g. &quot;myfirst&quot; or &quot;corporate_yellow&quot; (anything goes), and open it. This is the root folder of your template.

===templateDetails.xml===

Then create a file called &quot;templateDetails.xml&quot;. This file contains all technical info about your template, and should look something like this for now (it will be expanded later):

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;mosinstall type=&quot;template&quot;&gt;
	&lt;name&gt;Myfirst&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;creationDate&gt;16/04/2005&lt;/creationDate&gt;
	&lt;author&gt;Your name&lt;/author&gt;
	&lt;copyright&gt;GPL&lt;/copyright&gt;
	&lt;authorEmail&gt;mail@something.com&lt;/authorEmail&gt;
	&lt;authorUrl&gt;www.yourhomepage.com&lt;/authorUrl&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;description&gt;A little description.&lt;/description&gt;
	&lt;files&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;index.php&lt;/filename&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;template_thumbnail.png&lt;/filename&gt;
	&lt;/files&gt;
	&lt;images&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;images/image.gif&lt;/filename&gt;
	&lt;/images&gt;
	&lt;css&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;css/template_css.css&lt;/filename&gt;
	&lt;/css&gt;
&lt;/mosinstall&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This file is the reference for Mambo, and shows the name of the template and the name of all the other files. As you can see, there are references to a php-file, some images and a CSS-file.

Not all fields here are required, but use as many of them as you can.

===Index.php===
Now, you can start with the index.php-file. This is where you shall place all HTML code and this will be the template's main source of output. Create the file called index.php and open it. This is the basic content of the file which is required for Mambo operation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or die( 'Direct Access to this location is not allowed.' );
$iso = split( '=', _ISO );
echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;'. $iso[1] .'&quot;?' .'&gt;';
?&gt;

&lt;?php if ( $my-&gt;id ) initEditor(); ?&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; &lt;?php echo _ISO; ?&gt;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;?php mosShowHead(); ?&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;&lt;?php echo $GLOBALS['mosConfig_live_site']; ?&gt;/templates/yourtemplatesname/css/template_css.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As I assume you know basic HTML, you should know that the content and the template itself is to be placed in the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags of the template. Here you can use whatever method you like for content organization, e.g., div-tags or tables. I'll use tables in this example.

This is my planned layout:


{| width=&quot;500&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| height=&quot;50&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | SITE NAME 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Pathway/breadcrumb
|- 
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Left modules 
| width=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot; | &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More main content  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Right modules 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Footer with copyright info 
|}

This is the HTML code for this layout to be placed in the body-tags:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;700&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td height=&quot;50&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;SITE NAME &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Pathway/breadcrumb&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;150&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Left modules&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;400&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More main content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;150&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Right modules &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Some footer text. &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can see that this layout has some simple static text in it, such as &quot;left modules&quot; and &quot;Some footer text.&quot; Now I will replace this text with dynamic Mambo variables.

====Site name====

Mambo has a variable for the site name, and this variable is mainly used in the page title and when sending e-mails etc with Mambo. This variable can also be echoed in the template, and this is what will be done here. Of course, you can also write the name of the site directly into the template, but it is more appropriate to use this variable, as it makes the template more dynamic.

This is what the variable looks like: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$GLOBALS[mosConfig_sitename]&lt;/source&gt;

Now, when entering php code into a template, you'll need to use the php-tags for this, so that PHP will render the variable into what it is. Then it will look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php echo $GLOBALS[mosConfig_sitename] ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Place this line in the template, instead of the SITE NAME-text that is there now.

====Pathway====

The pathway uses a similar dsg:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php dsf?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

====Modules====

In the layout you can see something called left- and right modules. This is a core function of Mambo, and is used to place small &quot;boxes&quot;, or modules, that can be e.g. a main menu, user login, newsflashes, most viewed items and so on. The term left and right is simply different module positions, and they can be chosen in Mambo.

Anyway, here is the codes:

Replace the &quot;Left modules&quot;-text with this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'left' ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

The right modules are very similar:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'right' ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

====The main content====

I will not explain much here, other than the way to do this is the same as with the above things; 
insert this where you want the main content to appear:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosMainBody(); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

====The footer====</text>

== System Requirements ==


=== Server - Apache ===

Mambo Open Source is designed and developed to support Apache, but it may work on IIS and other server types and clients. Since Apache is the preferred server, this article will only mention Apache.

The operating system Apache is installed on can be anything that the Apache platform supports, but it is Linux, Mac OS X, Windows 2000/XP and BSD that has been tested properly. Unix based systems are recommended, for security and preformance reasons.

[http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache HTTP server]

=== PHP ===

PHP will need to be installed and configured with Apache. Version 4.1.2 or newer is required. The MySQL and zlib modules must also be installed into PHP. There are tons of guides telling you how to do this, hopefully someone will create one here too.

PHP also needs to have a writable session save path. This is configured in the php.ini-file with the line ''session.save_path = /path''. PHP need to have full access to the folder specified here. On a windows system, this path will be something like ''session.save_path = C:\Program Files\Something'', while a unix system has the ''session.save_path = /home/var/www''-system.

Here is a useful link for Windows users: [http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=24136 Thread at Mamboserver.com].

[http://www.php.net/ PHP official site]

=== MySQL ===

The final ingredient is the MySQL database server. Mambo has been tested on MySQL 4.0 and 4.1 and can also run on later 3.0 releases.</text>

This are the rules for all modules in the Mambo Open Source book. '''Follow them without exceptions'''!

== Naming of content items ==

Name content item like this: &lt;tt&gt;Mambo Open Source/Name of item&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Include the chapter list ==

Add {{tlx|MAMBOTOC_SMALL}} to the top of every chapter of the book. This outputs the small table of contents, called chapters, and is needed for proper navigation in the book. This will also place pages in the [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Mambo Open Source]] category.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==

'''Observational learning''' or '''social learning''' refers to learning that occurs as a function of observing, retaining and replicating behaviour observed in others. It is most associated with the work of psychologist [[Albert Bandura]], who implemented some of the seminal studies in the area and initiated '''social learning theory'''.

Although observational learning can take place at any stage in life, it is thought to be particularly important during [[childhood]], particularly as [[authority]] becomes important. 

Because of this, social learning theory has influenced debates on the effect of [[television]] violence and parental [[role model]]s. Bandura's [[Bobo doll experiment]] is widely cited in psychology as a demonstration of observational learning and demonstrated that children are more likely to engage in violent play with a life size rebounding doll after watching an adult do the same.

Observational learning allows for learning without any change in behaviour and has therefore been used as an argument against strict [[behaviourism]] which argued that behaviour change must occur for new behaviours to be acquired.

===Required conditions===
Bandura called the process of social learning ''modelling'' and gave four conditions required for a person to successfully model the behaviour of someone else:

* Attention to the model
:A person must first pay attention to a person engaging in a certain behaviour (the model).

* Retention of details
:Once attending to the observed behaviour, the observer must be able to effectively remember what the model has done.
He talked a lot about sponge cake

*Motor reproduction
:The observer must be able to replicate the behaviour being observed. For example, juggling cannot be effectively learned by observing a model juggler if the observer does not already have the ability to perform the component actions (throwing and catching a ball).

*Motivation and Opportunity
:The observer must be motivated to carry out the action they have observed and remembered, and must have the opportunity to do so. For example, a suitably skilled person must want to replicate the behaviour of a model juggler, and needs to have an appropriate number of items to juggle to hand.

===Effect on behaviour===
Social learning may effect behaviour in the follow ways:
* Teaches new behaviours
* Increases or decreases the frequency of which previously learnt behaviours are carried out
* Can encourage previously forbidden behaviours
* Can increase or decrease similar behaviours. For example, observing a model excelling in piano playing may encourage an observer to excel in playing the saxophone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==
Social Exchange Theory (sub of Reinforcement):
-assumes freedom of choice and situations that require decision making; cost/benefit analysis
-people are hedonistic - they try to maximize rewards and minimize costs
-views social relationships primarily as exchanges of goods and services among persons
-include equity theory here as: predicting the conditions under which people try to change or restructure their relationships; a state of equity exists in a relationship when participants feel that the rewards they receive are proportional to the costs they bear

'''Social exchange theory''' is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] perspective that explains social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between parties. Social exchange theory posits that all human relationships are formed by the use of a subjective [[cost-benefit analysis]] and the ''comparison of alternatives''. For example, when a person perceives the costs of relationship as outweighing the perceived benefits, then the theory predicts that the person will choose to leave the relationship.

The early permuatations of Social Exchange Theory stem from Gouldner's (1960) norm of reciprocity, which simply argues that people aught to return benefits given to them in a relationship.  Later modifications to this theory focus attention on relational development and maintenance rules (see Murstein et al.)  [added by J.P. Boren, 2005]

For social exchange theorists, when the costs and benefits are equal in a relationship, then that relationship is not '''equitable'''. The notion of equity is a core part of social exchange theory.

Social exchange theory is intimately tied to [[rational choice theory]], and features all of its main assumptions.

'''Rational choice theory''' is a way of looking at deliberations between a number of potential courses of action, in which &quot;[[rationality]]&quot; of one form or another is used either to decide which course of action would be the best to take, or to predict which course of action actually will be taken. Such a perspective finds itself in [[model]]s for both [[human behavior]] and [[behavior]] of non-human but nonetheless potentially rational entities, such as [[corporations]].

Obviously, what is taken as &quot;rational&quot; is of chief importance here.  This varies with context:
* The technical meaning in economics is about [[preference]]s: preferences are defined to be rational if they are complete and transitive.  That is, that the decision maker is able to compare all of the alternatives, and that these comparisons are consistent.  See the [[preference]]s page for further explanation.
* If uncertainty is involved, then the [[independence axiom]] is often assumed in addition to rational preferences.
* Rationality can also mean that the decision maker always chooses the most preferred option, as in the [[Utility Maximization Problem]].

Often, to simplify [[calculation]] and ease [[prediction]], some rather unrealistic [[assumption]]s are made about the [[world]]. These can include:

* An individual has precise [[information]] about exactly what will occur under any choice made. (Alternatively, an individual has a reliable [[probability distribution]] describing what will happen under any choice made.)
* An individual has time and ability to weigh every choice against every other choice.
* An individual is fully aware of all possible choices.

Assumptions such as these have sparked criticism from a number of camps. Some people have tried to create models of [[bounded rationality]], which try to be more [[Psychology|psychologically]] plausible without giving up completely on the idea that some kind of [[reason]] underlies decision-making processes.

=== Why rational choice theory? ===

One question that can be asked is why people try to base their models on concepts such as &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;[[preference]]s&quot;, and what is implied by them, [[free will]]. Some potential reasons:

* They see people as &quot;rational&quot; [[being]]s, and thus believe that a model in which they are represented as such should be reasonably accurate
* Assumptions of rationality have useful formal properties

Various researchers has found some limits to this theory, under the name of [[bounded rationality]], an element used for example in [[behavioral economics]].

This article explains basics about the administrator section in mambo, and how to use it.


==What is the administration in mambo?==

The administration part of Mambo (often called Backend) is a key element. What mambo does is managing your content, and it is in the administration you do this. Here you have all the settings, you administer the menu, add and manage content, upload files to the download manager and so on.

The administration section of mambo is often called &quot;the backend&quot; in the mambo community.

=== How to get there ===

You get to the administration panel by entering an address in the address field of the browser (the field where you enter url's). If your sites url is ''www.yoursite.com'', the url to the admin section is '''www.yoursite.com/administrator'''. If the address is ''www.yoursite.com/folder'', the access to admin can be gained through '''www.yoursite.com/folder/administrator'''.

If you just installed mambo, and chose to install it with sample data, you can find a link to the administrator panel in the menu.

=== Log in ===

When you enter the admin-section, you'll first get prompted for a username and password. If you haven't done anything with this after the installation, the username is admin and the password is the one you specified during installation.

Enter the appropriate values here, and it will take you to the administration part of mambo.

=== The admin panel ===

Now you see the admin panel, if everything worked prior to what mentioned above.

On the top of the page, below the logo, is the '''drop-down menu'''. Here are the links to preform all available tasks in mambo. Although, depending on access level which tasks shown may vary from user to user. But with the default admin account, you will have access to everything. See the  [[Mambo_Open_Source/Which_options_available_for_each_usertype|user access article]] for more info about access levels.

In the middle to the left are the '''quickicons'''. These icons can be used to preform the most frequently preformed tasks, as [[Mambo_Open_Source/User_management|user management]], content writing, [[Mambo_Open_Source/Menu_management|menu management]] and [[Mambo_Open_Source/Dealing with images|image uploading]].

There are a number of different user types in Mambo, and it can be useful to know that privileges and rights each user type has. Sometimes, you may want a user to be able to write content but not publish it - there are user types for this.

=== Guest ===

The guest user is anyone visiting your website that has not logged in yet. Your site visitors can view all content and utilize all feature of the website that are available to all users including guests.

All other user levels have the same privileges as the guest user along with additional capabilities.


== Frontend ==


=== Registered user ===

The registered users will have access to all menu items in the class &quot;public&quot; and &quot;registered&quot;. The user will also have access to edit its own user details such as password and real name

=== Author ===

Access to the &quot;new&quot; buttons that shows under the articles when browsing a content category. Can't publish new articles, and cannot edit existing ones.

=== Editor ===

Can edit already published articles, as well as create new ones. Cannot publish articles.

=== Publisher ===

A publisher can create items, save them and publish them - a publisher can in other words publish articles on the front page without any approval from admininstrators.

== Backend ==



=== Manager ===

Content can be created or edited from both the frontend of your Mambo website or from the Administration backend. In both cases it is required that you have logged in. For basic explanations of content items, see [[Mambo_Open_Source/Content_basics|content basics-article]]. You can also read the [[Mambo_Open_Source/Administration_basics|administration basics article]]

===From frontend===

Browse to the ''content'' category were you want the article - e.g. &quot;news &gt; latest news&quot;. Here you can see a list of all the content items in the category, or a pagination or something similar. Somewhere on '''this page''' a &quot;new&quot;-icon shows up. Press this, and you enter the &quot;new content item&quot;-section.

Write the content as usual . On the bottom of this page, below the text fields, you can see some tabs and some parameters. Enter the parameters here as usual.

Press the save-button at the top of the page.

===From backend===

At the main page of the backend (the home-link), use the &quot;All content items&quot;-button in the quickicons-section. Here you get a list of all the content items available. Press the &quot;new&quot; button in the toolbar.

This takes you to the standard inputbox-view. Write content, and choose content section and category in the drop-down menus to the right of the items &quot;title&quot; and &quot;alias&quot;-fields.

The parameters box appear on the right of the inputs, and this should be configured the way you want it to.</text>

== Reverting page move vandalism ==

The way to revert page-move vandalism is to ''move the page back to its original name'', not to copy &amp;paste the original page onto the new one.  '''Copy&amp;paste &quot;moves&quot; are bad.  Don't do them.'''  Unfortunately, you've stopped other people from fixing the vandalism properly, and now we have to wait for an administrator to delete the new page so that [[Wikibooks:Ass Pus in Progress]] can be moved back to its original location. Please don't do that again. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 09:26, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:It's not so bad.  The deletion is done, and the page moved. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:47, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity School of Music ==

Please see my comments on the [Wikiversity:School of Music] page. While the content you've created is good, it does not belong within the SOM namespace, it is a textbook you've written, not a Wikiversity section.

== Moving vs Removing ==

Hi, You just removed ''global configuration''. maybe better idea could be to move to better place? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 23:54, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Hi,

:I removed it as it wasnt a part of the installation. I am sorry if that might seemed harsh, i don't want to scare away contributors, so thanks for contacting me! I have added an article for the global configuration under the miscellaneous chapter, and a new configuration-category. *[[Mambo_Open_Source/Global configuration|A link to the article]].

:Please feel free to do more contributions - and i will try to take it to the discussion page before simply deleting stuff.. =)

:--[[User:August]] 00:01, 28 Jun 2005

:: Hi, I have nothing against discussions, but time is passing :-) The same was my first idea ''Category:mambo open source'', but it is too long for inserting... so then I reconsidered when did 2 levels of Categories, see :
:: - {{bad link|Category:Information Technology}}, {{bad link|Category:How-tos}} - only for first Article [[Mambo Open Source]]
:: - {{bad link|Category:MOS}} - for all other articles... 
::Let's move this discussion to Mambo page? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 14:13, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::All this sound very good to me! Are you planning to write some content in this book too? I would very much like that, you'd be the first one besides me to acualt write an article here - all edits in this book that i didn't do so far were corrections of typos (exept from some additions in the resources-page).

== book rating. ==

Ok, it's new and not widely used but there is a template to rate the books: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage|75%|Apr 3, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short|75%|Apr 3, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Important - in the dynamic wiki environment - is the date when the rating was issued.

=== Explanation ===

In the beginning the rating of pages was just done by a small icon (you know 0%.png, 25%.png) etc. pp. and most pages are still rated this way.

However it is suggested that any new rating is done with the templates above. This templates also show the date when the rating was done. 

See [[Help:Development_stages]] for more details on how to rate a book.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 05:26, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== What should we do? ===

I am aware of this new system, as I just implented it into the norwegian wikibooks. But i had no idea it was new! Anyway, should I just go ahead and use those templates? And rate it to 50%?

=== Yes ===

Shure, i.E. I changed all ratings for [[Programming:Ada]] - at least when I found them.

=== It's done ===

Fixed the rating of the mambo open source book in the it-bookshelf template. --August 14:26, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Gambling to a Million==
*There are other one-page wikibooks, like [[How to Tie a Tie]]; furthermore, is the [[Jokebook]] really educational? [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 5 July 2005 16:27 (UTC)

::Well, i think that books like ''how to tie a tie'' and ''gambling to a million'' really should go away and be deleted - they are small and un needed, and as you can see, both have now been removed. None of those could have been called a book, ad it was one page only. If you had created a book, and started on a book, that could expand and be contributed to, and not a single page, chances are that no one would have deleted it. But one page only books, that you actually claimed to be 100% complete, has nothing in the wikibooks to do.

::Actually, I urge you to create a book about gambling that is a book, and not one page. If you do that, i will support it. I agree that a book about gambling, and the jokebook are not for educational puspouses, but as long as they are used and contributed to i find them very useful to have at the wikibooks.

Some browsers, among those Internet Explorer, doesn't show transparency on transparent png-images. Instead, a grey colour is shown. This fixes the problem, but only for Internet Explorer (Win). NB! This problem doesn't affect Firefox, Opera and Netscape.

==Why png?==

Many people say that one can use gif images - both Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and all major browsers support transparency in gif images. The thing is that transparency is pretty bad and lossy in quality compared to png images. Regular transparency with hard edges are no problem, but shadow and transparent gradients are no good with gif. Png can do this without problems, tough, only that Internet Explorer (Win) doesn't support it (IE for Mac does).

==How to solve the problem==

===Adding code to the relevant page===
There is a simple modification that needs to be done with the template(s) the site is using.

This can be done from mambo, as long as the appropriate files are writable. Log in to the backend. Choose &quot;Site &gt; Template Manager &gt; Site templates&quot;. Choose the template that should be modified (naturally the standard template) and choose &quot;edit&quot; in the toolbar.

On the top of this document, add this line:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
require_once(&quot;includes/ie_png.php&quot;);
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then upload the &quot;ie_png.php&quot;-file in the &quot;includes&quot; folder of your mambo installation. Here are the file:

[[Media:http://www.mambonordic.com/downloads/ie_png.zip]]

===Fixing the images themselves===

Internet Explorer (Win) can actually render some png-files - those with 256 colors. These images can contain any color in the HEX color scheme, but not more than 256 colors all together within the image. This is more than enough for most cases. Save/render the png images with this attribute, and Internet Explorer will actually render transparency.

There are some problems with transparent gradients, as fading shadows etc.</text>

This article '''explains the concept of server side scripting''', which is a key element in mambo.

==What is server side scripting?==

There are two major forms of scripting in web applications. One of them is client side scripting. This is scripts and code that is downloaded to the clients computer and is executed there. A good example of this is JavaScript and Flash. Here scripts are used to create animations, drop-down menus and other functions on the clients computer.

Server side scripting, on the opposite, keeps all the scripts on the server, and they are executed there. In this case, mambo is the script. Basically, the client sends a request to the server. The server, with mambo installed receives this request, and use the scripts on the server to create the page that the user has requested. Then, a finished version of the results of this program is sent to the user, with no scripts in it (exept from the client side scripts that might follow with a mambo site).</text>

'''Procedural Textures'''

Texturing objects can be broken down into two categories: procedural and image texturing.  Procedural texturing makes use of mathematical formulas to generate textures.  This is nice because it can be used to make relatively nice looking textures without external images which are very temperamental where you put them. Procedural Textures are all stored in the .blend file. These textures are obviously generated within Blender itself.  Image texturing uses images created or captured outside of Blender, either from an image manipulation program such as the Paint.NET, GIMP or Photoshop, or captured on a camera. We have already learned about image texturing, so let's move on to procedural texturing.

'''Current Procedural Textures'''

Blender currently supports many procedural textures, including: Clouds, Marble, Stucci, Wood, Magic, Blend, Noise, Musgrave, Voronoi and DistortedNoise.

==A Simple Wood Texture==
Let's define a simple wood texture:
* Start a new Blender document containing the default cube. 
* Select the cube (and nothing else)
* Go to the Materials tab [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png]] in the Properties Window, and click the “New” button to create a new material. 
* Call it &quot;Wood Material&quot;

Let's add some color and texture.  You can see the results at any time by pressing F12 to re-render the scene.  

Start by painting cube a base color using the Wood Material's &quot;diffuse&quot; color:
* In the “Material” tab, 
* Scroll down to the “Diffuse” properties panel and choose a darker brown color e.g. #A52A2A.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV for where brown fits in the color wheel.  

Next, let's add a texture to give the material some highlights.
* Switch to the “Texture” properties [[File:Blender259_Texture_Button.png]], and again click “New” to add a texture to your material.  
* Call it &quot;Wood Texture&quot;.  Notice at the very top &quot;Cube &gt; Wood Material &gt; Wood Texture&quot;
* Under “Type”, click on the popup menu that currently says “Clouds”, and change the type to “Wood”. 

The texture sample will show parallel alternating black and white bars that don’t look very woody at all.  Never fear!  The black regions will be the material's base &quot;diffuse&quot; color.  The white regions are like &quot;highlights&quot; that will be painted over the base.

Let's make some improvements to the texture:
* In the “Textures” tab, 
* Scroll to the “Wood” properties panel that appears, change the waveform from “Sine” to “Saw”. 
* In the next row of buttons down, change the type from the default “Bands” to “Ring Noise”. 
* Increase the Noise Size to 1.0. 
Now the texture sample should show something resembling wavy tree-rings. If you hit F12 to render now, you will see these rings covering your cube, except a) the colour is wrong, and b) normal wood patterns aren’t so nearly circular. 

To make the pattern more elongated:
* In the “Textures” tab, 
* Scroll to the “Mapping” properties panel, 
* Change the Size X value to 2.0 and Y to 0.4. This squishes the pattern down along the X-axis, and stretches it out along the Y-axis, giving the elliptical tree-ring shapes you commonly see on wood planks and boards.

Hit F12 to render again, and the shape of the texture should be looking a lot more woody now.  

The final step is to color the highlights in the texture:
* In the “Textures” tab, 
* Scroll to the “Influence” properties panel further down, 
* Click on the color swatch, and choose a nice brown colour.  
For a nicer effect, I chose a very light brown e.g. #DEB887.  

The result should look very woody indeed!

[[Image:Blender259WoodTextureSample.png]]

* Remember that you need to Render to see the wood grain on your object.

== Image Texture Settings ==
[[File:Checkerboard tile.svg|thumb|100px|Simple checkerboard]]
To understand how the texture settings apply to image/movie textures, start with an example texture. A nice simple one is this checkerboard at right—don’t forget to download it in (or convert it to) PNG format, as Blender cannot use an SVG file as a texture.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268TextureTypeMenuImage.png|thumb|upright]]
Start a new Blender document. Note the default cube already has a a default grey material, called “Material”, and this already has a single texture, called “Tex”, of type “None”, which means it has no effect.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Before proceeding, go to the World [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] context and turn on Environment Lighting (you can leave its default energy at 1.0). This will ensure the cube is more evenly lit, for easier visibility of the texture effect.}}

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268TextureContextImagePanelNone.png|thumb]]
Change the texture type to “Image or Movie”. You will immediately see some new panels pop up in the texture context. Look for the Image panel, as at right. This initially contains a popup menu icon for selecting from any previously-loaded images (this will start out empty), a “New” button for using one of Blender’s predefined test textures, and an “Open” button for loading an image from a file.

Click the “Open” button, and select your previously-downloaded or converted PNG version of the example checkerboard texture.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268TextureContextImageSettings.png|thumb|upright]]
Now a whole lot more settings will become visible. From the top, the panels are:
* Preview — gives you a simple display of how the texture looks.
* Colors — lets you make simple adjustments to the image brightness, contrast etc.
* Image — lets you choose from any already-loaded images, and shows you the pathname of the file the image was loaded from. Note the two arrows in a circle to the right of the pathname display: clicking this will tell Blender to reload the image from the file, which is useful if you make changes to it in an external image editor.
* Image Sampling — controls how the image can be interpreted in a different way from straight pixel values.
* Image Mapping — lets you crop the input image, and apply fixed numbers of repetitions to it along each axis, even before it goes through the usual texture-tiling repetition process.
* Mapping, Influence — these are more general panels that apply to all types of textures. They will be discussed in more detail shortly.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Image packing: the icon to the left of the image pathname lets you pack a complete copy of the image into the .blend file, so it no longer keeps reading the original image file. This can be useful if you want your .blend file to be self-contained, particularly if you want to send it to others. On the other hand, if your workflow depends on coordinating with someone else doing the image editing, it may be more convenient to leave it linking to a separate image file.}}

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender.png|thumb|Projection: flat; axes: X→X, Y→Y, Z→Z]]
If you render {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} now, you should end up with an image like this. Notice in the Projection menu (Mapping panel) the initial selection is “Flat”: this means that the texture X and Y coordinates go straight to object X and Y coordinates. Thus, the texture only appears on the top (and also bottom) of the cube, not on its sides. See also the three little popup menus just below the Projection menu, each containing the items X, Y and Z. These let you rearrange the object coordinates that the texture coordinates map to. If you change the first two, you can get the texture to appear on other pairs of sides of the cube, other than the top and bottom. The third menu (corresponding to the Z axis of the texture) has no effect (yet), because a flat image texture is only two-dimensional.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender2.png|thumb|Texture size increased to 3.]]
Now try changing the three “Size” fields in the Mapping panel: give them all a value of 3. This will uniformly shrink the texture pattern to one-third of its original size. Or alternatively, it will require three times the number of texture repetitions to span the same distance as the original.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender3.png|thumb|Texture projection set to Sphere]]
Now let’s try the other Projection types. Here’s what “Sphere” looks like. Imagine the texture pattern as a flat sheet stretched and curved around, and its edges joined to form a sphere surrounding the actual object; then the sphere is shrinkwrapped down onto the object.

Note the top and bottom edges of the sheet shrink down to single points at the north and south poles; this is why the squares of the checkerboard pattern turn into triangles next to these points.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Z-axis now works: because these projection types other than “Flat” turn the texture into a 3-dimensional object, you can now use all 3 of the axis-rearrangement menus to reorient the texture in interesting, not to say confusing, ways. What happens when you assign the same texture axis to more than one object axis?}}

[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender4.png|thumb|Texture projection set to Tube]]
Here’s a Tube mapping. Here the texture pattern sheet is rolled round into a cylinder, with only one pair of edges joined together, the top and bottom left open.

[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender5.png|thumb|Texture projection set to Cube]]
And lastly, here is a Cube mapping. Here 6 copies of the texture pattern are arranged parallel to the faces of a cube, before being shrinkwrapped onto the actual object. Which in this case, happens to be a cube.

Cube mappings are very commonly used in game engines, because they are just about the simplest way to wrap a texture around an entire object.

== Making Your Own Texture ==

Procedural texturing is very powerful; however, sometimes it is difficult or impossible to generate the desired realism with them.  Image texturing is there for you when you need it.  To review, the basic idea is to take an outside image and wrap it around your model.   You can use any texture, or a seamless one if you want it to repeat to get a tiled effect. The following shows how you create a seamless texture, and then how to apply any texture (seamless or otherwise) to an object.

=== The difference between 'tiled' and 'seamless' ===
In many cases a simple material will just not cut it for an object, and you will want to apply a texture to it. However, depending on the object, you may want to apply either a seamless or tileable texture. A seamless texture is an image that will, when applied to an object, spread evenly across the surface of the object without any visible borders or 'seams' even if the object is many times larger than the resolution of the image (also called 'procedural textures' in Blender). These can be useful in many situations; such as when you want a texture for a carpet to seamlessly repeat itself without having a huge resolution.

A tileable texture on the other hand, is an image that will repeat itself across an object, but with noticeable seams. Any image can be used as a tileable texture, but often they will only be used in specific instances such as a vinyl floor with a tiled pattern on it.

See [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Using_Textures|Using Textures]] for more details on applying images as textures, and using them to affect many other surface attributes such as luminosity, reflectivity, translucency, displacement etc.

=== How to make a tileable texture with the GIMP ===
[[File:MakeSeamlessSample.jpeg|thumb]]

It is easy to create a tiling texture image with [http://www.gimp.org the GIMP]. Start with the photo you want to use. Crop out any part you don’t want. Here’s an example random photo of some plants in my garden:

Go to Gimp’s “Filters” menu, and find the “Map” submenu. In here you will find the entry “Make Seamless”. Select it. That’s it:

Just to prove it works, here’s a (scaled-down) use of the result as a tiled fill pattern:

=== Other Image Texture Editors ===
*[http://www.spiralgraphics.biz/ww_overview.htm Wood Workshop] A free utility (Requires Operating System: Windows 2000/XP) that generates surprisingly high quality tiling wood texture images. These textures can be exported as standard image files for use within Blender.
*[http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/ MapZone] A free utility for Windows (works perfectly in [http://winehq.org/ Wine]) that generates node based procedural texture maps.  Mapzone can export diffuse, normal and alpha texture maps as standard image files.  It can also import SVG regions created with Blender's UV mapping tools.

Making objects with image textures is not really hard for simple objects like balls, cubes, and tubes. I'll show you how to do this:
[[File:The-rusty-ball.png|300px|right]]
* Make a new Scene in Blender and delete the default cube {{B3D:N2P/Key|Xkey}}.

* Make an object you want to have the image on (I recommend a Mesh plane, sphere or tube).
(If you are making a Mesh Plane, change your view to above, by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Key|Num7}})

To make a rusty ball I suggest an icosphere with a size of 2 which will fit nicely in the camera view.

* Sequence to add the Ball is: {{B3D:N2P/Key|Spacebar}}, Add, Mesh, Icosphere.

* Go to the materials ({{B3D:N2P/Key|F5}}) and select &quot;O Material&quot; from the popupmenu by the &quot;Add new&quot; button. (the little arrows)

* Now go to the textures ({{B3D:N2P/Key|F6}})  and choose &quot;Texture Type&quot; A drop down (or up) menu appears and you will get many options, the one we need is &quot;Load image&quot;. Click it, then select &quot;Load&quot; and navigate to an image you want to use. (Note: JPGs, PNGs or TGAs are recommended for Blender. Bitmaps tend to get all screwy.)

('''Noob Note:''' ''Do [http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient&amp;rlz=1T4GGLR_enUS262US264&amp;q=rust%20texture&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi ''a search for '''Rust Textures''' ''] if you do not have one handy.'')

* After this, you'll have to specify how your image should be applied to your object. To do this, go to the materials again, where you'll have to find the &quot;Map input&quot; tab (near the textures tab). If you have selected it, you'll see four buttons: ''Flat, Cube, Tube and Sphere''. Select the option which meets your object best. You can see a simple preview of the different options in the &quot;Preview&quot; window and try the different modes.

* Render your object. If you can't see your picture well, you can try to rotate your object or select another option in the &quot;Map input&quot; tab.

You can also render videos onto objects using this method.  Just select a movie in the &quot;Load image&quot; dialog and enable the option &quot;Movie&quot; at the textures buttons.  &lt;i&gt;NOTE:&lt;/i&gt; Blender ONLY works with Full Resolution video, not video which has been compressed using a codec.  Most video  software will allow you to export video as &quot;'''full frames'''&quot; or &quot;'''no compression'''&quot;.  Experiment a bit!

==UPDATE==
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

Much has changed in recent versions.  This is an excellent tutorial by the original author, but I will try to bring it up to date.

[[File:RUSTY BALL.jpg|300 px|right|The Rusty Ball]]

* Make a new scene in Blender and delete the default cube.
* Add a sphere.  Apply a Subsurf modifier and Smooth as we have learned in previous tutorials.
* Find a file picture that you want to apply to your object.  Check Flickr for something like &quot;rust texture.&quot;  (If you are going to share it, be sure you check the license of the texture you download.)
* IMPORTANT:  You need a seamless texture.  If you are not sure, use a program such as GIMP.  Use FILTERS &gt; MAP &gt; MAKE SEAMLESS.  Usually this works well but if your texture turns into gorp, try another one.
* In the Properties Panel, which by default is the bottom right panel, select the Material icon [[File:Blender268TextureIconMaterial.png]].
* Select NEW or if you already have a material in use, select the + sign to add a new material.  Give it a good name like rustyball.
* Click on the Texture Icon [[File:Blender268TextureIconBrush.png]].
* Click NEW or if you already have a texture loaded, click on the + to add a new one.  Give it a good name like RUST.
* The default type is CLOUDS.  Pull down the menu and change it to IMAGE OR MOVIE.
* Go to the IMAGE section, choose OPEN.  New options will become available.
* Under Source: Click the folder icon and navigate to your image.
* Scroll down.  In the Image Mapping area are some options that you may need to try.  If your image is small it may have to be repeated in the X or Y directions.
* In the Mapping section (yes, one section is Image Mapping and the other is just Mapping) after Projection, choose the shape closest to your object.  If you are using a sphere like the example, then choose ... you guessed it ... SPHERE.
* The Preview often looks a bit odd and stripey, but render your project and it should look very nice.
* This method works for all sorts of things.  Try making a brick wall with a wooden gate using Flickr textures or go back to the Jeep tutorial and put a pattern on your jeep.

== '''&quot;Every Material Known To Man&quot; Project''' ==

Want to share your material settings with the world?  This is the place! This page is going to be turning from a page to a chapter, but to do that we need your support! If you have an idea for a material, even if you don't know how to make it, just put it in the list to help! Someone out there knows how to make it, and if they come across this page with it listed, they might be willing to share.
&lt;noinclude&gt;
=== Etiquette ===
*Explain the basics of every material (such as Color, Spec, and shading, but not neccessarily specifics such as Emit or Trans), even if it is with standard &quot;Add New&quot; properties.
*IF you provide a picture, &lt;u&gt;explain&lt;/u&gt; in the method &lt;u&gt;all details&lt;/u&gt; to get us to make ours look the exact same way, do not omit any detail (including anything done in out tabs, or in other categories like Rendering. Also, say if you use something like RayMir or if you have additional lighting or objects to enhance the look!.)
*Make sure you explain the &quot;Tab&quot; and the &quot;Category&quot; for a material alterations, because not everyone might know what you mean. Be as formal as possible, categorize and organize, and try using the blender-used words instead of your own lingo, if possible.

&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;
*Bad explanation:''Set the material's texture's normal to 0.4''
*Good explanation:''Under the &quot;Map To&quot; Tab, Select the &quot;Nor&quot; Slider and set it to 0.4''
*Best explanation:
**'''''Map To:'''''
**''Output-&lt;u&gt;Nor&lt;/u&gt;''
**'''''Nor'''Slider-&lt;u&gt;0.4&lt;/u&gt;''

~~Do NOT replace or delete other people's method on your own. If you believe you have a better way, simply label their explanation &quot;Method A&quot; and create another sub-headline with your method as &quot;Method B&quot; (and so on). If you believe a method is incorrect, insufficiently detailed or plagarism, appeal to the original author (if able) or on the Discussion page and get support for a removal. &lt;br&gt;
~~Do NOT say your material is better than anyone elses-- everyone has a right to their own opinion and preferences --you may say your method is more &quot;detailed&quot; or &quot;memory-efficient&quot; or &quot;adaptable&quot;, but &lt;u&gt;DO NOT SLANDER&lt;/u&gt; other people's methods.&lt;br&gt;

Hope you don't mind me adding stuff. I like Digital Photography. :) [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:02, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

We definitely need to reorganize this page. The size of the page is getting unfriendly.. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 03:18, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)




:::I think let's classify the '''Digital Camera''' sub-section, and the '''Memory/ Batteries''' sub-sections into one separate page called '''Camera Types and Accessories''' -- we can expand to include flashes, filters, etc.

:::'''Taking Pictures''' and everything under it can probably be one separate page by itself.. at the moment, Pre- and Post-processing doesn't seem to have enough content to justify a page by itself, what do you think?

:::So, something like this on the first page:

:::*Introduction to Digital Photography (Short introduction on page)
:::*Taking Digital Photos (Opens New Page)
:::*Pre- and Post- Processing (Currently keep on page)
:::*Digital Camera Types and Accessories (Opens New Page)


[[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:33, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

For now it would be real improvement over keeping everything on one page. I just typed such long list to have an idea what is missing in this book and how to expand it. I'm new to wiki's so can you make your proposals into this book? --[[User:Minda315|Minda315]] 06:17, 2005 Apr 22 (UTC)

: No probs. Just let me do it over the weekend.. I'm at work and I'm actually supposed to '''work''' ^^; [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 06:22, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
----
Ok, the above big stack of changes is somewhat done, but the '''Taking Digital Photos''' part needs to be reworked again (still too big, Wiki complains... :) Take a look through and let me know what you guys think.

Two issues -- the pages are supposed to have a link at the top to point back to the previous page, doesn't seem to be working right now so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

The other thing is the standardization of URI links. I'm currently using '''&lt;nowiki&gt; [[wikipedia:subject|subject]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to link, but I noticed some of us using '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subject subject]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to link.  

This does change the way Wiki renders the page. Do we want to standardize this? [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:48, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Yes we need standartisation. I just added link in '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subject subject]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' format due to lack of wiki knowledge :( Anyway links to wikipedia, in my opinion, are very useful. 

:'''Taking  digital Photos''' in current stage is written somehow chaotic and needs to be arranged in more systematic way. It is good to view all things in practical aproach, but adding some theory, short terms descriptions (with links to wikipedia for details) won't hurt. I try to work on litle peaces, as I i have free time. One big problem is that I'm not native english speaker, and and learned english not in the scool but on my own, so my english texts are low quality :( --[[User:Minda315|Minda315]] 13:55, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)

:'''On the subject of links''', I would prefer the '''&lt;nowiki&gt; [[wikipedia:subject|subject]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' link because it is an internal link and somehow seems more trustworthy to me.  I am more hesitant to click on an external link because I have done that in the past and they've taken me to hoax sites.  I would say that if we have the ability to use the specialized wikepedia links then we should standardize on that, and use only external links when linking to an external URL. --[[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]] 21:20, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: I kind of like '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[wikipedia:subject|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' :-). --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 04:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)


----

Also, can the various contributors please update the Authors section? Would like to know who we are working with. :P [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 03:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Heh, nevermind, I've added [[User:Minda315|Minda315]] and [[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]]. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:47, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I think the outline above is a good start, making it more of a real book format rather than a glorified FAQ.  But I think we will find that once we have the new structure some of the sections need to be rewritten to avoid overly duplicate information.  Not to worry though, that's a bridge we can cross later.

One other suggestion.  I would really like to see more sample photographs that illustrate some of the concepts.  I am willing to start with some myself (over the next few days).  I think this could do wonders to anchor the readers attention around bits of information that this book is trying to communicate.

Meanwhile, I am trying to get the hang out of editing my comments here. --[[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]] 18:37, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Hi, will give my inputs whenever I get some free time. ==

Hello, I like digital and film photography too and so i will try to provide inputs for this book whenever i can get some free time. seeya around :o)

== Transwiki ==

You may be interested in using material from [[Transwiki:Digital camera astrophotography]].

== Copying from Wikipedia? ==

Hey there everyone.  I just have taken an interest in this wikibook, and I was wondering if there are any rules to coping from wikipedia?  Check out the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography#Sensor_size_and_angle_of_view Sensor size and angle of view] section of the Digital photography article in Wikipedia.  It seems like we could almost copy/paste that section into a new &quot;Choosing a digital Camera&quot; section, and then edit it to give a more buyers guide type feel for the different types of digital cameras (DSLR vs point and shoot vs cell phone)  Looking further into that article, about half of it would fit into a &quot;Choosing...&quot; section.   Any ideas?

:Wikipedia is open source, so there would be no problem copying it. However, I would make one point&amp;mdash;if we want to copy the content at this moment and then let it evolve independently (which is probably appropriate here), then copy'n'paste. Updates here will contextualize the information in this source and remain independent of updates to the wikipedia page...in other words, there should be no attempt to keep them in sync. On the other hand, if we do desire to keep a solid reference to the wikipedia page, then I would recommend we link and/or reference the wikipedia entry here, perhaps providing a brief summary of the relevant content of that entry.

:I don't know if this is a standard practice on Wikibooks, but I see no reason why it shouldn't be. (If your question is primarily concerned about copyright, no need&amp;mdash;all content created for both this site and Wikipedia are completely open source and license-free.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Did you have a hard time reading, understanding, digesting, or remembering Stephen Covey's bestselling book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People? Then this study guide may help you. 

'''If you read the book already:''' The guide will refresh and reinforce what you read, whether you understood it the first time or not.

'''If you plan to read the book:''' The guide will prepare your mind so you can understand the book with less effort.

'''If you have not read the book, and do not plan to read it:''' The guide will help you become familiar with what the book says, and reap some or many of its benefits, in less time and with less effort. We might say, learn 80% with 20% of the effort.

Let's face it, the book has a lot of great content, even though it is wordy and reading it can give you a headache.

== Habit 1: Be proactive ==
'''Take action''' and '''take responsibility'''. This is the basis of all further habits and a cornerstone of success. You will influence your life more than anyone else. You have the opportunity to use your free will and hard work to change yourself and your circumstances. You are only a victim if you allow yourself to be; if you are reactive rather than proactive. The emphasis of this habit is to do whatever is in your power to improve your situation. You are the creator, the actor and the doer in your life; get started and &quot;just do it&quot;. Since, in a situation, the thing that you can influence and change the most is your response to it - choose your response to any situation and you will find yourself in control. No one can &quot;make&quot; you angry if you decide you don't want to get angry. Don't let life set you up to be in a bad situation. Have confidence in yourself and believe that you can succeed at anything in life.

In your internal dialogue, replace language such as &quot;I must do X&quot; with &quot;I choose to do X&quot;, &quot;I have to&quot; with &quot;I want to&quot;, &quot;If only...&quot; with &quot;Let's see about...&quot; etc.
- I choose to not be angry in my work environment
- I choose to spend only planned expenses in my personal
- I want to be more present and involved in my family's happiness

== Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind ==
'''Visualize where you want to go'''. Before you start something sit down and '''plan it out'''. A little planning will usually save you a lot of actual work later. Use your creative forces to create images and plans in your head first, then carry out your plan. The plan is called the first creation; the second creation is formed when you carry out the plan, and its success depends on a well thought out first creation.

{{cquote|It's extremely easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the business of life, the thick of thin things.}}_ 

-I want to be family physician
- I want to have a full registration with HPSCA
- I want to become a usefull consultant
- I want to be a good husband, to be a good father
- I want to be respected

== Habit 3: Put first things first ==
'''Set priorities'''. Decide which of your roles and goals are most important, then determine what steps will best achieve those goals. Basically it means doing life with your values in hand. It means defining your idea of success in life from the image you would like to leave in the roles that you assume like (spouse, grandparent, voter, activist, student, employee, manager). The idea is to have these clearly defined and on a piece of paper.

We need to schedule our priorities. We can use the time management matrix to determine where to spend our time. 

''' There are four quadrants where we spend our time: '''
# Important and Urgent
# Important but not Urgent
# Urgent but not Important
# Not Urgent or Important
To be effective we need to take care of everything in quadrant 1 and then spend as much of our remaining time as possible in quadrant 2. We need to live in quadrants 1 and 2.

Quadrant 1 activities are the things that are important and urgent: emergencies, deadline-driven projects, crises, some meetings, some phone calls. These are the things we cannot and should not ignore. They demand our immediate attention.

Quadrant 2 activities include: all work in each of the 7 habits, maintenance, recreation, self-care, learning, reading, and relationship building. These are the things we don't do because they're never urgent. They're important, but once we finish dealing with the Urgent and Important crises, we often don't want to work in quadrant 2. We get distracted by Urgent things that are not important—quadrant 3 activities—such as phone calls, text messages or interruptions from others. We might want to retreat to the gratifying but wasteful activities of quadrant 4 because we feel like we deserve a break.  We don't realize that we are setting ourselves up for more crises in quadrant 1 by ignoring the important activities of quadrant 2.

= Public victory, the path to interdependence =
== Habit 4: Think win-win ==
Many people grow up with a competitive mindset (&quot;I win, you lose&quot;), a beaten-down mindset (&quot;I give up, do what you want to me&quot;), or a mix of these and other mindsets. Each of these has its place. However, for your most valuable family and business interactions, the most mature and effective goal is usually to seek situations which benefit everyone involved.

When you negotiate you should seek to make deals that help everyone.&lt;!-- Redundant, but keeps the following sentence from sticking out awkwardly. (Elembis, 2005-06-17) --&gt; In cases where this is not possible, it is best to have the mindset from the outset that you will walk away from the deal (&quot;win-win or no-deal&quot;).&lt;!-- Does this mean a competitive mindset is the next-best choice? If so, it could be clearer. (Elembis, 2005-06-17) --&gt;

== Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood ==
To influence and help others, you must first actively listen to them and understand their situation and concerns. For example, imagine a doctor who gives a prescription over the telephone without knowing all the necessary information about the patient and their condition. This could be a serious or even fatal error if the patient takes the wrong medicine. In the same way, when giving someone advice we should be quite careful to understand their circumstances well. Even excellent advice can be useless and wasted if it does not apply to the situation of the person receiving it.

It is most effective to listen actively with empathy, consciously trying to understand and to see the world from the other person's perspective. It is also beneficial to listen without judging. Avoid &quot;hearing&quot; through a filter formed by your own worldview, and do not impose your preconceived ideas on what you hear, because doing so will inhibit your efforts to put yourself in the other person's shoes.&lt;!-- I haven't read the book, so I'm merely guessing on the &quot;judging limits empathy&quot; explanation. It make sense, but it'd be best to find and summarize Covey's actual rationale. Remove this comment if my guess is correct. (Elembis, 2005-06-21) --&gt;

Once you have clearly understood the point of view of another person, it is equally important to be understood by them. You need to build the courage to respond to what you've heard and present your own view that takes what the other person has said into account.

== Habit 6: Synergize ==
This habit deals with '''teamwork''' and opening yourself emotionally to work with other people. Optimistic, emotionally-charged individuals who are living out the previous habits can work together in amazing ways and see new paths none of them would have found alone. To synergize means to value differences or disagreements within a group.  Instead of looking at the difference negatively, one can view this as beneficial and seek to understand why the difference exists.  In coming to understand the difference or disagreement, and thinking with a win/win attitude, a &quot;third alternative&quot; may appear.  A &quot;third alternative&quot; is one which neither party could have come up with alone but instead is generated out of understanding differences and seeking to reach a win/win solution.  This synergy is a bit chaotic but is also fun and stimulating. When you use synergy you are also improving your spiritual, emotional and social side of your life.

= The Seventh Habit - Renewal =
== Habit 7: Sharpen the saw ==
Take time to '''rejuvenate yourself''' and help prepare yourself to work better in the future. This often means relaxing, enjoying nature, meditating and praying (Steven Covey is a devout Mormon, as he explains in the book's introduction), reading Scripture or great literature, listening to classical music, and spending time with high-quality relationships.

The purpose of this habit is to regularly exercise the four components which many believe make up the human being: body, mind, heart and spirit.

* '''Body''': Exercise for a sense of well-being.
* '''Mind''': Exercise to sharpen the intellectual abilities.
* '''Spirit''': Exercise with meditations and inner reflections.
* '''Heart''': Exercise care for important relationships.

The fourth category is not an exercise like the others, but rather a commitment to use habits 4, 5 and 6 in everyday life.

Keep positive enthusiasm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Old discussion from the talk page at Wikisource==

===Initial comments===
I think that this material is an interesting development which, if carried to completion, would bring credit to Wikisource.  My concern at this point is with copyright.  That the original Hebrew is in the public domain seems obvious, but it would be helpful if you would comment on the copyright status of the English portion of these articles.  [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 01:46, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:Though we may disagree on some other things, on this I think you are 100% correct.  The funny thing is that the problem is the opposite of what you might expect: It is not the English portion that may raise copyright issues, but the Hebrew portion.

:The English portion is not so problematic because the Mishnah is, to put it simply, not considered a very &quot;hard&quot; text.  Lots of laymen study it in the &quot;Daily Mishnah&quot; program.  For a person with just a modicum of experience in Mishnah study, to produce a reasonable translation of just one mishnah takes no more than 5-10 minutes.  So we need not worry so much about copyright here, unless new participants start quoting verbatum from published translations.  That has not happened yet, and we will have to put up a clear notice to make sure that it doesn't in the future.

:The Hebrew portion is a bit more problematic.  Obviously, the old Hebrew texts are not copyrighted.  But the digital editions of them are.  For the Hebrew, I have either typed from the old editions manually and edited according to my own standards, which poses no problems and is clearly not based on anything else.  In only one case (Maimonides' version of the Mishnah) did I use someone else's electronic edition, but only after getting written permission from the source (Mechon Mamre - see their website).  The vowelized Hebrew versions of the Mishnah may raise problems if they are not done manually.

:I hope this project can be an example of a multilingual community effort towards the joint study, translation, and editing of classical texts.  It need not be limited to Mishnah - the same thing could be done for the writings of Aristotle if enough people are interested!  (I am, though I don't know Greek!) [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 05:56, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Making an electronic version of old public domain material usually does not create a new copyright.  There must be something creative to make the material copyrightable.  I presume that the vowelization that were added follows established rules and traditions, so that too is not copyrightable.  I am, of course, not familiar with the Hebrew site that you used.  That a site adds a copyright notice to its material does not mean that everything there suddenly has a new copyright.  Their copyrights would still be limited to new material such as introductions that they added themselves, and the general layout of their page.

::For the English, if the translations are your own that is perfectly fine, but that should be mentioned on the headpage.  If the introduction and explanations, are taken from Maimonides the proper credit should be given, and information about when the underlying English text was '''first''' published should be given.  If all the explanations are from the same source, it should be enough to mention it on the headpage for your project.  Getting this right from the beginning could save us from future problems.  [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 06:50, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC) 

:::Maybe I am worrying too much about copyright?  See below for more on English translations.  There is a slight misunderstanding here about Maimonides: He was a great medieval scholar whose very own handwritten manuscript of the Mishnah with his commentary is still extant (in Oxford and Jerusalem).  He indicated that he edited the text carefully from even older manuscripts that he consulted. So this is an important text consulted in critical editions. [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 22:16, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===New Participant(s)===

To the new participant(s) in this project who have created the index to Berakhot and some wonderful work on several mishnayot:

'''Welcome''' and thank you so much for the material you added!

If you don't mind, please introduce yourselves by selecting a username (also so that you can be contacted on the site).

What you wrote so far is fantastic in my opinion, please keep it up.

A question on one detail: What is the source of the vowelized Hebrew mishnah?  (Remember that the commercial databases are coyrighted.)  In the Hebrew I only did two examples of this, which I produced half-manually through an old program called &quot;auto-nikkud&quot;.  This is very time-consuming, which is why I didn't do any more than those two examples.

Keep up the good work!

[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 06:16, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===Vowelized Mishnah===
PS - On the vowelized mishnah: Perhaps the best thing possible regarding this, since it is so tedious to do manually, would be if we actually could use an extant digital text by writing to the owner, explaining who we are, and asking for written permission.  It seems to me it can't hurt to try.  What do people think? [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 06:26, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:I agree that asking wouldn't hurt, but as I said before, I suspect that that part of the material may not be covered by copyright at all.  In the alternative, would there not be Hebrew OCR software that could handle this? [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 23:41, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===English Translations===
The following are the published English translations and/or commentaries for the entire Mishnah: Danby, Blackman, Artscroll, and the English Kehati.  (Whoops!  I almost forgot Neusner.)  Danby and Neusner are not meant for popular audiences, so I doubt anyone will use them.  Blackman is an old, but still good popular translation, which I own a personal copy of but rarely use it any more.  So I can check to make sure no texts are &quot;lifted&quot; from there.  Artscroll and Kehati are popular today, but I don't use them, and the other person doesn't follow their style at all in the examples he submitted.  So there is no problem here.  The translations are our own, and as more people work on them will eventually become collective creations of the community. The explanations so far are eclectic compilations from the traditional commentaries (though they could include modern scholarship as well). [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 22:16, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:From searching around I did determine that Blackman was first published in 1951, and thus still covered by copyright.  I presume that the others are all more recent.  I would say go ahead and add the text of Maimonides' commentary, but I don't know when it was first published in English.  Despite the large amount that he wrote only his ''Guide to the Perplexed'' seems to be easily available on the net.  If the contributors understand that they are publishing under GFDL we should be okay with copyright.  Some may argue that this whole venture belongs in Wikibooks, but I think you're fine where you are.  New commentary was forseen in the early days of Wikibooks, but that has never really gotten off the ground. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 00:59, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Maimonides' Arabic-language commentary on the Mishnah has never been translated into English (and I certainly don't envision doing that here myself, though someone else who is extraordinarily ambitious may certainly try).  I am not talking about the Arabic commentary anyway, but his Hebrew text of the Mishnah itself.  The ''Guide'' is readily available on the net for the simple reason that a century-old English translation (public domain) exists.  WikiBooks is for new open source course-texts (like &quot;Chemistry 001&quot; or at best an annotated Shakespeare), not primary texts. The latter are why we are here at WikiSource. [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 06:43, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I have no objection at all to the project being here.  The Chemistry 001 would certainly be out of place, but an annotated Shakespeare with two side-by-side edit boxes for text and annotations would be nice.  Translations too in side-by-side boxes could be interesting. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 07:41, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==

Hi! I noticed your book is in the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace. This namespace is reserved for pages dealing with Wikibooks in general or are about Wikibooks (like [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] or [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. I therefore suggest you to move your book to the main namespace, that is:
 [[The Open Mishnah Project]]
 [[The Open Mishnah Project/Advertisement]]
 [[The Open Mishnah Project/Permissions]]
 [[The Open Mishnah Project/Mishnah Tractate]]
and so on. Look at the ongoing discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. If you have any questions about this just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:26, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:I thought I was supposed to do that since this is the project page. But it really doesn't matter; in fact, it actually makes things much simpler to drop the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; prefix from the page names.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 20:57, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:: Hi, Sorry, I noticed later that this was a project page to another book. I don't really know where this page would best fit to. I had the impression that &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; was reserved for general pages, concerning more or less all Wikibooks (not just one specific one). Usually, the project page would be on the discussion page of the book (just &quot;Talk:Mishnah&quot;). But it seems, you have some Project page content also on the main page &quot;Mishnah&quot; (&quot;How to contribute&quot;, etc.), so the distinction is not very clear to me. What about putting it all into one book? Then the Project page would be a subpage of Mishnah, like &quot;Mishnah/Project&quot;, &quot;Mishnah/Project/How to contribute&quot;, &quot;Mishnah/Project/Advertisement&quot;, and so on. (at a later stage, you may want to think about gradually moving to subpage delimiters &quot;Mishnah/Berakhot/1:1&quot; instead of blank space &quot;Mishnah Berakhot 1:1&quot; also for the other pages of the Mishnah book, but that is not urgent..) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:02, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

OK, I guess there needs to be some sort of convention as to whether the project page for a book goes under &quot;Wikibooks&quot; or not. When there is a decision, it will be fine to move it (or not). Also: I agree with you that the current &quot;Mishnah&quot; page looks too much like the project page. I will try to fix that when I get a chance. The plan is, when there is more material, the &quot;Mishnah&quot; page will be a clear index to the contents of the entire book (to see what I mean, glance at the Hebrew version of the page, which catalogues over 100 individual pages).

As far as subpages: When I started this whole thing a while ago (on Hebrew Wikisource and later at Hebrew Wikibooks) I played around with a number of organizational possibilities, including subpages. In the end I came to the conclusion that the simple, official title of the single unit of text, without any other syntax, was easiest, as long as it was complemented by a useful system of links at the top of the page (a kind of navigation bar: next unit, previous unit, tractate index, Mishnah index) and categories at the bottom. (All of these pages and indexes, by the way, are also much simpler to link ''between languages'' than subpages.) It might be hard for you to navigate the many Hebrew pages that actually implement this, but if you are able to succeed despite the language barrier you will see that the hierarchy of texts is at once extremely clear and extremely easy to navigate in any direction, but in a way that would be much more difficult to do with subpages.

Because there are much fewer texts, demonstrating this is currently far less awesome in English than in Hebrew. But try clicking the links from [[Mishnah Berakhot 1:2]] to get some sort of any idea of how this might function. [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 13:54, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

PS Andreas - thank you for referring me to [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. Now I can learn from people's past experience and proposals, and see where what I've tried to do fits into past experience. Actually, it seems that what I've done here, and especially in the Hebrew parallel, is [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy_naming_scheme#No_delimiter.2C_no_book_title_on_subpages|&quot;No delimiter, no book title on subpages&quot;]]. However, neither of the disadvantages mentioned there apply at all in the system used here.

Actually, the discussion there of the advantages and disadvantages in the various systems doesn't take into account linking between parallel texts in different languages, which would be far more cumbersome with subpages. May I suggest that the outcome be more than one possible model?[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 14:32, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Dovi, if you think [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]] is missing advantages or disadvantages, feel free to add them there (it is still discussion in progress). I highly welcome your input, since this is a point I was not aware of. I looked at your Hebrew pages and felt like Alice through the looking-glass (in a mirror world) :-) I just wonder, why would it be more difficult to link to a page in another language using subpages than using &quot; &quot; space? I don't see any conceptual difference. In the Hebrew version, would you organize the URL address line in the browser from left to right, or right to left? That is, &quot;Book/Chapter/Section&quot; or &quot;Section/Chapter/Book&quot;? Is this the difficulty you are referring to?
::In Hebrew it is written backwards, but in the same order, so it doesn't cause a problem (how strange... :-)
: Other than that, you are free to add your navigation line at the top and bottom as you did, regardless whether you use subpages or namespace or whatever. So there should not be any difference. 
: The idea of unifying the delimiter on the long run is to prepare wikibooks for further enhancement changes in the future (like all-pages-in-one print version, or automatic page-to-page navigation) which would only work, if all books have the same organizational structure, for example, subpages..). But of course, if you don't want to change your book, don't change it, and I also won't do so. As long as there is no clear outcome of the discussion and the software has not changed yet, there is no point yet in doing it. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:20, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Hmmm again... What you are saying is that there is really no difference in terms of ease of use between &quot;Mishnah Berakhot 1:2&quot; versus Mishnah/Berakhot/1:2&quot; or &quot;Mishnah/Berakhot/1/2&quot;. At first glance I do think it is more pleasant to the eye (and a better recognized reference) without all the slashes, but on the other hand is it really so significant at all? I'm going to have to think about this... Also do realize that there is yet a fifth level in the Hebrew that hasn't been applied in English. Without slashes it can be ignored or added at will on a navigation bar.

Anyways, there is a lot to think about here. Thanks for all the thoughtful advice. Let's keep working on this, not only for this book but because a useful (and perhaps flexible) system is important for all of them.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 22:14, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the western world, ancient history is generally thought to encompass the period of time when writing and historical records first appear. This is roughly 7,500 years ago (5,500 BC). For some, the discovery of agriculture, roughly 6,000 BC is the beginning of ancient history. The most common date for an end of ancient history in Europe is 476 AD (the fall of the Western Roman Empire), however the exact date is still disputed among various historians. In Europe ancient history was followed by Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000-5,500 years, with cuneiform possibly being the oldest form of writing. Genetic evidence, however, points to the first appearance of human beings about 150,000 years ago. There is also a growing body of evidence that Homo sapiens first left Africa about 60,000 years ago.


The 1st millennium BC encompasses the Iron Age and sees the rise of successive empires. The Neo-Assyrian Empire, followed by the Achaemenids. In Greece, Classical Antiquity begins with the colonization of Magna Graecia and peaks with the rise of Hellenism. The close of the millennium sees the rise of the Roman Empire. In South Asia, the Vedic civilization blends into the Maurya Empire. The early Celts dominate Central Europe while Northern Europe is in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The Scythians dominate Central Asia. In China, Spring and Autumn Period sees the rise of Confucianism. Towards the close of the millennium, the Han Dynasty extends Chinese power towards Central Asia, where it borders on Indo-Greek and Iranian states. The Maya civilization rises in Central America, while in Africa, Ancient Egypt begins its decline and Ethiopian civilization its rise. The religions of Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism (Vedic religion and Vedanta), Jainism and Buddhism develop. Graeco-Roman Europe, India and China see the rise of literature. World population triples in the course of the millennium, reaching some 170 million people at its close.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Western philosophy is a line of related philosophical thinking, beginning in Ancient Greece, and including the predominant philosophical thinking of Europe and its former colonies up to the present day. The concept of philosophy itself originated in the West, derived from the ancient Greek word philosophia (φιλοσοφια); literally, &quot;the love of wisdom&quot; (philein = &quot;to love&quot; + sophia = wisdom, in the sense of theoretical or cosmic insight). However, many non-Western religions have adopted the term philosophy in reference to cosmic intellectual discourse analogous to Western philosophy. 

Western philosophy has had a tremendous influence on, and has been greatly influenced by, Western religion, science, and politics. Indeed, the central concepts of these fields can be thought of as elements or branches of Western philosophy. To the Ancient Greeks, these fields were often one and the same. Thus, in the West, philosophy is an expansive and ambiguous concept. Today, however, what generally distinguishes philosophy from other Western disciplines is the notion that philosophy is a &quot;deeper&quot; and more rational, fundamental, and universal form of thought than other disciplines.

''Reason'' was the key word for Ancient Greek philosophers.  Through the use of rationalism, Greeks laid the foundations for both western science and humanities.  For example, Democritus, an early Greek philosopher, through the use of reason, not technology, designed the concept of ''atomos,'' or the atom.  He believed his small particle to be the building block of nature, and today, through the use of microscopes and other technology, we have verified his claims.  

Agriculture led to several major changes. It allowed far larger population densities, which organized themselves into states. There are several definitions used for the term &quot;state.&quot; Max Weber and Norbert Elias defined the state as an organization of people that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force in a particular geographic area.

Borders delineate states - a prominent example is the Great Wall of China, which stretches over 6700 km, and was first erected in the 3rd century BC to protect the north from nomadic invaders. It has been rebuilt and augmented several times since.

The first states appeared in Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley in the late 4th and early 3rd millennia BC. In Mesopotamia, there were several city-states. Ancient Egypt began as a state without cities, but cities soon arose. A state needs an army to impose the legitimate use of force. An army needs a bureaucracy to maintain it. The only exception to this appears to be the Indus Valley civilization due to a lack of evidence of military force.

States appeared in China in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC. Major wars broke out between states in the Middle East. The treaty of Kadesh, one of the first peace treaties, was concluded between the Hittites and ancient Egypt ca.1275 BC. Major empires came into being with conquered areas ruled by central tribes, such as Persia (6th century BC), the Mauryan Empire (4th century BC), China (3rd century BC), and the Roman Empire (1st century BC).

Clashes among major empires took place in the 8th century AD, when the Islamic Caliphate of Arabia (ruling from Spain to Iran) and the Tang dynasty of China (ruling from Xinjiang to Korea) fought for decades for control of Central Asia. The largest contiguous land empire was the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century. By then, most humans in Europe, Asia and North Africa belonged to states. There were states as well in Mexico and western South America. States continued to control more and more of the world's territory and population; the last 'empty' territories were divided among states in the Treaty of Berlin (1878 AD).

===City and Trade===

Vasco da Gama sailed to India to bring back spices in the late 15th century AD and early 16th century AD.

Agriculture also created, and allowed for the storage of, food surpluses that could support people not directly involved in food production. The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first cities. These were centers of trade, manufacturing and political power with nearly no agricultural production of their own. The cities were parasites of a sort, absorbing agricultural products from the surrounding countryside, but providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military protection.

The development of cities led to what has been called civilization: first Sumerian civilization in lower Mesopotamia (3500 BC), followed by Egyptian civilization along the Nile (3300 BC) and Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley (3300 BC). There is evidence of elaborate cities with high levels of social and economic complexity. However, these civilizations were so different from each other that they almost certainly originated independently. It was at this time that writing and extensive trade were introduced.

In China, proto-urban societies may have developed from 2500 BC, but the first dynasty to be identified by archeology is that of the Shang Dynasty. The 2nd millennium BC saw the emergence of civilization in Crete, mainland Greece and central Turkey. In the Americas, civilizations such as the Maya, the Moche and Nazca emerged in Mesoamerica and Peru at the end of the 1st millennium BC. Coinage was introduced in Lydia.

Long-range trade routes first appeared in the 3rd millennium BC, when Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. Trade routes also appeared in the eastern Mediterranean in the 4th millennium BC. The Silk Road between China and Syria began in the 2nd millennium BC. Cities in Central Asia and Persia were major crossroads of these trade routes. Phoenician and Greek civilizations founded empires in the Mediterranean basin in the 1st century BC, based on trade. The large scale transportation of commodities before the modern age was unique to the ancient Greek civilization. Arabs dominated the trade routes in the Indian Ocean, East Asia, and the Sahara in the late 1st millennium AD and early second millennium AD. Arabs and Jews also dominated trade in the Mediterranean in the late 1st millennium. Italians took over this role in the early 2nd millennium AD. Flemish and German cities were at the center of trade routes in Northern Europe in the early 2nd millennium AD. In all areas, major cities developed at crossroads along the trade routes.

===Religion and Philosophy===

Main articles: History of philosophy and Development of religion
New philosophies and religions arose in both east and west, particularly around the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with Hinduism and Buddhism in India, Zoroastrianism in Persia being some of the earliest major faiths. The Abrahamic religions also trace their origin to this time[citation needed]. In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were Taoism, Legalism, and Confucianism. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of Plato and Aristotle, was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of Alexander of Macedon in the 4th century BC.

===Major Civilizations and Regions===

By the last centuries BC, the Mediterranean, the Ganges and the Yellow River became the seats of empires which future rulers would strive to imitate. In India, the Mauryan Empire ruled over much of the Indian subcontinent, while the Pandyas ruled the south of India. In China, the Qin and Han dynasties extended the rule of imperial government through political unity, improved communications and also notably the establishment of state monopolies by Emperor Wu.
In the west, the Ancient Greeks established a civilization that is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of modern western civilization. Some centuries later the Romans began expanding their territory through conquest and colonization from the 3rd century BC. By the reign of Emperor Augustus in the late 1st century, Rome controlled all the lands surrounding the Mediterranean.

The great empires rested on the ability to exploit the process of military annexation and the formation of defended human settlements to become agricultural centers. The relative peace they brought encouraged international trade, most notably were the massive trade routes in the Mediterranean sea that were developed by the time of Hellenistic age, with were unparalleled in volume of trade until modern times and the growth of the Silk Road. They also faced common problems, such as those associated with maintaining huge armies and the support of a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the peasantry, whilst land-owning magnates were increasingly able to evade centralized control and its costs. The pressure of barbarians on the frontiers hastened the process of internal dissolution. The Han empire fell into civil war in 220 AD, whilst its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided around the same time.

Throughout the temperate zones of Eurasia, America, and North Africa, large empires continued to rise and fall.

The gradual breakup of the Roman Empire, which spanned several centuries following the 2nd century AD, coincided with the spread of Christianity westward from the Middle East. The western part of the Roman Empire fell under the domination of various Germanic tribes in the 5th century, and these polities gradually developed into a number of warring states, all associated, in one way or another, with the Roman Catholic Church. The remaining part of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean was henceforth known as the Byzantine Empire. Centuries later, a limited unity was restored to western Europe through the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, comprising a number of states in what is now Germany and Italy.
In China, dynasties would similarly rise and fall. Nomads from the north began to invade in the 4th century AD, eventually conquering nearly all of northern China and setting up many small kingdoms. The Sui Dynasty reunified China in 581, and under the Tang Dynasty (618-907) China entered into a second golden age. However, the Tang Dynasty also splintered and, after about half a century of turmoil, the Northern Song Dynasty reunified China in 982. Yet, pressure from nomadic empires to the north became increasingly urgent. All of North China was lost to the Jurchen in 1141 and the Mongol Empire conquered all of China in 1279, as well as almost all of Eurasia's landmass, missing only western and central Europe and Japan.
Northern India was ruled by the Guptas in these times. In southern India, three prominent Dravidan kingdoms emerged: Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. The ensuing stability contributed to herald the golden age of Hindu culture in the 4th and 5th centuries AD.

Vast societies also began to be built up in Central America at this time, with the Maya and the Aztecs in Mesoamerica being the most notable. As the mother culture of the Olmecs gradually declined, the great Mayan city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout Yucatán and surrounding areas. The later empire of the Aztec was built on neighboring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples, such as the Toltec.

South America saw the rise of the Inca in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Inca Empire of Tawantinsuyu spanned the entire range of the Andes and held its capital at Cusco. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent road system and unrivaled masonry.

Islam, which began in Arabia in the 7th century, was also one of the most remarkable forces in World history, growing from only a few followers to become the basis of a series of large empires in India, the Middle East, and North Africa.

In North East Africa, Nubia and Ethiopia, which both had long been linked to the Mediterranean world, remained Christian enclaves as the rest of Africa north of the equator converted to Islam. With Islam, came new technologies that, for the first time, allowed substantial trade to cross the Sahara. Taxes on this trade led to prosperity in North Africa and the rise of a series of kingdoms in the Sahel.

This period was marked by slow but steady technological improvements, with developments of influential importance such as the stirrup and the mouldboard plough arriving every few centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.

The coastal periphery was the first to be home to civilization, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.

The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The earliest known such central expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans who spread their languages into the Middle East, India, and in the Tocharians to the borders of China. The northern part of the continent, covering much of Siberia was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the tundra. These areas were very sparsely populated.

The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and desserts. The Caucuses, Himalayas, Karakum Desert, Gobi Desert formed barriers that the steppe horse men could only cross with difficulty. While technologically and culturally the urban city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend themselves against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force. Thus the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scalars and vectors==
===Scalars===
Scalars are simple values. They describe something like height, length, mass, number of chairs with a real number. e.g. 10 chairs, 5Kg, 2m: 10, 5 and 2 are scalars.

===Vectors===
Vectors have a magnitude and a direction. e.g. the velocity of a ball has both a speed and a direction in which it is moving.

===Basis Vectors===
All cartesian coordinate systems have a number of basis vectors equal to their dimension; for most applications in Theoretical Mechanics the vector space is E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, whose basis vectors are '''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

You may also see 
&lt;math&gt;\hat{\imath}&lt;/math&gt; for '''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''', 
&lt;math&gt;\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt; for '''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''', 
and &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; for '''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

Every vector is then a linear combination of these basis vectors.  Often, vectors are written as tuples, so that the vector a'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + b'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + c'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' is equivalent to the tuple (a, b, c).

The unity vector of any vector can be found by dividing all of its components by the length:
V = 3e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + 4e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
length: |V| = sqrt (3² + 4²) = sqrt (9 + 16) = sqrt 25 = 5 &lt;BR&gt;
Unity vector e&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = (3/5)e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + (4/5)e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

3/5 equals to the cosinus of the angle of this vector with the X-axis, 4/5 is the cosinus of the angle of this vector with the Y-axis:&lt;BR&gt;
argcos(3/5) = about 53°&lt;BR&gt;
argcos(4/5) = about 37°&lt;BR&gt;
Notice that both angles add up to 90°. This means this vector lays in the XY-plane. If it adds up to a larger number, it lays inside a 3D volume, not a plane.

====Equality====
Two vectors are equal if and only if both their magnitude and their direction are the same.&lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;ne; 5'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;ne; 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' - 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;ne; 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 3'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
10'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 10'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' - 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' - 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;

====Vector multiplied with scalar====
Multiply the magnitude of the vector with the scalar.&lt;BR&gt;
'''4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + '''3'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; '''* 2''' = '''8'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + '''6'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
3e&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; * 5 = 15e&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;

====Angle between 2 vectors====
This is the smallest angle between both vectors.

====Adding Two Vectors====

Two vectors are added component by component, like this:

(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') + (b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') = 
(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 
(a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' +
(a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''

So, for example:

(2'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 3'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') + ('''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') = 
(3'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 2'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''')

====Subtracting Two Vectors====

Subtracting a vector '''A''' from a vector '''B''' is no different than adding '''A''' and -1 * '''B''' together.

====Dot product====
a*b*cos &amp;theta;&lt;BR&gt;
With: a, b magnitude of the vectors; &amp;theta; angle between the vectors.

A.B = a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;

with A,B 2 vectors; a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; X-component of vector A, ...

Properties of the dot product:
Is a scalar.
When equal to zero: The angle between the vectors is 90°. or one of the vectors is zero.
Maximum: angle between the vectors is 0°

====Cross product====
U = A x B &lt;BR&gt;
U = a * b * sin &amp;theta; &lt;BR&gt;
U = (A&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
+ (A&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
+ (A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

Properties of the cross product:
Is a vector orthogonal to both A and B

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plant cells are immobile, encased in a rigid cell wall. Unlike animal cells, migration and programmed cell death play little role in the patterning of plant cell fates, nor can they move when their environment changes. If the supply of food is low or if there is a predator, animals can move, fight or fly. But plants cannot. They have to adapt constantly to their environment and their development is highly plastic. Animal development is mainly embryonic: the body shape is defined during embryogenesis and the adult derive from the enlargement of the embryo. In contrast, in plants, most of the development occurs post embryonically and never ceases. In fact, because plants can't escape from their physical locations, they adapt and &quot;escape&quot; through development. When there is a lack of nutrients or energy, the plant develops its root system to explore the ground or its aerial system to get some light. Under attack from a pathogen or herbivore, the plant is able to synthesise  signalling molecules to change its development and defend itself. 

Despite their sessile lifestyle, plant development is highly plastic, due to the important role of information exchange between neighbouring plant cells. It appears that cell are more dependent on their positional information rather than lineage origine as in animals. Almost every plant cell containing nucleus has been shown to be able to re-enter the cell cycle and divide. This occurs for example after wounding, neighbouring cells are able to divide and differentiate to replace dead cells.

In normal plant development, post embryonic growth comes from meristems. Meristem is a type of embryonic tissue in plants consisting of unspecialised, youthful cells called meristematic cells and found in areas of the plant where growth is or will take place - the roots and shoots. Meristematic cells are small isodiametric cells, the nuclei occupy most of the cell. The cytoplasm contains undifferentiated plastids and posses a small vacuole.

Pool of cells are kept meristematic and divide, cells exiting the meristematic zone, start elongating and then differentiating.

We’ll look at some of these unusual features of plant development using examples from the model plant, [[/Arabidopsis thaliana/]].

===''[[/Arabidopsis thaliana/]]'', a model plant for plant sciences===

''Arabidopsis thaliana'' grows quickly, produces prolific seed, and is [[/Plant Transformation|easy to transform]]. Its genome is completely sequenced and a large variety of experimental tools and genetic resources are available. This made the plant  become one of the favourite tool of plant scientists.

===The Arabidopsis Book===

Description: Edited by Chris Somerville and Elliot Meyerowitz. Co-edited by Jeff Dangl and Mark Stitt. An Open Access electronic book, The Arabidopsis Book (TAB), is an attempt at a new mode of communication between researchers and a new model for scientific publishing. TAB in its initial stage is a compilation of over 100 invited chapters, each reviewing in detail an important and interesting aspect of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, with reference to what is known in other plants and in other kingdoms. Each set of authors has agreed that their chapter can be kept up-to-date either by the original authors or by others. TAB will therefore be a dynamic information resource that will evolve with the state of knowledge. We envision evolution of the format as well as the contents - initially by taking advantage of the Web-based possibilities of hyperlinks, which will be added to cross-reference gene names and references to other chapters, and which will eventually lead from each gene and sequence reference to sequence databases, and from each paper cited to its abstract. The Arabidopsis Book is therefore envisioned as a complementary resource to the many databases that contain specific information about Arabidopsis, including The Arabidopsis Information Resource. It is our hope that this book will be broadly useful and, more generally, that it will facilitate the development of new web-based tools for dissemination of knowledge. TAB will be available only via the Internet and will be available free of charge. The American Society of Plant Biologists will provide funds for the mounting and maintenance of the book on the Internet as a public service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Portfolio Management is one of the most important aspects of investing, particularly for the investor with a maturing portfolio.  Think of the portfolio needing attention on three levels.  1) Pay attention to individual stocks held in the portfolio.  2) Pay attention to the asset allocation in order to maintain diversity and balance within the portfolio.  3) Pay attention to what is happening to the broad market and to the sectors within the broad market.

== Monitor Individual Stocks ==

Let's take the first assignment, that of paying attention to the individual stocks held in a portfolio.  One very useful tool that aids in this monitoring process is Toolkit 5.  Built into this software is a portfolio management section.  To put this portfolio management section of Toolkit to use one must first complete a Stock Selection Guide (SSG) analysis on each stock held in the portfolio.  Once one is familiar with the product it does not take long to complete this assignment.

Toolkit 5 has the option to build a library of stocks.  Set up a library to include all stocks held in the portfolio with the correct number of shares.  Once this is accomplished Toolkit 5 provides an Overview of the portfolio.  This shows the user the portfolio Total Return, U/D ratio, Relative Value etc.  Once one sees the Overview it is time to check the Alerts. If the Alert screen comes up blank, you are doing something good in the selection of stocks.  Pay particular attention to those stocks yielding a Defensive alert.  Go in and look at the PERT sheet to see what is going on with the stock.  Find out if Sales and or Earnings are in decline.  Determine what is causing the Defensive alert signal as it may be time to purge the stock from the portfolio.

== Monitor Asset Allocation==

== Active Asset Allocation ==
'''1.0  Portfolio Tilt'''

Harold R. Evensky in his book, &quot;'''''Wealth Management: The Financial Advisor's Guide to Investing and Managing Client Assets'''''&quot; does a fine job in defining Portfolio Tilt.  He writes, &quot;This is a strategy designed to add value by overweighting an investment class or style in order to take advantage of a perceived market anomaly.  An example would be the overweighting of small-cap stocks in January to take advantage of the January effect.  A more general example would be the permanent overweighting of the portfolio with low price/book stock.&quot;  This latter strategy is one where the investor would skew an asset allocation to the value side of the investment equation.  This is a strategy preferred by many asset allocators as historically, value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks.

Evensky continues to write, &quot;One quasi strategy that straddles market timing and portfolio tilt is sector rotation, i.e., the technique of tilting the portfolio in favor of market sectors that are expected to benefit most from the next economic wave.&quot;  More on this later when we look at Exponental Moving Averages (EMA) and Point &amp; Figure (PnF) charts.

'''2.0  Dynamic Asset Allocation'''

Dynamic Asset Allocation (DAA) is a mechanical method of rebalancing a portfolio due to market movements.  When an asset class moves out of its target ranges, the investor responds by bring &quot;out-of-line&quot; asset classes back into balance.  The sample asset allocation spreadsheet is a great aid in helping the investor accomplish these portfolio rebalancing activities.  There are some studies done by William Bernstein that show one should not rebalance a portfolio more than once every year.  While the asset allocation spreadsheet permits one to track what is going on daily, I highly recommend no rebalancing occur more than once a quarter. 

'''3.0  Tactical Asset Allocation'''

Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) is similar to DAA in that it requires periodic rebalancing of the portfolio.  Instead of a mechanical rebalancing activity due to the asset classes moving out of their target ranges, TAA requires the investor to know something about what is happening to sectors and asset classes of the market.  When is it time to shift assets to the value or growth sides of the portfolio equation?  When is it time to be in small-cap vs. large-cap stocks?  Is there a time to invest more heavily in REITs or international investments?  TAA relies on the assumption that different asset classes will revert to the mean.  If an asset class is a hot performer one year it is highly unlikely it will return the same performance a second or third year.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Kheer''' or '''payasam''' is a thick rice pudding.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:L|L]] (4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*250 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 cup) long grain white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
*125 mL (½ cup) white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*65 mL (¼ cup) [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultanas]] (raisins)
*6 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods
*65 mL (¼ cup) slivered blanched [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
*15 mL (1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]]) [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

==Procedure==
# Bring the milk to a boil.
# Add rice and cook slowly until thick (about 20 minutes).
# Stir in the sugar, sultanas (raisins), and the ground seeds from the cardamom pods (cook a further 5 minutes).
# Stir in the almonds and rosewater, and cover until ready to serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Stir the milk while bringing it to the boil.
*You may also want to leave the kheer boiling for much longer (several hours), until it has been significantly reduced; this provides a stronger flavour and a light-pink colour.
*You can use rice flour or vermicelli instead of plain rice.
*For kheer that is not too thick when cold, use 170 mL (⅔ cup) of rice instead.
*If to be eaten cold, it's nicer to use double the quantities of sugar, sultanas, and almonds.

==Warnings==
*The main difficulty in this dish is preventing the kheer from sticking to the bottom of the pan, that requires care.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cookbook vs. Wikipedia==
For anything kitchen-related, it is best to avoid linking to Wikipedia. In general, Wikipedia is not focused on cooking and does not provide links back into the cookbook. (there are rare exceptions) We need a [[Cookbook:Blender]] article. If you change blender links to go toward Wikipedia, then it is less likely that someone will write the [[Cookbook:Blender]] article. Since links to Wikipedia do not go to missing pages in en.wikibooks.org, the [[Special:Wantedpages]] page won't find them.

==Links Fixed==
I've changed all of my links to Wikipedia to link to Cookbook instead.
[[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 22:32, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== see if you can tell the difference ==

* [[w:Double_boiler]]
* [[w:Bain-marie]]

To me, it's looking like the main distinction is that a bain-marie goes in the '''oven'''. This suggests that the cookbook's &quot;bain-marie&quot; picture is actually a double-boiler, and that we don't have a bain-marie picture. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:13, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, that's what I thought. The picture of the bain-marie really does look like a double boiler. As the two are so similar, they could easily coexist on the same page. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 13:02, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== really obscure names ==

According to Google, &quot;cookie sheet&quot; is 38.7 times as popular as &quot;baking tray&quot;. Now, come on. It is quite unreasonable to use a name that most people around the world are unfamiliar with. I just asked my wife what a baking tray was, and it took her half a minute to guess.

I'm sometimes OK with the non-USA terms if the US audience would surely know the term, the US term is ambiguous, and the US term is obscure. I'm OK with &quot;Waffle Maker&quot; (ugh), if you insist.

I know it must suck to kind-of sort-of share a language, but be trained in a minority dialect. Try not to blame me for all the pain and suffering this must cause.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:22, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Leaving duplicate names in a list is very annoying to someone who wants to read about each item in turn. They'll go to pages more than once. Putting the alternate name in parentheses is reasonable. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

As far as naming standards go, I have been giving the matter some thought. I find that consistent use of titlecase (&quot;Fish and Chips&quot;) is extremely helpful when linking ingredients and recipes. I know the name I need for creating the link. So that's an argument for consistency. Then, what of the ''best'' choice? Well, link target names serve only one use outside of editing. They form the page '''title'''. This is a strong indication that titlecase is correct. I can also see an argument for pure lowercase, based on readability and allowing the occasional uppercase letter to indicate a proper noun. Switching the whole cookbook to pure lowercase would be a tremendous task, so I think this is not a good option unless there is some huge benefit which I am currently unaware of. Thus I have come to prefer titlecase. It's all over already; the equipment section is one of two main violators, the other being stuff like &quot;East Asian cuisines&quot; (where &quot;cuisine&quot; or cuisines&quot; is always lowercase in spite of everything else being uppercase). Switching to titlecase happens to be the least effort if consistency is desired, which is I'm fairly sure true. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

'''Baking sheet''' greatly bothers the ears, but at least it is understandable. '''Oven tray''' means nothing to me.

The problems for you are different from the problems for a US citizen. Because of the way the USA exports culture through movies and TV, you are likely to find US terminology understandable. It may annoy you greatly, but you can at least understand it. New Zealand might have wonderful culture, but it isn't being exported to the USA. A wee bit of British makes it over to the US, but not much. This means that cookbook readers in the USA will be left completely clueless by New Zealand terms.

Google constitutes a majority unless you can demonstrate that the search terms are picking up unrelated junk. In the case of &quot;oven tray&quot;, I'm pretty sure ''you'' are getting this advantage. Over here, &quot;oven tray&quot; might refer to the storage drawer commonly found under an oven. It might refer to something used with industrial ovens, including ones used for drying timber (dead trees) or curing paint.

I suppose that I do dislike linking to your page titles, but that isn't one of the significant issues. I tend to create a new duplicate page when the expected page is missing. This has been done many times. I dislike seeing your page titles at the top of the page, which is a very different problem that is unfixable by adding redirects. Also, adding all these redirects gets tiresome.

There are some [[Cookbook:Grunt_Work|definite written guidelines]] actually.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:23, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Do notice the date on those definite written guidelines; they are (just barely) old enough to prove that I didn't create them just to argue with you. :-) Also, they have been edited by someone who is British.

2/3 of the world's English speakers use American English. India may use English for government and upper-class business, but the rest of the country speaks hundreds of other languages.

&quot;cookie tray&quot; is not used much. I doubt such an item would be for cooking at all; it sounds like something for serving cookies at a party. If you really don't like &quot;cookie sheet&quot;, then please use &quot;baking sheet&quot;. Both &quot;oven&quot; and &quot;tray&quot; are uncommon in the names of such objects. It's a sheet, either &quot;cookie sheet&quot; or &quot;baking sheet&quot;.

It might help you to know that I got a rather bad impression of the community too when I showed up several months ago. Admins seemed to regularly delete pages without discussion. When a page did go to a vote for deletion, an admin would often be the prosecutor (placed the item up for deletion), judge (counting the votes, throwing away many as being suspect), and executioner (performing the deletion, without waiting for objections). An admin accused me of being a &quot;sock puppet&quot; (ask if you aren't familiar with the term) and also accused me of using sock puppets.

Perhaps a &quot;truly international&quot; wiki is more trouble than it is worth. Very very few American cooks can deal with a British recipe. The big problem is that kitchen scales and balances do not exist in US households. Then there are the unavailable ingredients, etc. This wiki is a cold and hostile place for Americans, but you probably can't see that.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:40, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Sugar formatting ==

What was the problem with '''&amp;lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&amp;gt;''' ? With browsers that don't support it (should be rare), it shouldn't do anything. This bit of code is used all over the place to ensure that pictures don't wind up in the wrong section. I know of no other way to properly (independant of font size and window size) prevent pictures from ending up adjacent to the wrong text.

Also note that the order is very wrong now. The brown sugar picture was next to the brown sugar. Now, brown sugar is white and white sugar is brown. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:57, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

So, it worked fine. I use Firefox too, and I see the vertical gaps too. The '''&amp;lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&amp;gt;''' code ensured that everything above and everything below will be separate, thus keeping an image from one section from slopping over into another section. It's like having an invisible line across the page. This is required to align the brown sugar image with the brown sugars, and the white sugar image with the white sugars. I did put those two images there specifically to be adjacent to the text, not to give a general impression. Shrinking the images should be enough to eliminate the gaps, but I'll put the white sugar up top. Having white after brown in the text did kind of bother me anyway, but the image perspective didn't bother me at all. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:02, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== firm vs. hard ==

Quinces and unripe tomatoes are more than just &quot;firm&quot;. I think you could drive nails with a quince! Typical low-cost commercial tomatoes are firm when they get to the store, but they are quite hard when picked. They're like apples. Some kinds of tofu are considered to be firm. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 08:10, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that firm is not a great word to describe green tomatoes, but neither is hard. I would call the shell of a nut hard, but not a green tomato. Quinces are more like a firm pear when totally ripe (though a slightly sour one). I took a bite out of the one pictured, and I could probable get used to it (it wasn't all that sour). Anyway, I don't totally disagree with the use of hard, but firm works too. What we really need is another word that means something in between, I simply used firm as it was the first thing that popped into my head when I was editing the page. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:52, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::So now the quince has a toothy grin and you need dentures? Get about 5 next time, and try the [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|quince crisp]] recipe. It ought to be pretty good; most apple varieties turn to mush but the quinces should hold up even better than Granny Smith apples. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:47, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:::My grandparents gave me four off their tree, that's why they were ripe. They are slowly being reintroduced to supermarkets, but those ones are pretty green and hard (as most supermarket fruit is). Yeah, quinces don't disintegrate like apples when cooked. I stewed mine.

== titlecase ==

When I showed up, it already looked like titlecase was the standard. There were of course deviations, but many recipes were already in titlecase. I figured that the others were mistakes carried over from Wikipedia. Apparently lots of people prefer titlecase, Wikipedia be damned.

If we actually ''think'' about this though, we should be using default (natural: &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;April&quot;) case in Wikipedia. By forcing the first letter to uppercase, we can't tell the Polish (people) from polish (stuff for shining shoes). It would be good for users to see that August is capatalized for a reason, and pH is not capitalized.

Wikipedia is very different from Wikibooks. Link renaming is nearly universal on Wikibooks. Wikipedia relys on a software hack to make the wiki appear to be case-insensitive to the casual observer, but this hack doesn't work for Wikibooks. (the software uppercases the first letter automatically)

So a technical hack (kludge, really) on Wikipedia leads to Wikipedia policy, but that hack doesn't apply on Wikibooks.

I just noticed your revert war with 217.33.207.195 on the main page. Y'know, if you could support my admin request in spite of our differences you wouldn't have to repeatedly revert stuff so often. It's not as if I'd be abusing admin powers to get my way in our numerous disputes; I think I've shown elsewhere that I can be trusted with such things. BTW, 217.33.207.195 is probably also &quot;Mann Ltd&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:19, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah, it was pretty pointless. After a while, I decided the best thing to do was to walk away. I doubt that 217.33.207.195 is going to reform any time soon. I thought that you were asleep at the time. Some vandals seem to wait until a time of day when the bulk of the admins are inactive.

Hey Donovan: Could I persuade you to reconsider your vote for Albert? I think both of you would be great admins, so it's kind of troubling to see the two of you blocking each other like this. (If not an outright support, how about an abstain?) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:I understand where you are coming from. But, strategically, it would have been better for Albert to appeal to my better nature, and to support my adminship, I would most likely have supported him then. As it is, his negative vote appears to have held thing up needlessly. Even without his support, I was seriously considering supporting his next bid for adminship (the current one was never going to succeed). But, since then, he has been virtually inactive. Before support his next bid for adminship, I would really like to see at least a month of moderately active and helpful editing over the whole of Wikibooks (mainly in fighting vandalism). BTW, I was under the understanding that to gain adminship, I only needed four votes of support, with no more than one in opposition, where abstains counted as neutral votes. I'm currently at seven to one, eight if you count my nominator.

== my Adminship ==

Thankyou for votting support for me, i'd like to note that the reason for my minimal edits is because of many of my edits are to revert spam, because wikipedia is rather large ans extensive and i really can't find anything i can contribute to, other than fighting vandalism, and then on wikinews, i am not the best writer although i want to contribute more article, mainly ones with original reporting if possible, and wikibooks, well even though my spelling isn't the best i love the idea behind Wikibooks and think i could contribute more to actual books and wikiversiry but also in fighting vandalism wich admins powers really help make it less stressful i've noticed, since its much easier with the rollback button and i'd have the ability to block vandals myself without having to find an admin, especially on wikinews this was a problem, cause some vandals would come out when no admins were online, i was though, and that really was a pain since i couldn't block them and no admins were around to do it.  Again thankyou for your support.--[[User:Ryan524|Ryan524]] 15:58, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Of Mice and Men rv ==
Geocachernemesis, just to let you know, not all of 195.144.131.4's edit on [[Of Mice and Men]] were misedits; some actually did make sense (if I remembered the book correctly). The contributor just got bored halfway I think. I was scratching my head on what to do with that mass/ mess.

No biggie, I'll go back to fix it later. Thanks for the rv. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 09:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't feel so bad about it, because many of 195.144.131.4's previous edits have been pretty inane (basically vandalism). I wasn't about to spend an hour sifting through extracting out the good information. It's been a while since I read the book, so it would be difficult to decide what to keep and what to leave out. If 195.144.131.4 wants to do it, then that's fine with me. I left an introductory note on their talk page pointing them to the sandbox, so we'll see what effect that has.

:Having me revert the whole lot does make it easier to pick out what was actually added, because you can just look at my diff. But, at the time 195.144.131.4 was stuffing around adding and removing vandalism with each edit, making it difficult to see what was really going on. Maybe I'll use that strategy again in future.

:: Aye, it worked out well. Alternatively, I can just look at the last good edit (in this case I cleaned up this article the last time, so I simply looked for my own edit there). Either way, just diff'ing the last good edit and 195.144.131.4's last edit save me from wandering through the whole load -- I can ignore the strange stuff (s)he had in between.

== GTA:SA Removal of redundant pages ==

We've been restructuring the San Andreas guide recently. We're keeping a track of all the pages in a [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas/Meta/Information|metadata]] page.

Can you delete all the pages under the section entitled [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas/Meta/Information#Orphaned Redirects|Orphaned Redirects]]? Obviously I mean the redirects themselves, not the pages they redirect to. :-)

If you could also update that section to indicate when this has been done, that would be nice too.

Thanks...

:I'm not an admin yet, and I'm pretty busy at the moment. But, you can easily mark those pages for deletion yourself. I've done the first one to show you how. First add the delete tag to the page with an explanation, see [[Template:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Header]]. Next, you must add a note to the end of the Speedy deletion candidates section of the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page, otherwise it won't be deleted. That's it, an administrator should come and deleted them within a week (not very speedy, I know).

== You're welcome! ==

I just happened to be the person who noticed the live vandalism had moved over to wikibooks, so I got delegated to clean it up. Since the twits doing it took the opportunity to say hello to me in IRC, I figured I'd better watch for a while and while I was RC patroling I took the time to clean out the speedy deletions. (I was going to also do the VfD, but I got a little lost in the policy and couldn't find if it was simple majority or some form of super-majority.)

By the way, there is an excellent tool which monitors changes on the Wikibooks in real-time, irc://irc.wikimedia.org/en.wikibooks This is an IRC chat room with a bot who is connected to the database and announces all the database changes. There are a couple of software written to use this stream of changes to help people monitoring the recent changes to wikimedia sites as well.

You may want to take a look at the many new pages being created by 80.56.38.110, who seems to be creating a medical dictionary or something?

==Medicine pages==
Hi, I'm the one who edited the Medicine section. I'm going to write more there. I added the links to create at least something. Before seriously writing, I'm placing some external links to begin with.
I'm in no way related to the Merck company. The Merck Manual is the world's most used medical reference book and is highly respect, written by several hundred mostly American top physicians. While the pages are lacking any actual content, this is a temporary beginning from which, hopefully, books will come forth. Also check the [[Medicine]] page, which I redirected to Medicine_Bookshelf, and see the discussion page there. If you're interested in participating, we could talk further there. In the meantime, please note that I just started working on this section of Wikibooks yesterday morning, and I'm not quite finished yet. In fact, the whole section on Medicine currently consists of only one single book ([[Radiation Oncology]]), and the book on [[Emergency Medicine]] is under construction. I edited the front page of Medicine yesterday, and made a beginning on the Neurology, Cardiology and Pediatrics sections. Anyway, let's keep the topic-related discussions to the Medicine discussion page, if you're interested?

:Oh good, carry on then.;) I just had to check with you to ensure that you were aware of how it looked. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. It should be an interesting book when it fills out a bit more.

: No worries. It's not just vandalism, but general stupidity. Obviously the newbies can't help it, and when they create new subpages for existing books, they're not always following naming conventions, and creating their new pages in the global namespace without indicating that they're part of an existing title. Other users are then just adding them to VfD, when it would be far better to convert them to the correct naming convention, and make sure the user in question is aware. To be fair, the site policies are much too difficult to locate for new users (it took me a few weeks to find them all), and incomplete in places, so I'm gonna have a go at improving that. Anyways. Glad you're back. The Wikibooks community needs more users who are prepared to '''be bold'''. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 15:59, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] ==

Can you please refrain from adding speedy deletions to this page. I've changed the rules to try to keep the page short and managable. Providing you've added the 'delete' template, the admins can see the speedies in the page [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]]. An admin will move it to the VfD page if they believe it requires a vote. Please re-read the VfD page up to the TOC, and the page [[Wikibooks talk:Votes for deletion]] for details. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:28, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

:It is quite a major change to the way things had been done, and not particularly well advertised. But, if that's how it's done now, then so be it. My only concern is that it makes it far easier for pages to be listed for speedy deletion, and that could be abused easily. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 23:29, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

I did put in quite a bit of thought before making this change. The deletion policy states that speedies are optional to add in. I guess I should change that to say they should never be added. If you're not certain, use a VfD instead. Just seems like reducing the amount of house-keeping required to keep this site running means more problems can be addressed more quickly. All you have to do now is add the template include, and move on to the next one. And to be fair, speedies could always be easily abused. There's no guarantee that users will add speedies to the VfD page anyway. Besides, so many of the pages I add as speedies are just newbie experiments. There's really no need for a vote on them. You're right in that it's not well advertised. I should've made it more obvious. I'll see what I can do. I just figured taking a more pro-active approach would be good, since Wikipedians seem to want to discuss everything for ages. If I find my stuff getting reverted, then I'll know there's a problem. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 00:48, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

:The old procedure was pretty ambiguous, but the way I read it was that it was expected that speedies would be listed on the VfD page too, although some contributors didn't do it. I don't have a problem with your change, but you have to be cautious with changes to policy (yes, I know it's frustrating ;). That is, you should be bolder in your edits of individual books than with Wikibooks policy pages. My own disagreement over the correct naming of the ingredients pages in the Cookbook with [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] caused unneeded friction, and rather than getting into a move war, I just walked away (but, you may not be so fortunate).

Well. It was slightly ambiguous. This is one of the problems I'm trying to address, but there's a lot of content here, and it's gonna take time to sort out. It's obvious that Wikibooks != Wikipedia, and the policies copied from Wikipedia to Wikibooks aren't gonna work here (particularly with naming conventions). If you wanna see what's going on in my head, take a look at [[User:Aya/Wikibooks]]. As for the page [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], the section entitled [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Procedure for deletion|Procedure for deletion]] states:

:::Pages (and images) to be deleted should be listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] for a week before deletion takes place. That way, other [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] can have a chance to argue for and against the removal of the page. There are a few, limited, exceptions to this rule:

:::1. No meaningful content or history (eg &quot;sdhgdf&quot;).
:::2. Test pages (eg &quot;Can I really create a page here?&quot;).
:::3. Pure vandalism (see [[Wikibooks:dealing with vandalism|dealing with vandalism]]).
:::4. Very short pages with no definition or context (eg &quot;This guy is great!&quot;) or that only have an external link.
:::5. Reposting previously deleted content, where the page was not listed on [[Wikibooks:votes for undeletion|votes for undeletion]].
:::6. A user's own user page or his/her own user subpages.

I intepret this to mean that any pages meeting the numbered criteria should NOT be added to the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]], but should instead be either deleted immediately (if you have the privs), or added as a speedy candidate if you don't. So this is the way I have re-worded the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]], merely to keep it consistent with policy. I may re-word the policy page to make it clearer, but I felt I'd just try changing the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] to match policy before changing it, just to see what reaction I got from other users. To be honest, I don't think many other users care that much at all, and there's only a very small hardcore of 'power users' such as yourself and Lynx7225 who even read these pages at all.

By the way: check whatever template it is you use to sign your name. I had to change &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to prevent subscriping of all following text. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 15:52, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks, I've fixed the typo in my signature, I think. Yes, Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, but it's still a Wikimedia project. It is desirable for all Wikimedia projects have the same policies wherever possible, because that makes it easier for users to move between projects. If we make our policy different, just because we can, then we will forever be confusing these new users, and we will have to clean up their mess. [[m:Main Page|Metawiki]] is there for deciding policy that affect all Wikimedia projects, and it's only a matter of time before we will be asked to conform. Some policy that will always differ from Wikipedia and other projects is that to do with what Wikibooks is not, we must clearly define what belongs here (and enforce it). If we don't, then it makes the job of administration far more difficult.

I'm hoping that someone watches that. If not then I may just give up completely. It just seems a shame that there are many trustworthy and attentive users such as yourself who have the best intentions to help out in an administrative capacity, but the system only serves to ensure that it can never happen.

:::I just gotta add something here.  According to Jimbo, it wasn't supposed to be all that hard to become an admin.  The main issues were that a user had to show that he/she had a firm grasp of Wikimedia Foundation policies, and in particular becoming an admin of a particular project had to show that you tended to help out more than you hurt (hopefully much more so).  That you should be involved actively in a particular project (like Wikibooks, not just a particular book) to some degree with a substantial number of edits (no specific number required) to show that you understand basic editing policies on the project.
:::IMHO the process of becoming an admin has been glorified way too much.  At this point '''I''' don't care if I become an admin, but I don't think it should be a major undertaking.  If the real purpose of the voting page to become an admin was a popularity contest, it is a failure anyway.  It is more like you have to be an agressive user who has done a good job searching all of the pages here at Wikibooks just to find the darn thing, and even then I for one hardly even take a look at it.
:::My previous experience with similar social structures involved the Open Directory Project, where the &quot;admins&quot; (or in that case they were called &quot;metas&quot;) took their power way overboard and have all but killed the entire concept.  Old editors are fleeing and new editors are getting squashed.  I tried to get some enthusiastic new volunteers &quot;promoted&quot;, but my words fell on deaf ears.  The one nice thing I like about the Wikimedia Foundation board is that they are very approachable dispite the huge number of volunteers in all of the projects, and if a particular admin is being particularly harsh (like seems to be happening at Wikinews), they do accept appeals to step in and at least add a couple of more admins if necessary.
:::I don't have any real beef against the current group of admins on Wikibooks, and indeed they are doing a fair job, but I would like to see a couple more people gain admin status. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:16, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:: Yeah, voting for adminship does appear to have become more a popularity contest than simply choosing people who are willing to help out with Wikibooks as a whole, and that don't bite other users excessively. It's a bit like VfD in a way, whereby books are being kept simply because the voters liked it, and without consideration for Wikibook's policy. I think that we do need more admins, to bring up the number that are active at any given time (on the lookout for vandalism and to vote on VfD). I don't have any complaints about our existing admins, and you can't force them to be more active, they are volunteers after all.

: You're both correct, and I intend to spend less time talking about the problems, and more time taking on the responsibility of solving them. As a consequence I'm going to attempt to get myself bureaucrat status on this wiki (I think I've even found someone on Meta who can actually get this done), and get some more admins in place ASAP (I believe you'd both make fine candidates). I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting fed up with having to continually revert these automated linkspam attacks, when I (or others) could just block them. Especially now our beloved 'ass pus' perpetrator seems to have returned again. See [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Aya]] for the gory details.

:Thanks. On second thoughts, maybe the newest editor chopped out too much information. Maybe, I'll leave it protected for a little while before unprotecting it.

== Template protection request ==

Since it would be easy to get an admin to unprotect this... and because they are use so much and in so many place throughout Wikibooks, I am requesting that the following templates be placed under protection:

*[[Template:Stage]]
*[[Template:Stage short]]

This was an avenue for vandalism in the last attack that can be prevented, and I don't see a legitimate reason to change these templates without a wiki-wide discussion first anyway that would also involve an admin.

Thanks in advance for considering this. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:16, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:Done. I don't know if I'm supposed to do it without consulting the others, but it's easily undone. As a rule, however, protecting pages is really supposed to be our last resort. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::I'm pointing out that how pervasive these template is used throughout Wikibooks (I bet this snipped of text is accessed more than just about any other piece here) and the fact that I can't see any realistic reason to even change the format of this template without a major discussion, they do need protection.  In the last Ass Pus attack, some well-meaning but uninformed new user went through and deleted this template from Wikijunior Solar System (quite a bit of work BTW as it was used about 30 times there), and I bet that happened in some other areas of Wikibooks as well... which is one of my motivations.  I would suggest that the images of 00%.png, 25%.png, 50%.png, 75%.png, and 100%.png should also be protected, but that is more likely to be updated in some expaned guesstimation of the status of a Wikibook.  I'll go ahead and take the heat on this one if somebody complains, but I highly doubt that will be a problem.  Besides, the protection is also in the logs, and as you've said it can be undone very easy. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:41, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

== Rollback ==

I can't figure this out. How is it you manage to auto-rollback more than one revision in a page's history? For example, your recent rollback to [[The Final Fantasy Legend]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:41, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


: It doesn't work 100% of the time for some reason. But, you simply go to the history and then check beside the revision that you want to revert to, and then find the diff (handy to see if any damage has actually been done, newbies will often make several edits, and then fix them all). You should have the rollback link on the top right of the screen, and the revision you want to revert to on the top left (if not, then it won't work this time), simply click on the link, and that's it. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:49, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


Weird. I tested that on the sandbox, to revert all the way back to Pieman's last edit, but it didn't work. I think it may only work when the last few edits were all made by the same user. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:54, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


Confirmed. All edits must have been made from the same user. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:57, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


: That would make sense. I've also found that when reviewing a user's contributions, hitting the rollback link beside their final edit to the page will revert all of their (contiguous) edits to that page. I've just tested it on myself, and it works. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:10, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


I also suspect that regardless of which revision you diff against amongst the previous user's contiguous edits, it will ''always'' rollback them all. Note that I can't find any documentation about this on Meta at all. Typical. :-)

Perhaps we should use this thread to start the beginnings of an &quot;administrators guide&quot;, especially considering the number of new admins that have been added recently, and those still in the pipeline. It also ought to point out when blocking users is okay. I was slightly annoyed when I noticed [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] [[Special:Log/block|blocked]] a [[Special:Contributions/151.204.136.74|newbie]] for 3 days for [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook&amp;diff=212955&amp;oldid=207619 this edit] to the [[Cookbook]]. In his defence, he may have foolishly believed the reverter's incorrect assertion that this user was a 'vandal', but admins really ought to check these sorts of things. Luckily I was watching it all on the IRC system, so I could unblock the user within 5 minutes of the block. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:34, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

: A set of guidelines for administrators would be a good idea. I'm carrying on the way I did before I became an administrator, and it may not be entirely correct. It is understandable that Albert over did it a bit, because he has been out of the loop for a while. I think that we need to reiterate that suspected vandals should be dealt with carefully, just revert their edits without comment, only warn them on them talk page if they persist, and only block them if they ignore a warning. In practice, I silently rollback everything but the most persistant vandalism. We don't wan't to frighten off casual experimeners, and we don't want to encorage attention seeking vandals by overreacting either. Our goal should be to fix vandalism as quickly as possible, so that others can see that the behaviour will not be accepted, and that their efforts are in vain. PS: I see that you are using the Wikibooks indentation scheme. I though that it was being largly ignored. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:12, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm thinking something like this for the casual vandal:

# For a first offence, just silently revert. If it looks more like a newbie experiment than a vandal, then stick the &quot;test&quot; template on their user talk page. We don't want to encourage attention-seeking vandals by putting messages on their talk page.
# If they should continue, warn that subsequent transgressions will result in a block.
# If they still don't listen, block for a small amount of time (24h?)
# After this, increase length of block, but I'm not certain an infinite block is a good idea for the casual vandal.

Exceptions to this are scripted linkspam attempts - zero tolerance to this, so infinite block. Ditto with this AP vandal.

Although there's still the issue of how to tell the difference between a newbie experiment and a vandal.

I prefer the other indentation scheme, but I use this scheme when the depth of nesting hits about 6 or 7. I think this scheme can get a little confusing when there's more than two users in the conversation. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:06, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

: That sounds sensible. It's hard to tell a vandal from an experimenter, but we should err on the side of caution. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for the offer, but I would rather stick with Geocachernemesis, because that is what I am known as on many other Wikimedia projects (also, Geo is already taken on Wikipedia).

Assistive Technology is a generic term including assistive, adaptive and enabling and rehabilitative devices and the process used in selecting, locating and using them. Assistive technologies include: 
mechanical, electronic, and microprocessor based equipment: This includes microcomputers, electronic communication devices and other sophisticated devices. Non-mechanical and non-electronic aids: For example, a ramp to replace steps would fit in this category. Specialized instructional materials, services and strategies: Large print for persons with visual impairments is one example of specialized instructional material. Augmentative communication system - Any system that aids individuals who are not independent verbal communicators. The system can include speech, gestures, sign language, symbols, synthesized speech, dedicated communication aids or microcomputers. 


There are many companies that specialize in assistive technology the links below are just a few.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Abnormal psychology is the study of abnormal behavior in order to describe, predict, explain, and change abnormal patterns of functioning. Abnormal psychology studies the nature of psychopathology and its causes, and this knowledge is applied in clinical psychology to treating patients with psychological disorders.

There are a number of disorders and dysfunctions which are outside of the norm. Disorders and dysfunctions can be found within the Diagnostic classification system used by mental health professionals, called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), currently in the Fourth edition. The diagnostic classification system has its advantages and also has criticisms. However, it is used well enough to be considered a standard.

== Conclusion ==

One disorder that has attracted a great deal of attention is Autism or the Autism Spectrum of Disorders. 

Autism spectrum disorders include five specific diagnostic categories: Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, Rhett’s syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. These disorders have different criteria as found in the DSM IV, however, they fall under a spectrum of disorders that are developmental, usually presenting symptoms by the age of 3, with impairment in the following areas: 1) communication, 2) social functioning, and 3) restricted or repetitive interests, activities or stereotyped behavior.

Autism occurs in as many as 1 in 500 people with boys affected about 4 times as often as girls. It is the fastest growing category within special education. The causes are unknown, but it appears that there is a biological disorder in the form of abnormal brain development, structure and/or neurochemistry.

Most supported by research as effective are the use of early identification and interventions, specialized and individualized education, interventions with behavioral or applied behavior analysis approaches and other methods supported by well designed and peer reviewed research. Medications can be helpful for some symptom management, as well. Avoid basing your beliefs on celebrities with T.V. exposure, gurus and pundits with claims of miraculous cures or unconventional points of view who bypass the research peer review process or who fail to withstand it.

Some programs using behavioral approaches: *ABA, TEACCH, LEAP

== Noun ==

'''&quot;A Naming word.&quot;'''

A noun, or noun substantive, is a word or phrase that refers to a person, place, thing, event, substance or quality. Nouns are parts of speech and can be classified in different ways such as proper nouns (e.g. &quot;Janet&quot;) versus common nouns (e.g. &quot;girl&quot;), or collective nouns (e.g. &quot;bunch&quot;, &quot;herd&quot;). Nouns can be substituted by pronouns (e.g. &quot;she&quot; and &quot;which&quot;). The word noun derives from Latin nomen meaning &quot;name&quot; (as a noun can be considered an object, person, or concept's name).

Further classifications include the distinction between concrete nouns and abstract nouns. Concrete nouns refer to definite objects (e.g. chair, apple, Janet) and abstract nouns refer to ideas or concepts (e.g. justice, liberty). While sometimes useful, the boundaries between these two are not always clear.

In sentences, nouns occur in several different ways, the most common being as subjects (performers of action), or objects (recipients of action). In the sentence &quot;John wrote me a letter&quot;, &quot;John&quot; is a subject; &quot;me&quot; and &quot;letter&quot; are objects (of which &quot;letter&quot; is a noun and &quot;me&quot; a pronoun).</text>

{{cooknav}}

These are a few things to consider when reading a recipe you intend to try to cook.

==Read The Recipe==

Yes that would be the first step, wouldn't it? Read it - ''all of it'', carefully. Make sure that you have all the ingredients in the ingredients list. Make sure that there aren't any ingredients required by the text of the recipe that aren't mentioned in the ingredients list (a ''major'' faux pas, but it happens to the best of us).

Look at how the different ingredients need to be prepared. Do the onions need to be chopped, diced, irradiated with alpha particles, soaked in 12 year old Australian wine for six days and nights, or what? The difference between halved tomatoes and diced tomatoes can make or break a dish. How you prepare your ingredients is half the battle.

Next, does the recipe call for tools? How specifically? Generally if a good recipe mentions a tool very specifically there is a reason. If it's a really good recipe that reason will be spelled out. By the same token, if the tool is only mentioned vaguely or not directly mentioned at all then you should be safe using whatever you like.

Next comes timing. How long will it take to prepare the various ingredients? How long will it take to prepare the whole recipe? This can be important. You don't want to put the biscuits into the oven at the same time as the turkey - one of these items will be finished a long time before the other and both are best served warm.

==Prepare Your Ingredients==

All right. You have all the tools and ingredients you need, you have the recipe handy, and you're ready to cook. First things first, you must prepare your ingredients. If you need half an onion diced, a bell pepper in strips, and two potatoes cubed, you don't want to be doing that while trying to cook. It will only distract you and create an unnecessary opportunity for you to make a mistake. Prepare all your ingredients before you begin cooking. It will make you happier in the long run and the happier you are the healthier you are. If the recipe calls for a preheated oven, this is probably the time for that as well (see note).

Now that you have all your ingredients prepared, glance at the recipe once more. The term &quot;divided&quot; may be used, which means that the item will be used more than once during preparation, so this is an important reason for CAREFULLY re-reading the recipe. Make sure you haven't forgotten anything. Now you can continue to cook in accordance with your recipe.

==Look Beyond The Recipe==

Yes, recipes are a good and necessary thing. They allow us to accrue knowledge about cooking. However, as a Mr. Einstein once put it, &quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge.&quot; Even if you know nothing at all about cooking, stop and think about what you are doing. A little bit of creative thought can make a dish made from any recipe an original masterpiece.

==Notes==

On pre-heating ovens: If you are cooking in an oven it is nearly always necessary to preheat that oven. The problem here is twofold:
:#Many cooks do not preheat their ovens properly, or don't preheat them at all.
:#Many cooks think they are preheating properly when they are not.

When the pre-heat light on an oven turns off all that means is that the air temperature near the probe in the oven has reached the desired temperature. When you open the oven door a large part of that heat energy comes billowing out and, because the oven walls are still relatively cool, the oven takes between five and ten minutes to recover to its original temperature. The solution is to allow your oven to sit (unopened) for fifteen to twenty minutes after the preheating light turns off to allow the oven walls to absorb heat, thus reducing recovery time.

Consider how old the recipe is. A recipe from 1928 is likely to be different than a 1998 recipe. You may need a dictionary to determine what the ingredients are and if you can still get them. Note that many old recipes assume that you already know how to prepare them, listing only the ingredients. Some trial and error (as well as substitutions) may be needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 5.0  Index Investments ==

Is there a place for index investments in a portfolio?  Yes there is.  Individuals still working and saving in 401 or 403 plans can definitely make use of index investments vehicles.  Since index investments outperform the majority of actively managed mutual funds, it makes a lot of sense to reduce costs and go the index route.  Even for investors saving money outside of a tax-deferred account would do well to consider adding index investments to their portfolio options.

If one goes back and reviews the original portfolio plan there are many different asset classes to populate.  We have large-cap value and growth, mid-cap value and growth, small-cap value and growth, international including emerging markets, REITs, bonds, precious metals, cash etc.  It is nearly impossible for one investor to be expert in all these different asset classes.  Furthermore, if one is using NAIC methods for screening, selecting, and analyzing stocks, it is very difficult to find sufficient stocks to populate the value asset classes.  This is where index investments such as iShares play an important role in portfolio construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Ada/Navigation|Subprograms}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In Ada the subprograms are classified into two categories: [[#Procedures|procedures]] and [[#Functions|functions]]. A procedures call is a statement and does not return any value, whereas a function returns a value and must therefore be a part of an expression.

Subprogram parameters may have three modes.

; {{Ada/kw|in}}: The actual parameter value goes into the call and is not changed there. The formal parameter is a constant and allows only reading. This is the default when no mode is given. The actual parameter is an expression.
; {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}}: The actual parameter goes into the call and may be redefined. The formal parameter is a variable and can be read and written.
; {{Ada/kw|out}}: The actual parameter's value before the call is irrelevant, it will get a value in the call. The formal parameter can be read and written. (In Ada 83 {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters were write-only.)

A parameter of any mode may also be explicitly {{Ada/kw|aliased}}.

; {{Ada/kw|access}}: The formal parameter is an access (a pointer) to some variable. (This is not a parameter mode from the reference manual point of view.)

Note that parameter modes do not specify the parameter passing method. Their purpose is to document the data flow.

The parameter passing method depends on the type of the parameter. A rule of thumb is that parameters fitting into a register are passed by copy, others are passed by reference. For certain types, there are special rules, for others the parameter passing mode is left to the compiler (which you can assume to do what is most sensible). Tagged types are always passed by reference.

Explicitly {{Ada/kw|aliased}} parameters and {{Ada/kw|access}} parameters specify pass by reference.

Unlike in the C class of programming languages, Ada subprogram calls cannot have empty parameters parentheses &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/dl|(}} {{Ada/dl|)}}&lt;/code&gt; when there are no parameters.

== Procedures ==

A procedure call in Ada constitutes a statement by itself.

For example:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} A_Test {{Ada/dl|(}}A, B: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer; C: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    C := A + B;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} A_Test;

When the procedure is called with the statement
 A_Test (5 + P, 48, Q);
the expressions 5 + P and 48 are evaluated (expressions are only allowed for in parameters), and then assigned to the formal parameters A and B, which behave like constants. Then, the value A + B is assigned to formal variable C, whose value will be assigned to the actual parameter Q when the procedure finishes.

C, being an {{Ada/kw|out}} parameter, is an uninitialized variable before the first assignment. (Therefore in Ada 83, there existed the restriction that {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters are write-only. If you wanted to read the value written, you had to declare a local variable, do all calculations with it, and finally assign it to C before return. This was awkward and error prone so the restriction was removed in Ada 95.)

Within a procedure, the return statement can be used without arguments to exit the procedure and return the control to the caller.

For example, to solve an equation of the kind &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Elementary_Functions}};
 {{Ada/kw|use}}  {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Elementary_Functions}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Quadratic_Equation
    {{Ada/dl|(}}A, B, C :     Float;   {{Ada/--|By default it is &quot;in&quot;.}}
     R1, R2  : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
     Valid   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean{{Ada/dl|)}}
 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Z : Float;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Z := B**2 - 4.0 * A * C;
    {{Ada/kw|if}} Z &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|or}} A = 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
       Valid := False;  {{Ada/--|Being out parameter, it should be modified at least once.}}
       R1    := 0.0;
       R2    := 0.0;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       Valid := True;
       R1    := (-B + Sqrt (Z)) / (2.0 * A);
       R2    := (-B - Sqrt (Z)) / (2.0 * A);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Quadratic_Equation;

The function SQRT calculates the square root of non-negative values.  If the roots are real, they are given back in R1 and R2, but if they are complex or the equation degenerates (A = 0), the execution of the procedure finishes after assigning to the Valid variable the False value, so that it is controlled after the call to the procedure.  Notice that the {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters should be modified at least once, and that if a mode is not specified, it is implied {{Ada/kw|in}}.

== Functions ==

A function is a subprogram that can be invoked as part of an expression. Until Ada 2005, functions can only take {{Ada/kw|in}} (the default) or {{Ada/kw|access}} parameters; the latter can be used as a work-around for the restriction that functions may not have {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters. Ada 2012 has removed this restriction.

Here is an example of a function body:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} A;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} B;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Minimum;

Or in Ada2012:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|return}} ({{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}} A {{Ada/kw|else}} B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Minimum;

or even shorter as an ''expression function''

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} ({{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}} A {{Ada/kw|else}} B);

The formal parameters with mode {{Ada/kw|in}} behave as local constants whose values are provided by the corresponding actual parameters.  The statement {{Ada/kw|return}} is used to indicate the value returned by the function call and to give back the control to the expression that called the function.  The expression of the {{Ada/kw|return}} statement may be of arbitrary complexity and must be of the same type declared in the specification.  If an incompatible type is used, the compiler gives an error.  If the restrictions of a subtype are not fulfilled, e.g. a range, it raises a Constraint_Error exception.

The body of the function can contain several {{Ada/kw|return}} statements and the execution of any of them will finish the function, returning control to the caller.  If the flow of control within the function branches in several ways, it is necessary to make sure that each one of them is finished with a {{Ada/kw|return}}
statement.  If at run time the end of a function is reached without encountering a {{Ada/kw|return}} statement, the exception Program_Error is raised.  Therefore, the body of a function must have at least one such {{Ada/kw|return}}
statement.

Every call to a function produces a new copy of any object declared within it.  When the function finalizes, its objects disappear.  Therefore, it is possible to call the function recursively.  For example, consider this implementation of the factorial function:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Factorial (N : Positive) {{Ada/kw|return}} Positive {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} N = 1 {{Ada/kw|then}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} 1;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} (N * Factorial (N - 1));
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Factorial;

When evaluating the expression &lt;code&gt;Factorial (4);&lt;/code&gt; the function
will be called with parameter 4 and within the function it will
try to evaluate the expression &lt;code&gt;Factorial (3)&lt;/code&gt;, calling itself as a function, but in this case parameter N would be 3 (each call copies the parameters) and so on until N = 1 is evaluated which will finalize the recursion and then the expression will begin to be completed in the reverse order.

A formal parameter of a function can be of any type, including vectors or
records.  Nevertheless, it cannot be an anonymous type, that is, its
type must be declared before, for example:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Float_Vector {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Float;
 
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Add_Components (V: Float_Vector) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Result : Float := 0.0;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} V'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       Result := Result + V(I);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
    {{Ada/kw|return}} Result;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Add_Components;

In this example, the function can be used on a vector of arbitrary dimension.
Therefore, there are no static bounds in the parameters passed to the
functions. For example, it is possible to be used in the following
way:

 V4  : Float_Vector (1 .. 4) := (1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8);
 Sum : Float;
 
 Sum := Add_Components (V4);

In the same way, a function can also return a type whose bounds are not known a priori. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Invert_Components (V : Float_Vector) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float_Vector {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Result : Float_Vector(V'{{Ada/attribute|Range}});   {{Ada/--|Fix the bounds of the vector to be returned.}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} V'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       Result(I) := V (V'{{Ada/attribute|First}} + V'{{Ada/attribute|Last}} - I);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
    {{Ada/kw|return}} Result;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Invert_Components; 

The variable Result has the same bounds as V, so the returned vector will always have the same dimension as the one passed as parameter.

A value returned by a function can be used without assigning it to a variable, it can be referenced as an expression.  For example, &lt;code&gt;Invert_Components (V4) (1)&lt;/code&gt;, where the first element of the vector returned by the function would be obtained (in this case, the last element of V4, i.e. 7.8).

== Named parameters ==

In subprogram calls, named parameter notation (i.e. the name of the formal
parameter followed of the symbol {{Ada/dl|1= =&gt;}} and then the actual parameter) allows the rearrangement of the parameters in the call. For example:

 Quadratic_Equation (Valid =&gt; OK, A =&gt; 1.0, B =&gt; 2.0, C =&gt; 3.0, R1 =&gt; P, R2 =&gt; Q);
 F := Factorial (N =&gt; (3 + I));

This is especially useful to make clear which parameter is which.

 Phi := Arctan (A, B);
 Phi := Arctan (Y =&gt; A, X =&gt; B);

The first call (from Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions) is not very clear. One might easily confuse the parameters. The second call makes the meaning clear without any ambiguity.

Another use is for calls with numeric literals:

 Ada.Float_Text_IO.Put_Line (X, 3, 2, 0);  -- ?
 Ada.Float_Text_IO.Put_Line (X, Fore =&gt; 3, Aft =&gt; 2, Exp =&gt; 0);  -- OK

== Default parameters ==

On the other hand, formal parameters may have default values. They can, therefore, be omitted in the subprogram call. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} By_Default_Example (A, B: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer := 0);

can be called in these ways:

 By_Default_Example (5, 7);      {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 5, B = 7&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example (5);         {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 5, B = 0&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example;             {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 0, B = 0&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example (B =&gt; 3);    {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 0, B = 3&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example (1, B =&gt; 2); {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 1, B = 2&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

In the first statement, a &quot;regular call&quot; is used (with positional association); the second also uses positional association but omits the second parameter to use the default; in the third statement, all parameters are by default; the fourth statement uses named association to omit the first parameter; finally, the fifth statement uses mixed association, here the positional parameters have to precede the named ones.

Note that the default expression is evaluated once for each formal parameter that has no actual parameter. Thus, if in the above example a function would be used as defaults for A and B, the function would be evaluated once in case 2 and 4; twice in case 3, so A and B could have different values; in the others cases, it would not be evaluated.

== Renaming ==

Subprograms may be renamed. The parameter and result profile for a renaming-as-declaration must be mode conformant.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Solve
   (A, B, C: {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
    R1, R2 : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
    Valid  : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean) {{Ada/kw|renames}} Quadratic_Equation;

This may be especially comfortable for tagged types.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Some_Package {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Message_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print (Message: {{Ada/kw|in}} Message_Type);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Some_Package; 

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Some_Package;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Message: Some_Package.Message_Type;
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print {{Ada/kw|renames}} Message.Print;  {{Ada/--|this has convention intrinsic, see RM 6.3.1(10.1/2)}}
   &lt;s&gt;Method_Ref: {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} := Print'{{Ada/kw|Access}};&lt;/s&gt;  {{Ada/--|thus taking 'Access should be illegal; GNAT GPL 2012 allows this}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}  {{Ada/--|All these calls are equivalent:}}
   Some_Package.Print (Message);  {{Ada/--|traditional call without use clause}}
   Message.Print;                 {{Ada/--|Ada 2005 method.object call - note: no use clause necessary}}
   Print;                         {{Ada/--|Message.Print is a parameterless procedure and can be renamed as such}}
   &lt;s&gt;Method_Ref.{{Ada/kw|all}};&lt;/s&gt;                {{Ada/--|GNAT GPL 2012 allows illegal call via an access to the renamed procedure Print}}
                                  {{Ada/--|This has been corrected in the current version (as of Nov 22, 2012)}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

But note that &lt;code&gt;Message.Print'{{Ada/kw|Access}};&lt;/code&gt; is illegal, you have to use a renaming declaration as above.

Since only mode conformance is required (and not full conformance as between specification and body), parameter names and default values may be changed with renamings:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure }}P (X: {{Ada/kw|in }}Integer :=  0);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure }}R (A: {{Ada/kw|in }}Integer := -1) {{Ada/kw|renames }}P;

*'''Core'''
*CPU: Nintendo custom '5A22', believed to be produced by Ricoh; based around a 16-bit CMD/GTE 65c816 (a clone of the Western Design Center 65816). [Edit note: 65c816 was made by Western Design Center by William D. Mensch. CMD/GTE was a licensee] The CPU runs the 65c816-alike core with a variable-speed bus, with bus access times determined by addresses accessed, with a maximum theoretical effective clock rate around 3.58 MHz.  The SNES/SFC provided the CPU with 128 KB of Work RAM.

*The CPU also contains other support hardware, including:
** for interfacing with controller ports;
** for generating NMI interrupts on Vertical blanking interval;
** for generating IRQ interrupts on screen positions;
** Direct memory access unit, supporting two primary modes, general DMA (for block transfers, at a rate of 2.68MB/second) and Horizontal blanking interval DMA (for transferring small data sets at the end of each scanline, outside of the active display period);
** multiplication and division registers.

*Cartridge Size Specifications: 2 - 32 Megabits(Mb) which ran at two speeds ('SlowROM' and 'FastROM'). Custom address decoders allow larger sizes, eg. 48 Mb for ''Star Ocean'' and ''Tales of Phantasia''

*'''Sound'''
**Sound Controller Chip: 8-bit Sony SPC700 CPU for controlling the Digital signal processor running at an effective clock rate around 1.024 MHz.
**Main Sound Chip: 8-channel Sony S-DSP with hardware ADPCM decompression, pitch modulation, echo effect with feedback (for reverberation) with 8-tap FIR filter, and ADSR and 'GAIN' (discretely controlled) volume envelopes.
**Memory Cycle Time: 279 Minutes
**Sound RAM: 512 kilobit(Kb) shared between SPC700 and S-DSP.
**Pulse Code Modulator: 16-Bit ADPCM (using 4-bit compressed ADPCM samples, expanded to 15-bit resolution, processed with an additional 4-point Gaussian sound interpolation).
** Note - while not directly related to SNES hardware, the standard extension for SNES audio subsystem state files saved by emulators is SPC_sound_format(.spc), a format used by SPC players.

*'''Video'''
**Picture Processor Unit: 15-Bit
**Video RAM: 64 KB of VRAM for screen maps (for 'background' layers) and tile sets (for backgrounds and objects); 512 + 32 bytes of 'OAM' (Object Attribute Memory) for objects; 512 bytes of 'CGRAM' for palette data.
**Palette: 256 entries; 15-Bit color (BGR555) for a total of 32,768 colors.
**Maximum colors per layer per scanline: 256.
**Maximum colors on-screen: 32,768 (using color arithmetic for transparency effects).
**Resolution: between 256x224 and 512x448. Most games used 256x224 pixels since higher resolutions caused slowdown, flicker, and/or had increased limitations on layers and colors (due to memory bandwidth constraints); the higher resolutions were used for less processor-intensive games, in-game menus, text, and high resolution images.
**Maximum onscreen objects (sprites): 128 (32 per line, up to 34 8x8 tiles per line).
**Maximum number of sprite pixels on one scanline: 256. The renderer was designed such that it would drop the ''frontmost'' sprites instead of the rearmost sprites if a scanline exceeded the limit, allowing for creative clipping effects.
**Most common display modes: Pixel-to-pixel text mode 1 (16 colors per tile; 3 scrolling layers) and affine mapped text mode 7 (256 colors per tile; one rotating/scaling layer).

A '''blender''' is a kitchen appliance used to blend ingredients or [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] food. The term typically refers to a stationary, upright electrical device, which is to be distinguished from a hand-powered or electric mixer that may be used for similar purposes.

A typical blender will be built around a vessel for the ingredients to be blended. At the top of the vessel will be a cap to prevent ingredients from escaping when the blender is switched on. At the bottom will be a blade assembly, typically removable for cleaning purposes. The bottom seal will most likely be watertight. The vessel will rest upon a base containing a motor (for turning the blade assembly) with controls on its surface. Most modern blenders will offer a number of possible speeds.

A '''wand blender''' (also known as a hand or stick blender) differs from a standard blender. It does not have a bowl, and its blade is situated at one end of a long stick, this allows it to be used to purée foods in their own containers (e.g., in [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepans]] while still on the stove top).

Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Ingredients==

* 4 medium [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillos]], husked and rinsed (or used canned if unavailable)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], stemmed 
* 1/2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled and quartered 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] clove, peeled 
* 1 handful fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, coarsely chopped 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], juiced 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasted]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds 
* Kosher (coarse or margarita) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [60ml] (1/2 stick) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* 1/4 cup all-purpose [60ml] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (480ml) [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]], at room temperature 
* 4 cups shredded (950ml) [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]] 
* 1 (1-[[Cookbook:Pound|pound]]) (450g) bag salted corn tortilla chips 
* 1 (3-pound) whole (1350g) [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] chicken, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] finely shredded, skin and bones discarded

'''Quick [[Cookbook:Salsa|Salsa]]:'''

* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (570ml) cherry [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], halved 
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], white and green parts, chopped 
* 1 jalapeño, chopped 
* 2 handfuls fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, hand shredded 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Lime|limes, juiced]] 
* Kosher (coarse or margarita) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] 

* [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]] and [[Cookbook:Guacamole|guacamole]], for serving

==Preparation==

Bring a pot of water to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]]; add the tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, and garlic. [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 10 to 15 minutes, until the tomatillos are soft. Drain and cool slightly, then put them in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]. Add the cilantro, lime juice, and cumin. [[Cookbook:Pureeing|Puree]] for a few seconds to blend, and then pour in about a 1/4 cup of water and process to a coarse puree; taste and season with a generous pinch of salt. You should have about 2 cups of this green salsa (''salsa verde''). 
Make a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] by melting the butter over medium-low heat in a thick-bottomed [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Just as the foam subsides, sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to remove the starchy taste from the flour; don't allow it to [[Cookbook:Browning|brown]]. Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and simmer for 8 minutes to thicken. Once you have a good base, fold in 2 cups of the shredded Jack cheese; mix until completely melted into a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. Stir in the prepared salsa verde until incorporated; remove the green chili cheese sauce from the heat. 

Make a quick salsa by combining the cherry tomatoes, onions, jalapeño, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl; season with salt and pepper, tossing to combine. 

To build these awesome nachos: Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350 degrees F]] (180c). Get a very large [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]-proof platter and cover it with a few handfuls of tortilla chips, follow with a portion of the shredded chicken, a coating of the cheese sauce, and a nice sprinkle of the remaining shredded jack. Make 3 or 4 layers of the nachos, depending on the size of the platter. Bake the nachos until they are all hot and gooey, about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Spoon the tomato salsa over the top of the nachos and serve with the sour cream on the side.

It will discuss a Professional Development Model for Technology Integration


== INTRODUCTION ==
Staff development models that usually focus on school improvement often deal with specific problems. For example, 
[http://michigan.gov/mde MEAP] scores are down, how do we improve? Teachers are often required to gain skills or knowledge in a certain area. The main objective in implementing professional development through a model would be to develop and implement a comprehensive model for technological professional development that facilitates technology integration into the curriculum. The model theory that I researched is  based on the simple fact that adults learn when they have a need to know or to help solve a real-life problem. (Knowles, 1980) Adults have a need to be self-directing. Adults bring a wealth of experience that should be used in a learning situation. Adults’ readiness to learn is based on a need to solve a problem. Adults want to make immediate application of knowledge. &lt;br&gt;
Advances in technology require that educators prepare students not only academically but also to meet the challenges of 21st century demands.  Recent studies have shown that teachers are fully aware of the need for their students to be prepared for the rapid growth of the Information Society, and that it is their reponsibility to provide chidren with the opportunity to learn technology.(Loveless, 2004) We have to create personal learning experiences to encourage teachers to embrace this technology.  Pressures from high stakes testing has increased the demand for teachers to integrate technology in the classroom.Journals and research have suggested that integrating technology will promote better standardized test scores and motivate students to achieve in all areas of content. Many districts depend on state testing scores for funding and accreditation.  Schools are mandated by state and national levels to meet adequate yearly progress.  Educational software vendors proclaim that using their software will accommodate these issues regarding state and national requirements. In implementing technology and purchasing software, many decisions are focused on if the program be worth the money and would it help with high stakes testing?  Will our teachers be able to successfully implement this learning tool effectively and efficiently?

The Professional Development Plan was based on the principles of [[w:Instructional design|Instructional System Design.]]  The model expects that the four phases are done in order with a final assessment.

*'''Performance Analysis'''   
*'''Needs Assessment'''   
*'''Development and Implementation (professional development plan)'''    
*'''Assessment (impact of the professional development plan)'''

==Performance Analysis==

In my elementary environment teachers have to have meaning behind change. The teachers were not adequately prepared to use the new technology tools in instructions.
Often teachers don't fully use the technology that is available for productivity or integration.  Computers are left unused and computer labs are mainly used for drill and practice. Completing a performance analysis to determine how the current work environment is being utilized and making sure that monies spent on technology is being used effectively helps to determine the next step, which is the needs assessment.  

==Needs Assessment==
Surveys need to be prepared to determine the interests, values, and perspectives of the stakeholders. (stakeholders in this model included teachers, assistant teachers, students and parents)
Veteran teachers need to be surveyed on staff development preferences. New teachers would need to be surveyed to identify baseline skills.

==Development==
After a detailed analysis of the surveys to determine the needs and interest of the school staff. The goal is  to develop a long range plan which included professional development for the entire year. The yearly plan can contain detailed implementation for each objective.   Each objective should list indicators of success, measurement tools, plan of activities, responsible parties and completion dates.

==Assessment==
Pre-test should be at the being of the school semester.  Post- test should be completed in the spring. Both tests result data should remain confidential. The analysis should give a percentile score for example a beginner, intermediate, or advanced skill level for each teacher as well as an average for the entire staff. 

==Seels and Glasgow ISD Model II: For Practitioners==
Instructional systems design (ISD) is based on the premise that learning should not occur in a haphazard manner, but should be developed in accordance with orderly processes and have outcomes that can be measured. Basically, ISD requires defining what is to be learned, planning an intervention that will allow learning to occur, measuring learning to determine if objectives were met, and refining the intervention until objectives are met.

The Seels and Glasgow Model II: For Practitioners is a design model for practitioners that includes many of the components identified in this article.  Click the link to view the model [[Instructional Technology/Seels and Glasgow Model II|Seels and Glasgow Model II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In ship building and even other places, we need to decide on what load a particular structure will be able to bear. The objective of this course is to find out how to do this with reference to a ship in mind. The load can either be a static load as the dead weight or a dynamic load which causes vibrations. Both are detrimental to the structure and as such must be studied. 

To do so in an orderly manner, we will first consider only static load, and then move on to the study of vibrations in general.

Do not assume that everything is safe! Most will have some sort of safety advice on the page but the absence of written precautions does not mean that you can just go and play ahead. If you are an adult, you should use your own judgement and common sense. If you are a minor (child), it is highly recommended that you should ask for more advice and help from your teachers and parents.

'''Tempeh''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian]] food made from soybeans. It is a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] food, utilising a special type of mould that forms a cake. When fresh, tempeh has a nice mushroom-like smell and flavour.

==Ingredients==

* 400 grams (14 ounces) [[Cookbook:Soy|dried soybeans]]
* water for soaking the soybeans
* water for cooking the soybeans
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon tempeh starter (or ''ragi tempe'')

==Equipment==

* [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooker|Pressure cooker]] or [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], at least 3 litres (3 quarts)
* Large tray (or trays) for spreading cooked beans on to dry
* Banana leaves, zip-lock bags or shallow dishes for incubating the fermenting tempeh
* Somewhere warm to incubate the tempeh at about 30-35°C / 86-95°F (e.g. your oven, with the light on!)
* Thermometer (optional) for keeping a watch on the temperature of the incubator

==Procedure==
[[Image:Tempeh fava ready.jpg|thumb|right|Cooked fava beans, inoculated with starter and ready to ferment.]]

# Cover soybeans with water, and soak overnight or at least 12 hours.
# Remove the hulls (i.e. skins) from the beans by rubbing between both hands (see notes).
# Skim off most of the hulls either by washing them away or by using a [[Cookbook:Skimmer|skimmer]] or strainer. Some hulls may be left behind without affecting tempeh quality.
# Cook beans until just tender, not mushy; undercooked is best for tempeh (see notes).
# Drain beans, and spread to dry somewhere with airflow (see notes).
# Collect beans into a bowl, and mix in the cider vinegar. This acidifies the beans slightly, inhibiting unwanted spoilage organisms during fermentation.
# Sprinkle the tempeh starter over the beans and mix in well (see notes).
# Pack the beans loosely into banana leaves, zip-lock bags, or shallow dishes for incubating. Zip-lock bags must be punctured at roughly 1cm / &amp;frac12; inch intervals to keep oxygen up to the fermenting beans.

==Fermentation==

# Load the soon-to-be tempeh into your incubator, preferably on racks that will allow air circulation. An electric oven with a light on makes a pretty good incubator, because the light provides just enough heat to keep the beans warm while the fermentation starts happening.
# Incubate for 12 hours or so at around 30-35°C / 86-95°F with a heat source (unless it's already that hot where you are)
# After 12 hours, remove or turn off the heat source - the fermenting beans will be making their own heat, and may overheat if you keep them too warm
# Monitor periodically from then on, and remove when the beans are totally consumed by fluffy white tempeh with no gaps.
# After fermentation is complete, serve straight away in your favourite tempeh recipe, refrigerate for two to three days, or freeze for up to two months.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
[[Image:Tempeh tempe.jpg|thumb|right|Fresh tempeh at market, Jakarta, Indonesia]]
* Tempeh can be made from almost any legume (beans, chickpeas, split peas), most grains, and some nuts. Soybeans are probably one of the cheapest beans to use, but more flavoursome beans make more flavoursome tempeh!
* Tempeh can also be made from [[Cookbook:Okara|okara]], the presscake left over from making [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] and [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]. In Indonesia, this is called ''tempe gembus''.
* There are many ways to remove the hulls or skins from the beans, including:
** cracking dried beans in a grain mill and winnowing to remove hulls
** grinding soaked beans in hands
** rubbing soaked beans between both hands
** rubbing cooked beans between both hands (but don't get burnt!)
** buy them pre-hulled - e.g. [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chana dal]], [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|split fava beans]], [[Cookbook:Pea|split peas]]
* Soybeans can be cooked easily in a pressure cooker at 15psi for 10 minutes with slow-release method, or on a [[Cookbook:Rolling Boil|rolling boil]] for 30 minutes in a saucepan. Soft, ready-to-eat soybeans are not the target here, so don't cook too long.
* It can be difficult to distribute the teaspoonful of tempeh starter through the beans evenly. To make the job a little easier, mix the tempeh starter into a couple of tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] first, then sprinkle and stir this mixture into the beans a little at a time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cell holder''' is a simple device for holding 1.5V cells {[[w:battery (electricity)|batteries]]} for use in [[w:school|school]] laboratories. A cost-effective way of making simple cell units to use with 4mm leads, follows.

''See also'': [[../Bulb holder]], [[../Simple switches]].

===Equipment Required (to Make 60 Cell Holders)===

*60 pieces of [[w:wood|wood]] at least 120mm x 36mm and 20mm thick
*'D' cell plastic holder (available from most Design &amp; Technology suppliers)
*4mm terminals, 60 black and 60 red (available from most electrical component retailers)
*small [[w:screw|screw]]s to fit through the base of the cell holders
*Extra flexible lead [[w:wire|wire]], black and red
*[[w:Solder|Solder]] + [[w:soldering iron|soldering iron]]
*Pliers
*Screwdriver
*Drills 7.5mm, 5mm &amp; 3mm
*Countersink drill bit
*Solder Flux

[[Image:cellholderfin.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 2''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Cell Holder Complete with Cell''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

====Method for making the cell holders====

#Get the wood cut the wood to the correct size and sanded if need be.
#Drill 2 x 7.5mm holes at either end as show in ''fig 1''.&lt;br&gt;
#Drill 2 x 5 mm holes near those.
#Countersink the larger holes to about half way, so that you can attach the nut of the 4mm terminals.
#Insert the 4mm terminals in the larger holes, one of each colour in either end, and secure with nut.
#Attach the plastic cell holder with the 2 screws (diagonally opposite), first drilling holes, and making sure that the end with the spring goes near the black terminal.
#Cut a 5cm piece of each wire, strip the ends and solder onto the tags on the plastic cell holder, making sure you do not take to long or the tags will melt off. Ensure you have got red wire to the red terminal and black wire going to the black terminal. Then push the wire through the 5mm hole and out the other side so you can then solder it onto the 4mm terminal.
#It should look something like '''fig 2'''. these are usually very durable and can be used in conjuction with bulb holders etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article explains '''how to demonstrate the principles of hydraulics'''.

&lt;div style=&quot;float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Hydraulics_demo1.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Hydraulics_demo2.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

A good way of demonstrating the basic principles of [[w:hydraulic|hydraulic]]s is to join two syringes together with rubber tubing to make an watertight seal [see figure 1]. The syringes can be filled with water, oil, or just air. Pushing plunger A causes plunger B to move out and pushing plunger B in causes plunger A to move out. This works even if the syringes are not in the same plane. i.e. if the tubing is bent by 90&amp;deg; as long as there is no kink in the tube that prevents the free flow of fluid.

With syringes of different sizes it is possible to demonstrate how to multiply [[w:force|force]] [see figure 2]. A small mass on a small syringe can lift a much larger mass if it is resting on a bigger syringe. This is because the [[w:pressure|pressure]] in the two syringes is equal, but the surface areas of the two pistons are different, and force = pressure &amp;times; area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A graticule slide is a [[w:microscope|microscope]] slide that contains a mm grid of lines. They allow the size of objects seen under magnification to be measured. A simple version of a graticule slide can be made by anyone with access to a drawing program. Something as simple as the drawing tools that come with [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]] will do (''see instructions below'').

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[File:Graticule.png]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 1''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''[[w:vector graphics|vector]] [[w:Raster graphics|rasterized]]'' &lt;br /&gt; ''[[w:grid|grid]] (low quality)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Once there is a suitable grid on the computer [you ''could'' download the one to the side; see figure 1], a test print should be produced. The size of the printed square should be measured and the grid should be resized until a cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; grid is printed. This grid can now be printed on photocopiable OHP sheets.

The OHP sheets can be glued to a glass slide with clear nail varnish.

==Instructions to create a grid==
'''Use of Word drawing tools (in ''italics''''')

#In Word, go to view, toolbars. and make sure that 'Drawing' is ticked. Then select a line from the drawing tool pallet. [it is a picture of a line next to 'AutoShapes']
#Draw a single straight, vertical line. Copy and paste the line 9 times.
#Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to line up the lines so that you have 10 evenly spaced lines.
#Select all ten lines at once by holding down the shift key and left clicking on each line in turn.
#Go to Draw then Group, to group all ten lines into a single object.
#Copy then paste the lines then go to 'Draw' then 'Rotate or flip' and rotate by 90&amp;deg;
#Line up the vertical and horizontal lines and by using the corner tabs resize them until there is a perfect grid without any overhangs. Then select both sets of lines and group them together into one object.You should now have a square grid.

The opening paragraphs are simply wrong. Although Visking is a partially permeable membrane the molecular weight cut-off of Visking tubing is generally rated at 12-14kD. Sucrose or most other sugars would easily pass through this membrane which is why it is used as a model of the gut. That is starch is broken down by enzymes in the tube and sugars are allowed to pass through the membrane wall.

The osmosis experiment relates to something slightly different. It is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low one, aiming ultimately to equilibrium. Should there be a higher concentration of sugar solution inside of the membrane then the tendency would be for the water molecules to come into the membrane and a rise in the level of liquid in the capillary tube, in plant cells this would result in turgidity. Although the osmotic potential (into the membrane rather than out) may stop the sugars escaping they are small enough to come out and the dyes may well be seen in the outside bath. Similarly if the tubing contains a smaller concentration of sugars on the inside than the outside one would expect water to come out of the membrane leading to flaccidity but the concentration on the outside needs to be substantially higher and the sugars may still go through.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This '''apparatus for [[w:Osmosis demonstration|demonstrating osmosis]]''' through [[w:visking tubing|visking tubing]] (otherwise known as '''dialysis tubing''') and is widely used in [[w:school|school]]. Visking tubing is a [[w:semipermeable|semipermeable]] membrane that allows small [[w:molecule|molecule]]s like [[w:water|water]] to pass through but does not allow larger molecules like [[w:sugar|sugar]]. If [[w:solution|solution]]s of different [[w:concentration|concentration]] are on either side of the visking membrane, water molecules will pass through and tend to dilute the more concentrated solution.

The assembled equipment is inserted into [[w:hypotonic|hypotonic]], [[w:hypertonic|hypertonic]], and [[w:isotonic|isotonic]] solutions and the level on the capillary rises, falls, or stays level accordingly.  This apparatus is easy for school children to use, but is fiddly to set up. It can be set up by a [[w:school science technician|technician]] in advance.

== Apparatus ==
*0.5[[w:Metre|m]] length of [[w:capillary tube|capillary tube]] 
*10[[w:cm|cm]] of medium width visking tubing
*[[w:Bung|Bung]] with hole. The bung and visking tubing should be selected so that the tubing just fits over the bung.
*Rubber tubing (small and large [[w:bore|bore]])
*0.5[[w:Molar solution|M]] [[w:sucrose|sucrose]] solution
*Food [[w:dye|dye]] e.g. [[w:cochineal|cochineal]].
*[[w:Pipette|Pipette]]

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;[[File:Visking tubing osmosis app.svg]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Apparatus for &lt;br&gt; demonstrating osmosis''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(assembled)''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''Notes:'''&lt;br&gt;
a) capillary tube&lt;br&gt;
b) rubber band&lt;br&gt;
c) bung&lt;br&gt;
d) rubber band&lt;br&gt;
e) sucrose solution with food dye&lt;br&gt;
f) knotted visking tubing&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Setting up the Apparatus ==
# The visking tubing is softened under a running tap until it opens up. A knot should be tied at one end to make a bag.
#A bung that is just small enough to fit snugly inside the visking tubing is inserted into the unknotted end. Then a ring of a suitable bore rubber tubing is cut to make a band.This band is then slipped over the visking tubing so that it grips the tubing to the bung.
#The reason that food dye is added to the sucrose solution is to make the level in the capillary tube easy to see.
#The ''bag'' is filled completely to the brim with the coloured sucrose solution by squirting a pipette full at a time through the hole in the rubber bung. No [[w:air|air]] bubbles can remain. At this stage the knot and the attachment to the bung is checked for leaks. 
#The capillary tubing is then carefully inserted into the bung. The fit needs to be tight and the sucrose should come up about half way (see diagram). If the level is too high the visking bag can be '''gently''' squeezed to force a little solution out of the top of the capillary. If the level is too low, a [[w:dialysis clip|dialysis clip]] is attached just above the knot to reduce the volume of the bag.
#A ring from some narrow bore rubber tubing is cut and slippedover the capillary tube to act as a marker for the level.

==Method of Use==
'''A)''' Clamp the apparatus in a [[w:retort stand|retort stand]], then place into a large beaker of 0.5M sucrose (isotonic). Make sure the visking bag is hanging freely in the solution. I.e. not touching the sides or bottom. This stops it from being squashed and distorting the results.

'''B)''' Slide the rubber band to the top of the capillary level in order to mark the start position.Put the apparatus into 2.0M sucrose solution (hypertonic). The level in the capillary tube will fall as the water inside passes through the visking tubing in order to dilute the stronger solution outside.

'''C)''' Put the apparatus into [[w:distilled water|distilled water]] (hypotonic). The level in the capillary tube will rise as the water passes into the visking bag to dilute the stronger solution inside.

==Storage of the Apparatus==

The apparatus cannot be stored for more than a few days with the [[w:sugar|sugar]] solution inside, because it will go mouldy. The capillary tube should be removed and thoroughly rinsed as any sugar left inside will harden and block the tube. The visking bags can be left attached to the bungs but should be rinsed and stored in water or a mixture of water and [[w:ethanol|ethanol]] to keep the bag soft. If the visking dries out it may become brittle and crack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charles' law tubes''' allow the demonstration of [[w:Charles' law|Charles' law]] in a school lab.

Heat the tube in boiling water, drying oven or with a hot air gun and
place open end in clean [[w:mercury (element)|mercury]]. Allow tube and the air in it to cool, drawing a thread of mercury about 5mm long up into the tube. Allow all to
cool to room temperature. To move the thread of mercury further down the tube, to ensure it is not expelled when the tube is heated to 100&amp;deg;C during the
experiment, pass a short length of [[w:nylon|nylon]] fishing line (approx 0.5mm diameter)
down the tube and through the mercury. This allows the air below the
mercury to leak out around the line and when the mercury has fallen to the
required position, remove the nylon line. This should ONLY be done if one has proper safety training regarding the hazards of mercury and the school is equipped with proper mercury spill kits for containing and cleaning any potential spills.

      <comment>/* Declaring a subroutine */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==
Subroutines and functions are ways to break up your code into a reusable form. They allow the programmer to do a large set of operations just by calling the appropriate procedure or function. For example, lets say you need to PRINT a lot of lines, such as instructions. One way to do this is to just enter all your PRINT commands directly into where you need them. At some point, you may want to move the PRINT commands, or you may use the exact set of PRINTs elsewhere in the program. To move or change all of the PRINT commands would be quite a hassle. A simpler way would be to create a procedure and enter all of the PRINT commands there; then, when you need to execute the commands, you may simply call your procedure and it will execute each line in its body.

==Procedure vs. Function==
A procedure DOES something and does not return anything for the programmer. For example, a procedure might be used to set the screen mode and palette.

A function does something and RETURNS a value. For example, if you need to find the average of two values, you might write a function that takes in two numbers and returns the average. 

== GOTO and GOSUB ==

The GOTO and GOSUB statements were the original methods at which functions were created.  They were the most common on older basic implementations and are kept around for compatibility reasons; however, their use is not recommended in other programming languages or in large scale projects.

These two commands depend on labels, which come in one of two forms.  The first and older form involves writing line numbers at the beginning of each line (usually in increments of 10).  The newer method looks similar to other programming languages, which is a single word followed by a colon.

The GOTO statement is simple; it moves the execution point to a given label:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The GOSUB statement transfers control to a given label, and is paired with a corresponding RETURN statement.  

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== ON ERROR ==

The ON ERROR allows you to define an error handler for your program; when an error occurs, it immediately jumps to the given label.  The control returns once the program reaches a RESUME statement, which can either return control to the same point, the next statement, or any other desired label. 

Within Qbasic, the error handler cannot be located within any subroutines.  As such, any error checking or flags will have to be handled through the use of variables that are shared with the main module.

{{NOTE|While the QBasic documentation states ON ERROR RESUME NEXT is a valid statement, this is incorrect.}}

NOTE: If your error handling routine does not have a &quot;resume&quot; statement in it (IOW you try to do it all with gotos) error handeling will only work once - the next &quot;on error&quot; will be ignored and the program ends as if you had no &quot;on error&quot; statement at all. This problem does not seem to be mentioned in any of the documentation. It took me three hours to figure out why two nearly identical program portions acted so differently.

== Declaring a subroutine ==
A superior method of declaring a subroutine is using the SUB statement block.  Under the QBasic IDE, doing so moves the SUB block to it's own section in the window to prevent accidental deletion of the module, and allows the easier organization of the program code.

Calling a function is as simple as writing the name of the function (passing any required parameters.)   If you want, you can use the CALL statement to indicate to other programmers that it is a subroutine. 

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
SUB name (params)
{SHARED variables 'if any}
'{code to execute}
'  ...
'  ...
{STATIC variables 'if any, to be saved for use next time}
END SUB
&lt;/source&gt;

Parameters passed into subroutines are passed by 'reference' i.e. whilst they may take on a new name within the SUB any changes that are made to the values are 'reflected back' into the originals. All other variables used within the SUB are discarded when the END SUB is reached (or an EXIT SUB is executed), except as below :-

To 'preserve' the values of variables used within the SUB for re-use on the next CALL, use the STATIC keyword at the end. 

If you need access to a variable (that has not been passed as a parameter), use the SHARED keyword to define each at the start of the subroutine (a SHARED variable retains it's name).

== Declaring a function ==

A function is a form of subroutine that returns a value.  Everything that applies in defining a subroutine also applies to a function.  Within the function, the return value is created by using the function name as a variable - the return value is then passed to the calling expression. 

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
FUNCTION name (params) 
  ' Shared variable declarations
  name = result
  ' ...
END FUNCTION
&lt;/source&gt;

Functions are declared in the same way as variables - it returns the variable type it's defined to return, in the same way variables are defined to contain their specified type.  By default, it is a number, but appending a dollar sign indicates that it is returning a string.

Functions can only be called within an expression; unlike subroutines, they are not a standalone statement.

      <comment>/* Criticisms of ADDIE */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">--ADDIE is an instructional model for teaching the Instructional Design process.  The acronym corresponds with the five stages of instructional development: [[Instructional Technology/Analysis|analysis]], [[Instructional Technology/Design|design]], [[Instructional Technology/Development|development]], implementation, and evaluation. Each step of the model has an outcome that feeds information to the following steps.&lt;br&gt; 

*Assessment should occur at the beginning of a project.  During this stage, the instructional designer should consider optimals and actuals.  According to Allison Rossett, an expert on training needs assessment, actuals are what the current performance is and optimals are what should be happening, the desired performance. Once these are determined, it should be determined whether or not instruction is needed to fill the gap.  If instruction is needed, the instructional designer should continue the process.  If instruction is not needed, a Human Performance Technologist should be consulted.  &lt;br&gt; 

*Design happens after the assessment phase.  This is where the objectives, assessment approach, exercises and content is specified.[http://www.e-learningguru.com/articles/art2_1.htm]&lt;br&gt;

*Development is the phase in which the work takes place. User manuals/materials are created as well as instructor materials. The actual course is developed, whether it is an instructor led course, web-based course, or computer based training.&lt;br&gt;

*Implementation is the actual rollout of what was designed and developed. Providing the actual instruction/course to the learners.&lt;br&gt;

*Evaluation should be conducted throughout the phases in the form of formative evaluation. As formative evaluation is conducted, revisions are made to the instruction/design. Summative evaluation occurs at the end. Summative evaluation looks at the actual outcomes of the instruction, did the learners learn what they needed to know.&lt;br&gt;


== Advantages of Using ADDIE ==
Cost effective &lt;br&gt;
Saves time &lt;br&gt;
Promotes effective learning &lt;br&gt;
Consistent &lt;br&gt;
Effective in training &lt;br&gt;

== Criticisms of ADDIE ==

There are drawbacks to any large system or model and ADDIE is not different.  ADDIE has been criticized for being:&lt;br&gt;
Too systematic&lt;br&gt;
Too dogmatic&lt;br&gt;
Too linear&lt;br&gt;
Too constraining&lt;br&gt;
Too time-consuming to implement&lt;br&gt;--Nackj

== Introducing a Rapid Prototyping Phase in ADDIE ==
 
For best results, the development process for CD-ROM or Web-based training programs should use a modified ADDIE model, which borrows from the most valuable aspects of the systemic approach. Specifically, a rapid prototype phase is inserted after, or as an extension of, the design phase. A rapid prototype is simply a quickly assembled module that can be tested with the student audience early in the ISD process. The evaluation typically looks at things like how well the learners responded to the creative metaphor, how effective the learning activities are, and how well the program performs on the chosen technology platform. Based on the feedback, the design can be revised and another prototype developed. This iterative process continues until there is agreement and confidence in the prototype.

In this process, only after the prototype is completed is additional development work done. However, this work often moves more quickly after a rapid prototype than in the traditional ADDIE model. Instructional designers and writers are able to proceed more efficiently since they know exactly what the program will look like and what it will be capable of doing. Additionally, with all of the major technical issues resolved, final programming becomes a simple matter of assembly of media components.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fish sauce is made from fish, therefore not vegetarian. Does anyone have a veggie version of this?

:Other than being a bit salty, fish sauce is good for you. Fish contain omega-3 fatty acids. This isn't like eating a blackened hot dog.
::Other animal products are also good for you. The question, I think, still stands.
:::Mix vegetable broth with a touch of soy sauce. A vegetable broth/sake reduction would be good too.

: [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce (Vegan)]]. You could probably exchange it for soy sauce or some other savory sauce like that as well... wouldn't be the same, but it's a start. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:43, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

== What is a System ==

{{SideBox|Key words: &lt;br&gt;'''entities'''&lt;br&gt; '''connection'''}}

A system, S, is viewed as a whole made up of many parts or subsystems which are interconnected. To be considered as a system, S MUST have one or more objectives. In turn, each subsystem may itself be viewed as a system, leading to a hierarchy of systems (or subsystems).
The system's parts are working together as a whole to accomplish the system's objective(s) by performing certain tasks. Ex. a computer.

Keywords: system, subsystem, interconnection, objective

== Systems Approach ==

The systems approach developed out of the 1950s and 1960s focus on language laboratories, teaching machines, programmed instruction, multimedia presentations and the use of the computer in instruction. Most systems approaches are similar to computer flow charts with steps that the designer moves through during the development of instruction. Rooted in the military and business world, the systems approach involved setting goals and objectives, analyzing resources, devising a plan of action and continuous evaluation/modification of the program. (Saettler, 1990)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this catalogue the term &quot;stamp&quot; should be interpreted broadly to include, among other things,  any label designed and issued for use in payment of postal, revenue or related charges. 

Several present day postal administrations have sold their stamp issuing activities to agencies who have abused their right to design, print and distribute stamps.  It is not our role to pass judgement on these activities, but we need to make note of those judgements that have been made by others when we deal with these issues.

Other stamps were issued by governments in exile, pressure groups, political parties and organizations.  These stamps are often, but not always, propaganda labels that were never actually used to pay for postal charges.  It is important to document these and the numerous forgeries that have been produced over the years so that a collector who encounters this material will know exactly what he has.

      <comment>/* Annotation shorthand */ missing &quot;is&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Notating chess games is important to any chess student, since it allows them to review their strategy and that of their opponent, to read of classic chess encounters, and follow how the game developed. Further, chess puzzles are often set in magazines, newspapers and online, and their solutions are notated; for an example, see [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/chess/ The Times Chess].

== Algebraic notation ==

A very common nomenclature for chess games is [[Chess/Algebraic notation|algebraic notation]]. There are several older systems of notation, but these are less common. 

In algebraic notation, we use 
*'''R''' for a rook 
*'''N''' for a knight 
*'''B''' for a bishop 
*'''K''' for a king 
*'''Q''' for a queen 
*'''no letter''' for a pawn

Sometimes a pictorial language-independent notation is used, in which a picture of a horse might represent a knight, and so on.

Each square on the chess board is given by a co-ordinate, much like a map. The rows (in chess language, ranks) are labelled with Arabic numerals (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...), and the columns (in chess language, files) are labelled with letters of the English alphabet (i.e., a, b, c,...). A square's co-ordinate is first its column followed by its row. For example, in the board below, black's king is on the square '''d5'''.

If black moves his king to, say, '''d6''', the move is notated as '''Kd6''', i.e. the '''k'''ing has moved to square '''d6'''.

If more than one piece of the same type could have moved to the square to which the piece was moved, then the file of the piece prior to its move should come in between the piece's symbol and the coordinates of its destination (i.e., '''Qee7'''.)  If necessary, the rank it was on may also be added, (i.e., '''Qe6e4'''.)

{{Chess diagram|=

| The board's co-ordinates
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;

Moves in which a piece is captured, a king put in check, or checkmate have special notations. 

*If a piece is captured, a cross ('''x''') is inserted just before the destination square.  Thus, if the capture is done by a pawn, the cross is preceded by the column the pawn occupied prior to the capture.
*If the king is put in check, the move's notation is followed by a plus sign ('''+''').
*If the king is put in checkmate, the move's notation is followed by a hash or double plus signs ('''#''&quot;,'''++''',) or the word &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;checkmate.&quot;

===Annotation shorthand===

Annotation shorthand is not a notation system. Rather, it is a system of symbols for the author to add his descriptions or comments. An author notating a game might wish to highlight an excellent move, question a bad one, or indicate which player he thinks has the advantage. 

*If a move is followed by an exclamation mark ('''!'''), the author is surprised by the move's quality. 
*If a move is followed by a question mark ('''?'''), the author suspects the move may have been poor.
*If a move is followed by an exclamation mark and then a question mark ('''!?'''), the move interests the author, though it may be sub-optimal.
*If a move is followed by a question mark and then an exclamation mark ('''?!'''), the author fears that the move may be conclusive. 

Repeating a symbol (e.g. '''!!''' or '''??''') adds emphasis. 

Results are written as white's score followed by black's score. For example, '''1-0''' indicates that white won, and '''0-1''' indicates that black won. In the case of a draw, the result is '''½-½'''.

There are some additional symbols for the author to note his thoughts on the game in general, rather than on any particular move.
 
*An equals sign ('''=''') indicates positional equality between the players.
*A plus-minus sign ('''+/–''') indicates that white is considered to have the advantage. 
*A minus-plus sign ('''–/+''') indicates that black is considered to have the advantage.

== Ambiguity ==

Sometimes algebraic notation can be ambiguous - that is, two pieces of the same designation can move to one square. For example, a player might be able to move either of his rooks to the same square. In these cases, it is essential to specify which piece was moved.

The precise move is specified by designating the file (column) that the piece moved from, before the move's final co-ordinate. For example, '''Nd2''' indicates that a knight moved to '''d2''', but '''Nbd2''' indicates that the knight that was in column '''b''' moved to '''d2'''. If a piece's file is not enough to precisely specify the move, then its rank is used instead.  If neither is enough on its own, both are used.

=== Special moves ===

Some special moves are tricky to write in algebraic notation, and must have their own notation. 

*Castling king-side is written '''0-0'''.
*Castling queen-side is written '''0-0-0'''.
*En passant capture is written as if the captured pawn only moved one square. The notation may be followed with ''e.p.'' or ''ep'' to clarify that the capture was done en passant.
*If a pawn is promoted, the pawn's initial move is written, followed by an equal sign and then the shorthand for the new piece; for instance, e8=Q. Any additional nomenclature or annotation is written after the shorthand for the new piece (such as c8=Q+ if a pawn promoted to a queen on c8 and placed the opposing king in check.)

== Sample game in algebraic notation ==

If you have familiarized yourself with algebraic notation, consider this short sequence of moves. Try to follow the game by looking at the moves in algebraic notation, and the boards. 

The game has begun, and is nearing the end. White is to move.

{{Chess diagram|=
| tleft
| 
|= 
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=

 3 |  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| Sample Game
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;


White decides to move his bishop from  '''d3''' to '''c4''', to check black's king. This is white's thirtieth move. So in algebraic notation, we write

*'''30. Bc4+'''

Since only one bishop could move to '''c4''',  the bishop's initial position was not specified. The '''+''' indicates the check. 

{{Chess diagram|=
| tleft
| 
|= 
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 4 |  |  |bl|  |  |qd|  |  |=
 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| Sample Game
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;

White's bishop is now, unfortunately, in the queen's line of fire. Black decides to capture it. So for black's 30th move we write

*'''30... Qxc4'''

The ''x'' signifies that a piece has been captured. When black's move is written separately from white's, an ellipsis ('''...''') is placed between the number and the move. The ellipsis indicates that white's move has been omitted. 

The board now looks like this:

{{Chess diagram|=
| tleft
|

 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=

 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| Sample Game
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;

White is in trouble now, and decides to flee to '''f2'''. His move is

*'''31. Kf2'''

If black checks white's king, by moving his queen to '''c2''', his move is

*'''31... Qc2+'''

== Descriptive Notation ==

An older form of notation you will run into quite frequently is ''descriptive notation''.  It is useful to know because older books use it.  

In this form, instead of the files being a, b, c etc., they are Queen rook (QR), Queen Knight (QN), Queen Bishop (QB), Queen (Q), King (K), King Bishop (KB), King Knight (KN) and King Rook (KR).
The ranks are labelled from your point of view so that the square e4 (in algebraic) is White's K4 and Black's K5.

To record the moving of a piece, you write the piece, and to where it moves.  1. P-K4 means move a pawn to the 4th rank in the King's file.  N-QB3 means move your Knight to the third rank in the Queen's Bishop file.  For a capture, you specify the piece taking, and the piece to be taken.  QRPxN means pawn in the Queen Rook file takes Knight.  Excessive notation is left out so that if there is only one way a pawn could legally take a Knight, the move is recorded as PxN.  Note that if a piece is specified to be on the King's or Queen's side of the board, that is the side it is on now, not the side it started out on.

In order to compare the two systems, we could look at the same game in both algebraic and descriptive notation.

{|
! Algebraic !! Descriptive

# e4 e6                   
# d4 d5

|}

:1.{{Note|1}}Note here that since only one bishop can move to QN5, it is unnecessary to specify which bishop moved to that square.
:2.{{Note|2}}Check is indicated by &quot;ch&quot;.

== Coordinate Notation ==
A different type of notation uses only the squares that the pieces were on to denote movements. For example, to denote the earlier 7 moves, the following notes are shown:
#e2-e4 e7-e6
#d2-d4 d7-d5
#b1-c3 f8-b4
#f1-b5+ c8-d7
#b5xd7+ d8xd7
#g1-e2 d5xe4
#0-0

== ICCF numerical notation ==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;
{{ICCF chess|=
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 4 |  |  |  |  |  |qd|  |  |=
 3 |  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
| desc = Sample Game
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

A move is denoted by the file (1 to 8) and rank (1 to 8) of its starting square followed by its destination square (from 11 at the White queen’s rook square to 88 at the Black king’s rook square). &quot;1. e4&quot; is denoted as &quot;1. 5254&quot; in ICCF notation. Unlike other notations, ICCF notation does not make apparent when castling, check, checkmate, and capture took place (castling king side is 5171 for white and 5878 for black). Pawn promotion necessitates a fifth number specifying the new piece (1=queen, 2=rook, 3=bishop, 4=knight). This notation is considered to be international in that there is no dependency on piece names or specific alphabets. However this notation still depends on Arabic numerals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Guarding ==
When one of your pieces is placed so that it attacks a square occupied by another of your pieces, the former is said to be guarding the latter.
When your opponent captures the guarded piece, you can recapture with the guarding piece. Note that if you have a piece that is pinned to your king by an opposing piece (see below for a description of pins), it can only guard other pieces against capturing by the enemy king, but not from other enemy pieces, since it is unable to move or capture.

}}
Batteries are formed when two or more pieces work together. The most common kind of battery is the doubling of rooks on a file. Other batteries can be formed by rook-queen or bishop-queen.

A triple battery can be constructed with the queen and both rooks. This is known as [[Wikipedia:Alekhine's gun|Alekhine's gun]] (diagram at right) and can be extremely dangerous. It is often advantageous to place the queen behind one or both rooks as it is a more valuable piece.

== The Exchange ==
In almost any game, a player will have the opportunity to take one of his opponent's pieces in exchange for one of his own pieces.  This should however NOT be done for its own sake!  Initiate an exchange only when it benefits you.  Benefits can include, but are not limited to:

* Material advantage - Queen for a minor piece, queen for rook, rook for a minor piece, a piece for a pawn or two, etc.
* Doubling pawns - Take when taking back means the doubling (or tripling) of your opponent's pawns on the same file.
* Opening up the king's defenses - Take when taking back means moving a pawn that exposes the king.
* Removing a defender - Take when the piece being taken is providing an essential service for the opponent.
* Blunting an attack - When you are being attacked, often a well timed exchange will leave your opponent with too few pieces to keep up the attack.
* Gaining space - In a cramped position, having more pieces can actually be a disadvantage because the pieces get in the way of each other.  If your opponent has a space advantage, exchanging pieces can lessen the advantage and make the resultant position less confining.
* Improving a material advantage - if you are ahead material, exchanging pieces will usually benefit you (note - pieces, NOT pawns).  Similarly, if you have an extra pawn, trade pieces that may otherwise be used as a sacrifice to prevent pawn promotion.

| The Royal Fork
}}
Sometimes a piece can be in position to attack two enemy pieces at once. This is called a fork or a double attack. All pieces can fork, even pawns, but knights have a reputation for making especially vicious forks because they can jump over other pieces (and can attack another piece from a square that the enemy piece cannot attack, unless the enemy piece is another knight.)

=== Forking with check ===
A knight fork that attacks the king from an unguarded square is very powerful. The opponent must then move his king to safety and the other piece in the fork has no chance of escape.

==== The Royal Fork ====
A ''royal'' fork is one involving both your opponent's king and queen.  In the example shown here, white's knight on f7 has engaged black in a royal fork.  Black will be down the exchange of a queen for a knight.

| A Queen Fork - Black to Move
}}

=== Forks do not always win material ===
If every time you saw a fork you played it, you would be making a mistake.  You have to examine the different possibilities to escape the fork.  In the queen fork on the right white has just played 1.Qd4+ forking the black king and rook.  However black can play 1. ...Rg7 blocking the check and moving the rook to safety (although white could play 2.Qxg7, taking the rook, black could then play 2. ...Kxg7, taking the queen; white will then have lost the Exchange and will be unable to destroy Black's pawn majority, resulting in a forced win for Black, a queened pawn, and a king-queen checkmate.)

However 1.Qd4 is by no means a bad move.  Perhaps White played 1.Qd4 in order to force black to play 1. ...Rg7 in which White can now play 2.Qd8+ (fork on king and pawn) Rg8 (forced) followed by 3.Qxa5 in which case White can push his a-pawn.  Here White forked Black's king and rook not to win the rook but to later win a pawn by a fork, and pave the way for his a-pawn to become promoted to a queen.  He might have also intended to play 3.Qf6+ Rg7 (forced) 4.Qxc6, eliminating Black's passed pawn.

| The white knight pinned by the black bishop
}}
A pinned piece is a piece that cannot move because it would expose an attack on an important piece by one of the opposing pieces, such that the capture of the important piece would result in material gain by the opponent.  A very useful device is to pin the opponent's pieces to his king; this is known as an ''absolute pin''.  For example, imagine white's king on '''e1''', a white knight on '''c3''', and '''d2''' empty.  Black now moves his dark-squared bishop to '''b4'''.  The white knight is now pinned and cannot move, because moving the knight would put himself in check, which is not allowed, of course.  White's only way to stop the pin is to move his king.  A pawn on '''e4''' is no longer guarded by the knight, which could not capture a black piece taking this pawn.

| Attack the pinned piece, white to move
}}
In contrast to the absolute pin, a ''relative pin'' occurs when one player's piece is pinned to one of lesser value than the king, such as a queen or rook. If the benefit of moving the pinned piece outweighs the loss of material occasioned by the capture of the exposed piece (for example, if a forced mate may be achieved), then the pin can be disregarded and the pinned piece moved.

The position diagrammed to the right shows the theme of attacking the pinned piece.  In this position it is white to move.  The white player can look at this position and immediately take the rook and win an exchange.  However if he did this he would not be playing the best move.  If White did this then the material would be dead even; however, white has more pawn islands and it would be a very close game.  White can instead play Ng5!  The rook cannot move, and Black has no way of effectively defending the rook a second time in the next move, therefore in the end Black will lose a rook.  So, if you have pinned a piece, take a look to see if you can attack the piece again, and if a piece of yours is pinned, take a look to see if your opponent can attack it again. And above all else, if you see a good move, stop and look around for the best move.

A skewer is similar to a pin, but it is in a sense more powerful. The difference between a pin and skewer is the location of the more important piece.  In a pin the lesser piece blocks the attack on the more important one, in a skewer the more important piece is attacked first and when it moves it exposes the lesser piece behind it to be hit.  Black has, in a blunderous moment, placed his king on '''d7''' in front of his queen on '''d8'''. White may now triumphantly slide either rook to '''d1''', skewering Black's king and queen. Since Black cannot block the check, the king has to move, exposing the black queen to the attack of the white rook.

== Discoveries ==
A discovery is an attack on an enemy piece which is unveiled by moving one of your pieces. The power of discoveries is that two targets can be attacked simultaneously. If combined with a check they can be lethal.

Note that White's 1.Nd7+ was a ''double check'', a type of discovered check where the piece moving also gives check. Such checks are very powerful, since the king is forced to move (both checks cannot be blocked at the same time). They are also often lethal, as in the above game.

== Removing the defender ==
By first capturing, threatening, or pinning a piece that guards another, you might be able to capture the other piece for free. You can also remove the defender of a position. By using tactics you might be able to force a checkmate!

== Sacrifices ==
A sacrifice is an exchange of a piece for a non material advantage:

In the first diagram, White just moved '''1. Kh1''' to get out of check.

Black sacrifices his queen with '''1...Qg1+''' for a winning positional advantage - White is in check and can not take with his king because the knight guards the queen.

'''2. Rxg1''' - forced - this smothers the king - he cannot move because his own pieces are on every square he could go to - any check on an unguarded square now is mate.

'''2...Nf2#''' Checkmate. This queen's sacrifice was an example of a [[Wikipedia:Smothered mate|smothered mate]] (in which a knight delivers a checkmate that is caused by the king's inability to move anywhere).  In fact, this is a special kind of smothered mate, called ''Philidor's Legacy.''

A ''[[wikipedia:Zwischenzug|Zwischenzug]]'' (pronounced &quot;TSVISH-en-tsook&quot;,) or &quot;in-between move,&quot; is one that is made unexpectedly in the midst of a sequence of moves. But not just any series of moves, one in which the player falling for the Zwischenzug feels the sequence is forced, while his opponent demonstrates to him that it certainly isn't! Most commonly these fall in between trades where a recapture seems to be the only proper means of play.

Such in-between moves often have a surprising and pleasing effect of increasing the potency of a combination beyond the opponent's expectations.

Borisenkov-Mezenev (diagram, Black to play), went '''1... f2''', threatening to queen, which White countered with '''2. Rg8''', intending '''3. Rf8+''', and '''4. Rxf1'''. But White resigned after the Zwischenzug '''2... Bb1!''' which allows Black to queen ('''3. Kxb1 f1=Q+''' or '''3. Rf8+ Bf5''').{{-}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategy Basics ==
You may choose different strategies depending on what type of opponent you are playing, and what kind of player you are.   Strategy starts with the opening, and continues through the middlegame, and on to the endgame.

Games are considered open if the exchange of pieces have opened up files or diagonals, and closed if they have not. These games are called open or closed because there is more mobility for one’s pieces in open games, and usually determine the complexity of the game.  Specifically, recognition of open versus closed games is important because closed games are more conducive to Knights, whereas open games see more involvement with longer range pieces such as Bishops, Queens, and Rooks. 

Strategic Openings:
If you choose to play a long-range, theoretical sort of game, you may want to choose a complex opening such as the Queen’s Gambit, the Ruy Lopez, or the English.  In these types of games, especially when you are playing the closed variations, you are likely to venture into close positions where positional maneuvering predominates over tactical shots.  From there, you can focus on strategic elements like controlling files, pawn structure, and other long range development considerations.

Tactical Openings:
If you are more interested in sharpening your tactical play and focusing on combinations, you may choose a more tactical opening.  Some of these openings include the Sicilian Defence (especially the Dragon and the old main line of the Najdorf), the Grünfeld Defence, and the older variations of the Two Knights' Defence.

By initiating exchanges you can always simplify the game, and it will become more computational.  If you don’t want that to happen, you have to be very guarded and conservative.

You should always be thinking about how many squares a piece controls (i.e. can attack), and which squares are controlled.  In the beginning you should aim to control the center of the board.  As the game progresses you may want to attack one flank, especially if the King has castled onto that side.

== Material advantage ==
Having more valuable pieces on the board than your opponent means you have a material advantage.  If your position otherwise is equal, you will be more likely to win.  Since not all pieces are equal, many people use the following point system to estimate which player has a greater material advantage:

*Pawn = 1
*Knight = 3
*Bishop = 3
*Rook = 5
*Queen = 9
*King = infinite (3.5 as an attack/defense strength during end game)

However, a slightly more accurate system is as follows:

*Pawn = 1
*Knight = 3½
*Bishop = 3½
*Rook = 5
*Queen = 9
*King = infinite

These values can only be used as guidelines for the relative value of the pieces; a piece's value in a particular chess position must be treated on a case-by-case basis.

===Queenside vs Kingside===

When calculating the value of a position, dividing the board in Queenside and Kingside, it will be seen that it matters that the king is considered to be worth 3.5 points. The calculation of forces on either side will determine the stronger side. This side, usually can become the attacking one, all other things considered.{{ref|Yasser|1}}

=== The pieces' relative value changes over time ===

The value of the pieces changes as the game progresses, because there is less material on the board to get in the way of some pieces.  Rooks usually become more powerful because there are fewer pawns in the way, and a rook has the opportunity to control more squares.  Bishops can travel great distances if unobstructed, while knights have a more local presence. So, knights shine when the board is cluttered in a closed game because they can &quot;jump&quot; over pieces whereas bishops are generally stronger in open games where they have the run of the board.

=== The value of the King ===

Assigning a point value to the King for the sake of deciding to trade the King for other pieces doesn’t make sense, since capturing the King is the object of the entire game! Therefore it is customary to either exclude the King from the point value scale, or assign it an infinite value. However, keep in mind that the King has an attacking and defense capability as any other piece.

The King attack and defense value changes dramatically as the game progresses. During the opening and middle game the King is a piece that needs to be protected against checkmate at all cost. Its usefulness as an attacking or defending piece is thus limited. However its strength as an attacking piece becomes greater in the endgame. In this phase of the game it is generally reckoned to be stronger than a knight or bishop but weaker than a rook. Therefore giving the King an attack or defense point value of 3.5 during the endgame makes sense.

=== Knight vs Bishop ===

Based on the point value scale above the value of the knight and bishop appears to be the same. Alternative scales have tried to assign the knight and the bishop slightly different values, usually preferring the bishop over the knight. But since the relative value of the knight and bishop is strongly related to the position, such minor differentiation provide little overall guidance. 

Knights are more powerful if they have a safe outpost in enemy territory - a knight on the 6th rank that cannot be attacked by opposing pawns can be as powerful as a rook in the right circumstances.  This type of  knight, if guarded by a pawn, is called “a home away from home”.

A bishop never leaves its own color, so if one of the bishops is captured, half the board is now out of reach of a bishop.  So trading one bishop for a knight tends to favor the person losing the knight, who is left with two bishops. However, trading the second bishop isn't quite so hurtful. So trading a bishop for a bishop where one side has only 1 bishop to begin with helps the side with fewer bishops.

Knights cannot cover both sides of the board at the same time, while a bishop can, so in an endgame where there are pawns on both sides of the board, the bishop is stronger.

Bishops cannot attack pawns that are on the opposite color, while a knight can.  Furthermore, in a game where there is a short pawn chain, a knight can stand at the head of the chain and attack the pawn supporting it, so a knight is often more effective attacking pawns as long as they are limited to one side of the board.

Finally, it is possible to force checkmate with two bishops and king against a lone king, but not with two knights and king versus lone king.

It is important to keep in mind what sorts of positions will benefit the pieces that you have.  For example if you have 2 knights and no bishops and your opponent has 2 bishops and no knights then it would be good for you to keep the center cluttered with pawns by avoiding pawn exchanges.  If you do this then your opponent's bishops will have hampered mobility whereas your knights can hop over the pawns.  Also if you have the bishops and your opponent has knights then you should play to keep the center clear so your bishops can have more mobility.  Also, this idea can help you decide on whether or not to trade a bishop for a knight or vice versa.

=== More pieces are usually better ===

Usually having more pieces are more valuable when the point value is roughly equal for both players -- two bishops beats a rook, two rooks beat a queen -- but this is conditioned on proper co-ordination between the pieces. It may be worthwhile to sacrifice two pieces for a rook if this results in long-term damage to the enemy's piece co-ordination. Usually this means tying down the extra pieces to the defense of weak pawns, so that they cannot cooperate in attacking friendly pawns.

== Compensation ==

Material values only matter in the context of position. Compensation is a term used in chess to describe the trade off between material and positional advantage. A strong position can make up for a material deficiency. For example if your opponent has all their pawns on white squares, a black bishop is worth more than a white bishop.

Typically having compensation for a piece means that an attack against the enemy's king or strong points cannot be repelled or may only be repelled by the enemy returning the material he is up.  Often compensation can refer to having the initiative or in trapping the opponent's king in a vulnerable position.  A pawn majority on one wing or a passed pawn can also sometimes be considered compensation for a minor piece.  Generally the player who is down on material has to act quickly and avoid exchanging pieces to prevent the enemy from making his material advantage count.

== Pawn Strategy and Pawn Chains ==

{{main|Elements of chess strategy/Pawn structure}}

In the end game, pawns gain strength as they advance because they pose the threat of promotion, so a pawn on the 6th or 7th rank is worth significantly more than a pawn on the second rank - often as much as a piece.  However, in the opening and middlegame, an advanced pawn is less likely to queen and more likely to be in need of being defended.  It is also unable to defend the center and often leaves &quot;holes&quot; in your territory that can serve as outposts for your opponent's pieces.  An overadvanced pawn is then often a liability.

In the opening and middle game, pawns in the center of the board block paths and support outposts. So they tend to be more valuable than end pawns.  However, in the end game, a wing pawn is usually the hardest to get to and block or capture and is therefore more likely to queen.  So in the endgame, the edge pawns are often more valuable than the middle pawns (Note: this is not necessarily true in some basic pawn and king endings, where a pawn on the edge leads to only drawing options).

A passed pawn has only pieces stopping it from queening, so it is considered more valuable - especially if it is protected with other pawns.

== Tempo ==
Tempo is the effective number of moves required to reach the position on the board.  Moving a piece twice to reach a position it could have reached in one results in a net loss of one tempo - moving a piece back to its starting place usually results in a loss of all its tempo - unless other pieces moved that could not have moved otherwise.  Also the capture of a piece means all of the tempo it gained is lost as well.

Essentially, tempo is one way of showing how many effective moves you have made.  So the gain of a tempo is basically like getting a move for free.  Three tempi is usually considered equivalent to a pawn in terms of advantage.

Example:
{{Chess diagram|=

    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h

}}
&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
In the position above there have been 2 tempi played on each side, play continues with:

'''3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. e4 Nf6'''

{{Chess diagram|=
|tleft
|
|= 
 8 |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd|=
 7 |pd|pd|pd|  |pd|pd|pd|pd|=

    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
|
}}
&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
Now white still has 2 Tempi (one for d4 and 1 for e4) while black only has 1.  The captured pieces lost the tempo they had gained in moving and the knight lost the tempo it had when it captured.

For argument's sake, lets assume play went as follows:

'''5. e5 Nd5 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Qd3 Na4 8. Nc3 Nxc3 9. Qxc3 e6'''

{{Chess diagram|=
|tleft
|
|= 
 8 |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd|=
 7 |pd|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|=
 6 |  |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |=

 3 |  |  |ql|  |  |  |  |  |=

 1 |rl|  |bl|  |kl|  |nl|rl|=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
|
}}
&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
Now black still has only 1 tempo (e6) while white has 6 (2 queen moves, 3 pawn moves and a bishop move).  This has let white develop 2 pieces, control the center and give black a cramped position.  Also, while both sides can castle kingside in the same number of moves, White can connect his rooks (position them so there is nothing between them on the back rank) 2 moves sooner than black.  Chances are, white will complete development and launch an attack before black is able to.  This means white will have an advantage when the middlegame is reached.

== Quality ==


=== Active and passive pieces ===
An active piece is one that has the potential to make a threat.  A passive one is usually relegated to defending a piece (or worse - a pawn).

In this example, white's bishop on g5 is considered active, while black's bishop on e7 is considered passive.

Piece activity depends on whether it can move and attack.  A piece can be rendered passive if it is stuck protecting another piece or if it is restricted from being able to get into play by its own pawns. 

=== Good vs. Bad Bishops ===

{{main|Elements of chess strategy/Minor pieces#Good bishops vs. bad bishops}}

As noted above, a bishop can only travel on squares of one color.  This leads to a situation wherein one bishop may be effectively blocked out of the game by the pawn structure.  In general it is better to have your pawns on the opposite colored squares to your bishop.  
For example, if you as black have pawns on e6 and d5, your queen's bishop is likely to be a &quot;bad bishop.&quot;  It is bad because it is hard to do anything constructive with it; developing it to g4 is impossible and &quot;[[w: fianchetto|fianchetto]]ing&quot; it via b7 is ineffective since your pawn on d5 blocks any influence it may have over the centre. 
 
When one has a bad bishop there are two methods to improve the game: exchanging the offender and freeing up the game.  
In general it is profitable to try to exchange your bad bishop for an opponent's bishop or knight, as your bad bishop has little value. However, it is important to bear in mind that in the end game having two bishops is considerably stronger than have two knights or a bishop and a knight.  Therefore you should always be wary of exchanging bishop for knight in situations where an endgame is likely.
The other method to rid yourself of this weakness is by freeing up the game through making pawn moves.

=== Overloaded pieces ===
Overloaded pieces are pieces which defend too many other pieces and therefore cannot be considered to defend all of them at once. For example, a rook can defend up to 4 pieces, but if one is taken, and the rook takes the offending piece, 2 of the other pieces are undefended.

== Initiative ==

{{main|Elements of chess strategy/Development}}
{{main|Elements of chess strategy/The positions of the kings}}
The player with the initiative is the player who is making the threats to which the other person must respond.  Having the initiative is advantageous because it forces your opponent to place his pieces in essentially defensive formations.  A piece that is defending a square generally has less mobility (freedom of movement) than a piece attacking the same square.  

Having the first move, it is generally white who has the initiative in the early part of the game.  Therefore trying to maintain the initiative would be prudent strategy.



== Zugzwang ==
A [[w:Zugzwang|Zugzwang]] situation occurs when any move a player makes will weaken his/her position, but he/she is compelled to move in accordance with the rules. An example of zugzwang is as follows:

== Combining attack with defense ==

A winning strategy in Chess often involves balancing several considerations against each other. Moves that maximize immediate material gain might expose a vulnerability or yield a difficult position as the game progresses. Similarly, material sacrifices for position may be disadvantageous if they cannot be parlayed into an effective attack. Thus, a key consideration should be balancing attack with defense. A profitable move would be one that both furthers your attack and solidifies your defense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{details|Chess Opening Theory}}

The following is an overview of the aims of an opening and some standard openings that you can try in your games.  All of them are playable and should lead to reasonable games with best play.

== Aims of an opening ==

Before looking at some of the more common openings played today it is important to consider what you are trying to achieve in the opening of a chess game.  

In some cases, one player will sacrifice a pawn, or in some cases even more, to accomplish the goals listed below.  Such an opening is called a '''gambit'''.

'''Development'''

You should attempt to move your pieces away from their starting positions to squares in which they can participate more fully in the game.  Obviously a Knight at c3 is more effective both defensively and aggressively than a knight on b1.  Avoid moving pieces more than once in the opening as this allows your opponent time to develop another piece while you are wasting time.  Also avoid moving your queen in the opening, it can too easily be chased around the board by other pieces which aids your opponents development while wasting moves for you.

'''Control the Centre'''

The squares in the centre of the board are critical for two reasons. The first is that pieces in the centre are able to move to more squares than pieces on the edges.  (Note a knight on a3 can move to only 4 squares, whereas a knight on c3 can move to 8.)  Secondly, if you control the centre it is easier to move pieces from Kingside to Queenside quickly.  

One of the great truths in chess is that attacks along one wing are destined to fail if the centre is not sufficiently controlled.  This is because the defender with a strong centre will generally be able to muster enough defence on that side and at the same time mount a counterattack in the centre and/or on the other wing.  So if you plan on mounting an attack make sure you control the centre.

Traditionally it was thought that the ideal situation is one where you have a pawn majority in the centre, especially with pawns on d4 and e4 (for white).  However it has been shown that an equally valid strategy is to control the centre with pieces and make minimal pawn moves.  The thinking is that central pawn moves often lead to permanent positions and can block attacks.  &quot;Fianchettoing&quot; a bishop by moving it to b2 or g2 after b3 or g3 allows the bishop to keep a watchful eye on the centre without fixing a pawn in the centre.

'''Castle'''

A King in the centre of the board is open to attack.  It is generally a good idea to castle your king so as to be able to defend it more easily.  Some players will sacrifice material in order to prevent the enemy king from castling and to attack it ferociously due to its vulnerability.  Castling also has the added benefit of bringing the rooks together on the first rank so that they are able to combine in defence and attack.  Once your pieces are developed, king is safely castled, and your rooks are combined, the opening is over.

'''Protect the King'''

It is not always necessary although highly advisable to protect the king through castling. That being said, there are other ways to go about protecting the king than castling although they are less efficient and will often result in pins.

== '''King's Pawn Openings''' (open and semi-open games) ==

=== Ruy Lopez (aka Spanish Opening) ===
'''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5''' the main line continues '''3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0'''

The move '''3...a6''' works because if white plays '''4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5''', Black can regain the pawn with '''5...Qd4''' forking the e4 pawn and the knight.

There are two key replies: 3...Bc5, known as the Giuoco Piano (Italian for Quiet Game), and 3...Nf6 headed to a much more involved opening called the Two Knights Defence. 

School children in local clubs often drift into weaker variants of the Giuoco Piano, mostly out of insufficient knowledge. A few scholastic trainers have even suggested avoiding the opening, as there are fewer crisp strategic concepts compared to many other openings.

The Petrov Defence may look like a counter-attack, and very early on this was supposed to be the idea. However, it soon became apparent that the symmetrical nature of the opening produced defensive positions. If White takes the pawn, Black should avoid taking it back because of 4. Qe2 Nd6?? 5.Nc6+ which wins the black queen. The main line goes 3. Nxe5 d6  4. Nf3 Nxe4. It is considered quite solid, and is a key defensive opening against the dangerous first move 1. e4. There are a few gambits which White can try to shift the style of the opening. The Cochrane gambit is perhaps the most dangerous. It involves a Knight sacrifice on f7. Currently not considered objectively sound, its use is psychological: White dares the opponent to spend twenty moves defending against an attack, and this pressure may cause the Black player to finally fall victim to a tactical shot.

=== Philidor Defence ===
'''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6'''
{{Chess diagram small|=

If Black wants to defend the threatened pawn with a pawn, this is the way to do it (playing 2...f6? is plain bad, as 3. Nxe5 fxe5 4. Qh5+ is winning for White). It gives Black a solid but somewhat cramped position. The f8 bishop is hemmed in and will be relegated to a defensive role. The Black knight retains the option of going to d7 leaving the c-pawn mobile, but it is not without reason that 2...Nc6 is much more common than 2...d6.

=== Danish Gambit ===
'''1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2'''

This gambit gives White quick development and control of the center at the cost of two pawns initially. However, current opinion reports that to properly fend off the attacking waves, at least one and sometimes both pawns must be returned. This involves the liberating pawn push ...d5 by Black. Even so, inventive attacking players can still use the resulting open lines to play a complex game.

Play can continue

'''2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4''' (2...d6 and 2...e6 are also common, and usually also met by 3.d4)

The Sicilian is the most common and best-scoring response to 1.e4, as it balances the white advantage with flank play. It discourages White from occupying the centre with 2.d4. After 2...cxd4 White must either take the pawn back with the queen (and move it again after 3.Qxd4 Nc6) or sacrifice the pawn, usually with 3.c3.

One problem with the Sicilian is that there is a vast amount of theory written on it, and in a sharp opening like this, you can wind up in trouble if you don't know it.

White has three essential continuations: 
3.Nc3 &quot;Winawer Variation&quot;
3.Nd2 &quot;Tarrasch Variation&quot;
3.e5  &quot;Advance Variation&quot;. 

A fourth alternative, the &quot;Exchange Variation&quot; is 3. exd5, but this actually frees Black's game from all of the traditional cramping problems of the French Defence. It is mainly used by White players who forgo all attempts at a theoretical battle, hoping to play on &quot;general principles&quot;.

The French Defence is considered one of the strongest black responses to the White opening move 1.e4. Among world class grandmasters, it currently trails the Sicilian 1. e4 c5 and the symmetrical 1.e4 e5 in popularity.

This opening bears considerable similarities to another one called the King's Indian, which begins 1.(e4 d6) d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7. However, subtle but long range strategic differences exist between the two. In the Pirc, White's c-file pawn is still at home, and not committed to the c4 square. This means that overall, White has better control of the d4 square. The pawn move c2-c4 has been replaced by a developing piece move N-c3, and this &quot;faster&quot; development tends to encourage White towards central or kingside attacks compared with the queenside play classically associated with the King's Indian defence.

This move order is often used to &quot;back into&quot; a Pirc defence, while avoiding specific move order issues. However, an entirely different range of strategy is possible based upon ...c6 and ...d5.

This looks like a rather alarming opening for Black to play. Black lets White chase the knight around the board and use that time to build up the pawn centre. Black's plan is to show that White has expanded too quickly, and will find the pawn centre vulnerable. The disadvantage to this opening is that if White succeeds in maintaining it, White will have a serious and suffocating advantage in space.

Playing d7-d5 is the main idea behind most of the semi-open games for black.  Here it is played immediately for the price of an extra move with the queen after 3.Nc3.

Long disparaged as the epitome of weak play &quot;because moving the queen early wastes time&quot;, it was resurrected in the 1990s with a pawn move c7-c6, allowing the queen to retreat from a5 to c7 when necessary. Now it is considered an attempt to reduce White's central pressure, and is popular among club players because White suddenly has to demonstrate some sophistication.

This is a general continuation of the Scandinavian Defense. White developing its pieces towards the center by 4.d4 and 5.Nf3 placing the Knight on the natural f3 square. Meantime black develops also in a simple way 4...Nf6 and 5...Bg4 creating a pin for the white Knight. There is another pin for c3 Knight - created by the d4 pawn push. Now white has to eliminate the pins - in order to make the Knights free to move. White can do it by 6.h3 move or 6.Be2 - simple relieve for the Bishop pin. After 6.h3 black Bishop can retreat by 6...Bh5 - maintaining the pin or can capture the white Knight 6... Bxf3.

Black has gained a pawn but Black cannot keep it. If White wants it back White can play e2-e3 at some point, threatening the pawn with the bishop and if Black tries to defend it with ...b5 Black will find the queenside severely weakened (and the pawn should fall anyway). Nonetheless, this is playable for Black as well, instead of trying to keep the pawn, it is best to develop quickly and strike back at the White centre.

Popularised after World War II, the King's Indian Defence involves opposite sides strategies in a race between Black's mating attack vs. White's methodical attempts to unravel Black's Queenside. 

At World Class level, there is some concern that Black's concept is very committal, leading Former Champion Garry Kasparov to discontinue his use of the opening shortly before he retired from the game.  At any level below that, it is still very popular due to the deep developmental work by Fischer and Kasparov.

Looks a bit like a cross between the Queen's Gambit and the King's Indian Defence, but this opening is played differently from both of them. Black gives White an early opportunity to grab control of the centre with 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4. Black will need to launch a counterattack against that centre, perhaps with ...c5 to stop White from getting the upper hand. If Black succeeds, the White centre may indeed be very vulnerable, if Blacks fails, the centre will be very dominating.

After 3.Nc3, White threatens to take control over the centre by playing 4.e4. The Nimzo-Indian, named after the hypermodern player Aron Nimzowitch, is one of the two main ways of preventing this (the other way is the direct 3...d5 which leads to the Queen's Gambit Declined). Black puts a bishop where it pins the White knight, and often intends to trade it off, surrendering the bishop pair but inflicting White with doubled pawns if needed to recapture with the b-pawn. White can avoid these doubled pawns by playing the queen to c2, but this costs time. On the other hand, Black has not staked out a big claim of the centre yet, and White can get a real space advantage if Black is careless.

Strategically, this opening is similar to the Nimzo-Indian. White has played 3.Nf3 rather than 3.Nc3 so he is not threatening to grab the center with 4.e4 just yet. Playing the Nimzo-like 3...Bb4+ anyway is possible (and called the Bogo-Indian) and tends to lead to rather quiet play. More usual is 3...b6 which opens up for the bishop to go to b7 where it will continue the clamp-down on the e4-square, or to a6 where it will put pressure on White's pawn on c4.

It can be continued as the Fool's Mate: '''2.g4?? Qh4#'''.  Fortunately for White, the fool's mate is extremely rare, even among novices, because the Barnes Opening is passive and has no advantage over 1.f4, and because it is very easy for even a novice to see that the continuation of the Barnes Opening gives Black an immediate mate opportunity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Endgame is the last stage of chess, and arguably the most important. Even if you succeed in the opening and middle stages of the game, not knowing the skills to turn the resulting endgame into a checkmate can cost you many wins, turning many otherwise easily won positions into draws or even losses. For this reason, we recommend devoting a good portion of your study to endgames.

If you're still beginning your chess studies, the Basic Checkmates section should be enough to cover the simplest scenarios appropriate for your level. More complex situations are covered in the second part of this manual, suitable for those who already have a decent grasp of the easy checkmates.

==== Basic Checkmates ====
These include positions that have no pawns. When one side is ahead in material and has pawns, the easiest winning plan is typically to queen one or more pawns and use them to checkmate.

The situations where one has a king and queen, king and two rooks, or king and rook versus a lone king occur very often and it is essential to know how checkmate is achieved in such cases. The other cases, with minor pieces (bishops and knights) are more rare and more difficult to perform, but nonetheless are covered here for completeness.

When people think of hobbies, certain things come to mind, like stamp collecting, painting, or knitting. Few people, however, think of beekeeping. After all, who wants to be responsible for literally thousand of creepy, crawly, flying insects that are known to have the ability to sting? Well if you are reading this [[Main Page| Wiki book]], chances are you do.

Keeping bees, when properly done, can be a unique and highly rewarding pastime. Not only can beekeeping be entertaining and educational, when done on the correct scale it is also often a profitable hobby. Not only will your bees create honey and other products for you to harvest, but if you garden your fruit and vegetable harvest will also flourish.

'''Beekeeping, despite the many misconceptions, is a safe and easy hobby to start. It is a good hobby to start with family or friends.''' 

==Benefits of Beekeeping==
===Honey===
Man has been motivated to keep bees because of the reward of honey. Honey was the primary sweetener before store bought sugar was available to the masses, and honey is likely the main draw for many beekeepers. Large quantities of honey is produced by certain types of bees, called the honey bees; certain other types of bees such as the stingless bees (i.e. Melipona beecheii) produce moderate amounts of honey. Other types of bees such as bumblebees, and solitary bees do not produce honey.

As any beekeeper that has had at least one good harvest can tell you, there is no other honey that can even compare with that which comes from your own hive. Also, depending on the plants that are used by the bees, the honey you make can have its own distinct flavour. Since you are able to grow your own plants in the vicinity, or even move the hive to another location that has other plants, you can produce honey with different types of flavour.

Depending on location, weather and the experience of the individual beekeeper, it is not unheard of to harvest an excess of 100 pounds of pure honey. This means, for the more entrepreneurial-minded beekeeper, that there would be plenty of honey to sell. Depending on the market available per region this could mean a great deal of profit. In example, in the Midwestern United States honey sells for approximately four dollars a pound in bulk; this could mean as much as $400 gross revenue from a single healthy hive.

===Pollination===
Any gardener worth their weight in top soil knows the benefits of pollinating insects; having a large number in a central location is just that much more beneficial. A majority of plant survival is dependent on pollination, and bees do nearly eighty percent of all pollination, of which most of this occurs by solitary bees (not honey bees). Both honey bees and solitary bees can be kept by beekeepers, although most still focus primarily on keeping honey bees.
However, even in the event that honey bees are used, pollination is still aided and any increased pollination means larger harvests, and larger harvestable fruits and vegetables. By simply having bees one can expect their well-maintained garden to produce leaps and bounds over what it did before with poor or even barely adequate pollination.

===Improving Health===
Although no specific studies can be cited, many beekeepers claim that tending to their bees relieves stress. Some beekeepers even take a few afternoons during a good season to simply sit and watch the actions of their hives. Watching bees coming and going, with all their hustle and bustle, is quite the relaxing experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Chess, unlike many other games, does not involve direct chance such as the roll of a dice or which card is drawn. The outcome completely depends on the decisions of the players. However, because of its vast complexity, the far-reaching consequences of some decisions are practically unforeseeable.

One player (&quot;White&quot;) has the white pieces while the other (&quot;Black&quot;) has the black pieces. Sometimes the colors are not black and white (for instance, light and dark, or yellow and blue), but they generally contrast each other. In friendly games the choice of colors can be made by any method, such as flipping a coin. If there is no coin at hand, another typical way of deciding would be to conceal a black piece in one hand and a white piece in the other and ask one's opponent to select a hand. The colored piece selected will be the opponent's color. In competitive games the players are assigned their colors.

=== Order of play ===
Once all the pieces have been arranged, White (or the lighter color) makes the first move. White ''always'' makes the first move; this is important for notation, and any chess player will insist upon it. After White has made the move, Black will then make a move. The gameplay will continue in alternating fashion, White making a move, followed by Black.

===General movement rules===
*A move consists of moving a single piece, in accordance with its rules of movement, to a square that is unoccupied or occupied by an enemy piece. A player may never move a piece onto a square already occupied by another of his or her own pieces.
**''Exception'': There is a special move called &quot;castling&quot; where two pieces, a rook and the king, are moved; see below.
*If a piece is moved onto a square occupied by an enemy piece, the latter piece is removed from play and the first piece replaces it. The removed piece is said to have been ''captured'' or ''taken''. 
**''Exception'': In ''en passant'' capture, a pawn moves to an unoccupied square but still captures another pawn &quot;in passing&quot;; see below.
*Most pieces move and capture opponent pieces in the same way.
**''Exception'': The pawn has separate rules for moving and capturing opponent pieces.
*Most pieces may only make a move to a non-adjacent square if all the intervening squares are vacant (pieces may not 'jump over' other pieces).
**''Exception'': The knight can move to any suitable final square regardless of occupants of other squares.
**''Exception'': In castling, a king and a rook jump over each other.
*No player may make a move that leaves their king &quot;in check&quot; (see below).
*The player must ''always'' make a move when it is his or her turn. In other words, he or she cannot choose not to make a move. If no legal move is possible the game ends in a draw (see below), except when the king is in check - this is called ''checkmate'', and is usually how the opposing player wins.

Also, when a pawn moves to a square at the opposite end of the board, it becomes a different piece (pawn promotion); all of these exceptions are covered below in more detail.

==The board==
Traditionally, the game is played on a board of 64 alternating black and white squares turned with a white square to each player's near right-hand corner. &quot;White on right&quot; is a helpful saying to remember this convention. The light and dark squares on the chessboard and the light and dark chess pieces are traditionally referred to as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; respectively, although in modern chess sets almost any colors may be used (as long as they are not the ''same'' colors.) 

The horizontal rows of squares are called '''ranks''' and are numbered 1-8; the vertical columns of squares are called '''files''' and given the letters a-h. This way any single square can be easily identified by its rank and file, making it possible to record games by writing down the starting and ending position of the piece that moves every turn.

A chess diagram is always printed from the White player's perspective.

==The pieces==
The movement of the individual pieces is described below. In all the board diagrams shown, the squares to which the piece in question can move are indicated with x's.



===Pawn===
[[Image:Chess_pll44.png|left]]
Pawns can move one square straight forward, or optionally and on their first move only, two squares straight forward. The pawn is the only piece that can't move backwards.

==== Capturing Pieces ====

The pawn can move one square diagonally forward to capture a piece, but cannot capture a piece by moving straight forward. For this reason, two opposing pawns on a file may become blocked by each other. In the first diagram below, legal capture moves for the white pawn is indicated with black circles.

In the second diagram below the White pawn is prevented from moving forwards by the Black pawn immediately in front of it (in the d-file) which it cannot capture, but it can capture the adjacent Black pawn by moving diagonally forward as seen in the last diagram.

The pawn is the only piece that moves and captures differently.

===Knight===
[[Image:Chess_nll44.png|left]]
The knight has a unique L-shaped move; two squares in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and one square in another direction perpendicular to the first. The knight moves directly to the destination square, and may jump over any pieces blocking its way. The knight is the only piece that may always jump over or &quot;move between&quot; other pieces (another exception is the castling move). It is also the only piece that can't stop at the squares it moves over.

|Knight move - Jumping over pieces}}
{{-}}

The Knight is the chess piece with the most complex movement to understand. Thus there are many ways to look at and remember the Knight's movement:
* The knight moves in a L-pattern; two squares in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and one square in another direction perpendicular to the first.
* The knight moves in a L-pattern; one square in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and two squares in another direction perpendicular to the first.
* The knight moves in a Y-pattern; one square in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and one square diagonally in the same direction as the first move.
* The knight moves to the opposite corner of a 2x3 square rectangle one corner of which the knight is already on.
* The knight moves to the closest square to it not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.

===Bishop===
[[Image:Chess_bll44.png|left]]
The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. The bishop may not jump over any piece of either color. 

The bishop is restricted to the color of squares on which it began the game. Each player starts out with one light-square bishop that moves on the light colored squares, and one dark-square bishop that moves on the dark colored squares. In the diagram below, the bishop stands on a light square and can only move to other light squares.

==== Capturing Pieces ====
The bishop captures any opponent's piece that it encounters during the movement described above, and then occupies the captured piece's square. In the diagram above the bishop may take any of the black queens. Notice that bishop may not move (jump) to squares behind or capture pieces hiding behind the queens.

===Rook===
[[Image:Chess_rll44.png|left]]
The rook can be moved any number of squares horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Like the bishop, the rook cannot jump over any pieces, except for &quot;castling&quot;.

===Queen===
[[Image:Chess_qll44.png|left]]
The queen is the most powerful piece, being able to move any number of squares in any lateral or diagonal direction. It is best described as the combination of a rook's and bishop's movement capabilities.

==== Capturing Pieces ====
The king may capture any opponent's piece adjacent to it, as long as doing so does not place himself in check (see below). In the diagrams above the king may take any of the black knights.

==== Check ====

The king is the most important piece belonging to each player, though not the most powerful. If a player moves a piece such that he threatens to capture his opponent's king in the next move, that king is said to be in ''check''. 

If a player's king is in check, he must immediately remove the check by moving the king, blocking the check with another piece, or capturing the checking piece. 

In the diagram below black's rook has checked the white king. White may avoid the check by moving the king one step sideways, blocking the check by putting the rook between the attacking black rook and the white king, or capture the black rook using the white bishop. Other normally legal moves, like moving one of the pawns, are illegal in this position since they will not remove the check.   

In a friendly game a check is usually announced by saying ''check'' after the move is completed.

==== Checkmate ====

If the king is placed in check and can not escape, it is said to have been ''checkmated'' (or &quot;''mated''&quot; for short). The first player to checkmate the opponent's king wins the game. Note that the king is never actually captured, since it is obliged to move out of check whenever possible (and the game ends when it is impossible). In the diagram below white has no options to escape the check from black's rook, he is therefore checkmated.

{{-}}

====Special Restrictions — Avoiding &quot;Self-check&quot; ====

Players may not make any move which allows their king to be captured in the next move, i.e. places their own king in check. Thus two kings may never occupy adjacent squares, since they would have put themselves in check by moving there.  This is called the &quot;opposition&quot; and is indispensable when, for instance, you are using a queen or rook to checkmate a king.

The White king in the following diagram cannot move upwards or to the left since it would be in check from the bishop, or diagonally downwards which would leave it adjacent to the Black king. Also, as no piece is threatening it if it fails to move, the king is not currently in check. Similarly, the Black king cannot move diagonally upwards as that would put it next to the White king.

The diagram below shows a position where the white bishop's movement is restricted by the same rule; the bishop can not be moved since the move would let black capture the white king in his next move. The white king on the other hand may move to any of the adjacent squares.

==Special Moves==
====Pawn Promotion====
If a pawn makes it to one of the eight squares along the far edge of the board from their initial position, the pawn is &quot;promoted&quot;. Upon reaching the far rank the player exchanges the pawn with either a queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight. The player's move ends when the new piece occupies the promoted square.  

The new piece need not be a previously captured piece. Thus a player can have more than one queen, and more than two rooks, bishops or knights on the board. The player may never have more than one king, since the pawn can not be promoted to a king. In theory it is possible to get up to nine queens, or ten rooks, bishops or knights since there are eight pawns to promote. In practice however the pawn is usually promoted to a queen, since it is the most powerful piece, and it is rare for a player to have more than two queens on the board. If an extra queen is not at hand, a upside-down rook is usually used as a substitute.

====Castling====

[[Image:SCD_castle_kingside.png|frame|right|Kingside castling: O-O]]
[[Image:SCD_castle_queenside.png|frame|right|Queenside castling: O-O-O]]

Castling is a move involving the king and either of the rooks. Castling performed with the king's rook is called kingside castling, performed with the queen's rook is called queenside castling. A castling is typically done to move the king to a protective 'castle' surrounded by three pawns and a rook. 

Subject to restrictions detailed below, a player may move his king two squares towards the rook, and subsequently, ''on the same turn'', move the rook adjacent to but on the opposite side of the king, (onto the square over which the king has just passed).

The restrictions specific to castling are:

#Neither the king nor the participating rook may have moved previously in the game
#The king must not be in check at the start of the move, though it may have been in check previously in the game.
#The square over which the king passes must not be under attack ('in check') from an enemy piece.  (This would expose the king to a &quot;check&quot; in passing.)  The rook(s) may be under attack, or the queens' rooks may pass through an attacked queens' knight square.
#The king must not be in check at the end of the move. (Also applies to all normal moves.)
#The squares between the king and rook must be vacant.

The diagrams below shows example of positions where castling is not legal.

Note that the king must be the first piece moved and it must be moved two squares before it is released. If the rook is touched or moved first, then the king must stay where it is. This rule mainly applies in &quot;strict rules of chess&quot; where if a piece is touched, it must be moved. Touching the rook first indicates a rook only move, while releasing the king after one square indicates a king only move. Moving the king two squares is not a legal move by itself, and indicates a castling move.

====''En passant'' capture====
''En passant'' is French for &quot;in passing&quot;; you capture an enemy pawn as it is passing you.

When a pawn on its first move advances two squares onto the same rank as an opposing pawn on an adjacent file, this opposing pawn may, on that player's next move only, capture the advancing pawn as though it had only moved one square (provided the move is otherwise legal).  The pawn's ability to move two squares on their first move was a relatively late addition to the game of chess.  En Passant was introduced to prevent abuses of the new rule.

In the following example, the Black pawn advances two squares, and is captured by the White pawn which moves diagonally forwards and to the right (as if the Black pawn had moved only one square forward and been there). This move is only allowed on the turn in which the option is presented.

|Initial position}}

In the initial position each side has eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen and a king arranged as shown in the diagram below. Note that the only pieces on either side which can initially move are the pawns and knights.

Beginners often set up the board incorrectly; it is a complex position to remember. The following mnemonics may help you remember where the pieces go.

*'''White on the Right''' It is important that the bottom-right-hand square is light-colored.
*'''Knights live in castles''' One knight is placed next to each rook (rooks look like the towers of a castle, and are sometimes [incorrectly] even ''called'' castles.)
*'''Queens on their color''' OR '''The dress matches the shoes''' The White Queen goes on a White Square, Black Queen goes on a Black Square
*'''Bishops are advisers to the Royalty''' Bishops surround the King and Queen.
*'''White King on the Right''' From the White Player's perspective, both Kings are on the right, and from the Black Player's perspective, the Kings are on the left.

If the ranks and files are printed on the board, the following rules may be helpful:
* White's pieces should be placed on the 1st and 2nd rank, and Black's pieces should be placed on the 7th and 8th rank. 
* The Queens should be positioned on the d-file (''D for Dame''). 
{{-}}

==Conclusion of the game==
Play continues to alternate between White and Black until one of the following outcomes is reached:

===Winning and losing===
*One player's king is checkmated. The game is lost by that player.
*In a competitive game, one player runs out of time. The game is lost by that player (with two important exceptions, see draws below).
*One player resigns, which is equivalent to quitting the game. A player may resign on either his or his opponent's turn. Resignation is often symbolized by the resigning player tipping over his king.

===Draws===
*The player whose turn it is has been ''stalemated'', meaning that he has no legal move and is not in check.
*The players agree to draw the game. Either player may offer a draw to his opponent upon completion of his move. If the offer is accepted, the game is drawn. Draw offers cannot be rescinded.  However, they can be rejected, in which case the game must go on.
*A player successfully claims that the game is a draw under one of the following criteria:
**If the exact same position occurs or will occur three times with the same player to move, the player on move may claim a draw by threefold repetition. Note that the same set of moves must be available for each player (including castling and ''en passant'').
**50 moves have been played by each player, no pawn has moved, and no piece was captured.
**His opponent does not have sufficient material to checkmate him by any legal sequence of moves.
**Both players have run out of time in a competitive game.
**One player has run out of time in a competitive game, but his opponent does not have sufficient pieces to checkmate him by any legal sequence of moves.

{{-}}

The diagrams above shows example of some of the draw rules:
* Stalemate: Black is stalemated since he can not move his pawn or his king without placing himself in self-check.
* Same position three times: Black has checked white, and can continue to check white forever by moving the rook back and forth between f2 and f1. The same position will thus occur again and again. 
* 50 move rule: White has material advantage and enough material to mate, but if black plays correctly black will use his bishop to avoid being mated forever (and at least for 50 moves by each player).  
* Not sufficient material to mate: White has material advantage, but not sufficient material to mate.

==Chess Etiquette==
Generally, chess games at tournaments are conducted under the following rules:
*'''Touch move''' - If a player touches his own piece, he must move it, and if a player touches an opponents piece, he must capture it (unless the capture is not possible).  If he releases a piece on a square, the move is completed and can't be taken back. If you need to center a piece on its square, it is traditional to say ''j'adoube'' (I adjust).
*'''Be silent when your opponent is on the move''' - You can only adjust pieces, offer a draw, or claim a draw when it is your turn to move.

A friendly game may be played in any way that is mutually agreeable.  Generally it is considerate to avoid distracting your opponent.

==Glossary==
&lt;!--It's just a coincidence that these are in alphabetical order. If you would like to add terms, please put them in such an order so that it would make sense only by reading straight down with more basic series of terms at the top. Terms for which it is unnecessary to read other definitions, please place them at the bottom in alphabetical order.--&gt;
*'''Capture''' - To move one's piece into the same square as one of one's opponent's pieces.  The opponent's piece is removed from the board.
*'''Check''' - The king is 'in check' when it is being attacked by an enemy piece.
*'''Checkmate''' - The player whose turn it is can make no legal move to get his king out of check.
*'''Stalemate''' - The player whose turn it is can make no legal move, but the king is not in check.

Keep it and the language you use SIMPLE, as this meant to a beginner's book to learn Finnish. So avoid any linguistic terminology such as agglutinated form, because it could easily confuse the reader. If you need to give reader terminology, explain it. Also keep any Finnish in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; so that the reader can see that is Finnish. [[User:159753|159753]] 20:26, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Merger Proposal Rejected==

The reason is that the other two books, Suomen Kieli Ulkomaaliasille and Suomen Kieli Käyttöön are translations from the Finnish Wikibooks of the same names (the translations being at present in in English and Russian, although some pages are being developed first in English or Russian and will be moved into Finnish later. Because this is rather a complex process, the names of the pages and the books have been kept the same in the two versions making it easy to switch between the various language versions by changing the URL from fi.wikibooks... to en.wikibooks.. and ru.wikibooks.  It is therefore impractical to merge the books whilst this process is in development.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep bees wherever one lives. Because of this, if bees are still desired, solitary bees are an option. There exist solitary bees that are native to most regions of the world.
In this classification of bees, there is no [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee]], and therefore every female is fertile. There are no [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker]] bees for these species, as essentially laying females act as both a worker and queen in and of her self. Solitary bees typically don’t produce honey or beeswax on a harvestable scale.

Solitary bees are especially important as pollinators as many feral social bees are in danger, due to dwindling numbers and parasites.

==Bee Types==
===Mason Bees===
The term &quot;mason bee&quot; describes a solitary bee that lays their egg within a hole and separates that egg with mud, resin, leaf bits, pebbles, or chewed up vegetation/mud.  These solitary bees typically have life spans of about 6 weeks and are active only a part of the season.  The bees emerge from cocoons when the weather reaches a specific temperature keyed to that bee's instinctual requirements.

Mason bees will complete their life-cycle entirely on their own. However, most species of mason bees will nest close together, to increase breeding diversity and lower predation rates. This gregarious behavior of the bees makes it possible to keep mason bees in some capacity.

===Blue Orchard Bees===
&lt;small&gt;(Osmia)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The blue orchard bee, a spring mason bee, is opportunistic when it comes to its home and nesting site. Blue orchard bees lay their eggs in holes which they do not bore themselves. Rather they depend on preexisting holes to lay eggs. When preparing a nest site, the female bee will place a dab of mud at the end of the nest. The bee then begins to place up to twenty-thirty loads of nectar and pollen at the end of the tube. Once sufficient food has been collected, an egg is laid and she then seals that segment of the nest with a thin mud plug. This process is repeated for the length of the hole until she places an extra thick mud plug at the end to prevent pests from entering her nesting eggs.

Blue orchard bees are fantastic pollinators of early spring plants and fruit trees.  Blue orchard bees are high-speed flyers, and will pollinate many flowers in a short period of time. The bee’s high rate of activity, even during poorer weather, makes it an attractive pollinator for early crops. Much like honey bees, blue orchard bees will gather nectar in their honey sack as they forage. Any collected nectar is eaten directly by the foraging bee or saved as provisions for its nest. However, unlike honey bees, blue orchard bees do not have modified hind legs to store and carry pollen, rather pollen is collected within rows of stiff hairs that are located beneath the abdomen.  The pollen tends to fall off on every flower they touch.  As a result, they can pollinate about 2,000 flowers a day in comparison to the honey bee's 15 flowers a day.

The blue orchard bee may appear black in appearance, but is actually a dark metallic greenish blue color. Because these bees look strikingly similar to common flies, be sure to identify them before dismissing them. The female is about half an inch in length, the smaller male is more slender and of a stouter&lt;ref&gt;The word 'Stouter' refers more to width than length.  A better wording is needed here.&lt;/ref&gt; length. Males can be distinguished from females because of their long antennae and the existence of a light colored hair on the front of their head. 

There are two subspecies, ''Osmia lignaria propinqua'' (west of the Rockies) and ''Osmia lignaria lignaria'' (east of the Rockies).

===Hornfaced Bee===
''Osmia cornifrons''

Introduced to the US in 1984 as a gift from Japan.  Dr. Batra sent the cocoons of the Hornfaced Bee throughout the US.  This was before there were US restrictions on introducing invasive species.  As a result, the hornfaced bee, or the Japanese Orchard Bee (JOB's) are now a naturalized insect in the US.

There are many orchards using this pollinator, predominantly in the Wisconsin and NE states of the US.

It is extremely similar in characteristics to the Blue Orchard Bee, or BOB.

===Leaf Cutter Bees===
===Carpenter Bees===

==Attracting Solitary Bees==
===Plants===
Typically, most plants which are considered [[Beekeeping/Good Bee Plants| good]] for honeybees is considered proper for solitary bees. Most of these will be to late in the lifespan for masonbees, as they live only about one month as active pollinators. That is especially during early blooming fruit. Different species of mason bees will pollinate plants.  For example, the blue orchard bee exists only in the spring and pollinates fruit trees or virtually anything blooming at that period.  Other mason bees, like the leaf cutter bee which flies at 85 degrees pollinates plants later in the season like alfalfa.  Solitary bees often tend to start forage earlier in the morning (and earlier in the spring !!!), and thereby may pollinate some plants better. Some plants may be visited more often or more efficiently by differing types of bees, therefore a bee variety means better pollination.

===Building Solitary Bee Houses===
[[Image:Solitary bee house.jpg|thumb|right| Solitary Bee House]]
A solitary bee house for blue orchard or hornfaced bees can easily be built from scraps of non-treated wood (not cedar) by drilling a number of holes so as they don’t come though the other side. Bee houses for masonry bees can be made by drilling holes in bricks or can also be made by filling a wooden box (opened at the front) with paper straws.&lt;ref&gt;HDRA encyclopedia of organic gardening by Pauline Spears&lt;/ref&gt; A same design of house can also be made by using stems of certain plants (like Dipsacus spp, Phragmites ) but seem to attract only carpenter bees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativeplantwildlifegarden.com/how-to-build-simple-nest-boxes-with-native-plants-for-cavity-nesting-bees/ Phragmites and Dipsacus used for carpenter bee houses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the holes is what the solitary bees will make their nests in. Each individual hole is a separate nest for each individual female bee.

*Blue orchard bees seem to prefer &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; in (8mm) in diameter holes. Holes should be drilled between 3 to 10 inches (7—25cm) deep for best results. The deeper the holes, the more females may be created.
*'''Caution''': these drilled holes are easy to build, but actually are bad for the solitary bee.  Pests (pollen mites, chalkbrood, etc.) also increase which results in the entire hole not opening up after a second season of use.  The uninformed gardener sees a mudded-over entrance and assumes their solitary bees are fine.  In reality, these holes over 2-3 years tend to not open up and are instead, mason bee cemeteries.  Using paper straws, reeds, or wood trays are already better for producing more solitary bees.  Placing straw inserts into the drilled holes is an option, but at times the pollen within the hole is so wet, it cements the insert to the wood... again making the hole useless.  Using plastic straws traps the moisture within the straw resulting in moldy cocoons. Basically one must know that any kind of artificial nesting device must be really weathered before bees are going to accept it. Whatever the material is, factory smells and tastes must be gone before using.
*Other non-specific holes may attract solitary wasps.  Smaller 1/8&quot; holes attrack aphid wasps which help the gardener reduce aphids without using chemicals or pesticides.
*Put houses facing south to southeast to allow morning light to warm the houses and encourage foraging.  Placing the house under an overhang helps the holes stay dry.  A height of 5-7 feet (2m) above ground is preferred so that the gardener can watch the activity.  Any height is fine, but on the ground increases the likelihood of rodent interference.

In Belgium, modular ceramic and rubber breeding systems are developed by the founder of these, Leo Aerts. Easy to maintain and very sustainable. Also suggested to use with BEE-O-Smell (Olfactorius) for starting populations. The properties of ceramic and rubber makes it possible to focus even on ground-nesting bees as Andrena and some Colletes, which are both also excellent pollinators. Especially usefull in hillside cultures of any fruit or veggies. Modules can easy withstand being half digged in. Experiments are running.

===Buying Bees===
Some solitary bees (Blue Orchard and Japanese Hornfaced) may be purchased locally at some garden centers or nurseries. If they can’t be found locally, they can also be found from online retailers and mail order catalogs. When purchasing mason bees through the mail they may arrive as cocoons within a cardboard tube.  If purchased in February or later, ensure they are transported with cooling packs as you don't want your bees emerging mid-transit.  The cocoons should be kept in your crisper drawer in the refrigerator until the outside weather is about 55 degrees F (12 degrees Celsius) and pollen is available.

[[Image:Habanero.jpg|thumb|right|Habanero]]
A '''habanero''' (not habañero) is an unbelievably hot [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], often rated between 200,000 to 300,000 Scoville heat units. Although not eaten by most, there is a niche for habaneros from some of those who like hot food. Merely touching them can cause a strong burning sensation. Brushing contaminated hands on any other body part, particularly the face and genitals, can lead to excruciating pain. Particular caution should be made when dropping habaneros in to hot oil, as the steam that rises will cause irritation if it hits the eyes or other membranes.  

Habaneros, besides their intense heat, are known for their delicate almost citrus like flavor. Many connoisseurs of hot foods prefer to select smaller, more wrinkled habaneros, as those are the ones with the most intense heat and best flavor. People who are less bold, but still enjoy spicy foods, can carefully remove the ribs and seeds of the pepper and eat the remaining flesh.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I removed the statement that “almost nobody eats habaneros” Where as it may be more so rare than other foods, it is available in many super markets especially in New Mexico, Texas and Colorado. It is defiantly available for those who want it, and I’m sure availability would not be so pronounced id nobody ate them.&lt;br&gt;-[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 04:30, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)

:Availability is partly because habaneros keep well. They can sit in the store for a long time. They don't take up much space. They command a fairly high price. A bit of litigation could put a stop to this. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:It needs to be made ''really'' clear that this is not like a jalapeño. Most people find the jalapeño to be intolerably hot. The bit about &quot;delicate almost citrus like flavor&quot; is pretty funny. I can't imagine that anyone would be able to notice. Peppers are used in hot-weather cuisines (Central America, SE Asia, Africa, India...) to hide the taste of spoiled food. Aside from the hotness, any flavor from yeast-like to banana-like would not be distinguishable. After eating the habanero, corn tastes like beef tastes like mint tastes like french fries... [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Admittedly they can be quite hot, and I would not recommend anyone eat them unless they have some extreme intestinal fortitude, or have a good deal of experience with spicy food. I personally did not start eating them until about 2 or so years ago, and now I can’t imagine going on without them. They however do not seem to keep well at all, I’m lucky to find one in good shape at the grocery store, and even then I often can’t keep them from getting moldy or breaking down for more than a few days. This year I’ve decided to actually plant a few in the garden, I’ll be able to see how they properly last, and I’ll be sure to notify everyone around here about my findings.

      <comment>/* How the Model Works */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bell jar lungs.png|right|thumb|Bell jar model lung]]

This simple '''Bell jar model lung''' can be used to demonstrate the basic principles of [[w:breathing|breathing]]. The model should be assembled as in the diagram. A swimming cap makes a suitable [[w:diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The cap can be attached to the bottom of the bell jar, and the [[w:balloon|balloon]]s can be attached to the Y shaped tube, with [[w:elastic band|elastic band]]s or plastic coated wire.

===How the Model Works===

The cavity inside the bell jar is airtight
*As the diaphragm is pulled down, the [[w:volume|volume]] of the cavity increases. This causes the [[w:pressure|pressure]] to fall. [[w:Air|Air]] rushes in to equalise the pressure causing the balloons to inflate.
*As the diaphragm is pushed up, the volume of the cavity decreases, the pressure rises, and the air rushes out of the balloons causing them to deflate.
*This is a great project for classes studying health or for those students learning fluids in science.
The bell jar model helps children from all ages

===More Advanced Models===

To more accurately render the anatomical and physiological properties of the lung, where the intrapleural space is filled with aqueous fluid you might want to replace the air in the bell jar with water. By filling the intrapleural space with water the model becomes a little bit more responsive, because of the incompressibility of water in contrast to air. Additionally preloading the balloons by removing water also better assures their automatic return to the exhaled position. A good introduction and overview is given by an article by T. Sherman in Advances in Physiological Education. &lt;ref&gt;'''Sherman, T. F.''' A Simple Analogue of Lung Mechanics. Am. J. Physiol. 265 (Adv. Phyaiol. Educ. 10): S32-S34, 1993.  http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/265/6/S32?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;author1=Sherman%2C+T&amp;fulltext=bell+jar+lung&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bienenkoenigin.JPG|thumb|right|A marked queen bee]]
Queen bees begin the same as any other fertilized bee egg. The main difference is their rich diet of [[Beekeeping/Royal Jelly| royal jelly]] and an extended sized cell. In each colony, there normally only exists a single mated adult queen, however it is not unheard of to have a mother and daughter queen function in the same hive at the same time. There have even been recorded examples of grandmother, mother and daughter queens working in the same hive, however it is not possible to have sister queen working at the same time. In most cases, because she is the only mated bee in a [[Beekeeping/Queen Right|queenright]] hive, the queen is either the mother or sister of all bees within a hive.

==Appearance==
The queen is the largest bee within a colony. She is considered by some to have an almost wasp like form, but obviously closely resembles the form of a bee. The queen will have a longer body than any other bee within the colony, it will seem almost as if her wings are simply too short. If you are lucky the queen will be [[Beekeeping/Marking The Queen| marked]] and will easily stand out as compared to the rest of the bees. Depending on [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| race]] the queen may be lighter or darker than the other bees.

==Behavior==
===The Queen's Court===
The queen bee is wholly unable to care for herself, because of this she is often surrounded by a ring of attendant bees that follow her, feed her, groom her and carry away her waste.

===Aggressiveness===
The queen bee does have a stinger, and unlike that of a [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker bee]] it is not barbed, and may thereby be extracted after a sting without killing her. This means that a queen is capable of stinging multiple times, however it is extremely rare for a queen to sting a beekeeper, even if being treated roughly. The queen's sting is most often reserved for dispatching other queens within the hive.

==From Egg to Bee==
Queens develops more fully than their sexually immature hive mate [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| workers]] because of her vitamin and mineral rich [[Beekeeping/Royal Jelly| royal jelly]] diet. The queen [[Beekeeping/Brood| Brood]] must also be raised in a larger specially constructed queen cell. 
===Queen Cell===
[[Image:Queencell_0017.JPG|thumb|right|Queen cells]]
Queen cells, unlike normal brood cells, are built vertically instead of horizontally. This special queen cell is often referred to as a peanut or peanut cell. There exist three main distinctions regarding queen cells and their specific purposes. 
;Swarm cells :Swarm cells are created near the bottom of the comb during a time when a [[Beekeeping/Swarm| swarm]] is likely. The new queen often stays behind with the old queen leaving with the swarm.
;Supersedure cell :Supersedure cells are created mid-level on the comb, there is likely always a few in existence. Any queen that hatches from a supersedure cell will likely replace the active queen.
;Replacement cell :Replacement cells are built in case of emergency to replace a missing queen.
===Larva===
Once the queen to be has hatched from her egg, workers cap the cell enclosing her. In some case where the queen is lost, even after the larva within has hatched, a normal cell may be converted into a queen cell and the larva can be coaxed into becoming a queen.

===Emergence===
As young queens begin to emerge from their cell, they often begin to emit a high-pitched perching sound called a pipe. This signal is thought to be a notification of hatching to challenge other emerging or existing queens. Emerged un-mated queens in most cases will quickly find and kill their developing queen sisters. 

==Duties==
===Mating===
Within a week or two after hatching, on a clear warm day, a new queen will take part in a nuptial flight in order to mate with several [[Beekeeping/Drone Bee| drones]]. This virgin queen will only have a short window where successful mating may take place. If unable to mate due to bad weather, or other consequences, the queen will become what is considered a drone layer. In nature a queen that solely lays drones means certain death for the colony, as there will exist no fertilized eggs from which a replacement queen may be raised.  Because the queen is able to store the sperm from the drones she mated with, the queen should be able to lay fertilized eggs for her 2-3 year life span. After mating, the queen will not leave the hive, with the possible exception of joining a [[Beekeeping/Swarm| swarm]].

===Egg Laying===
Once mated it is the queen’s primary function to act as sole extender of her line of genetics. In essence the queens bee’s purpose is to constantly lay eggs. A healthy queen which was well cared for and a proper mating, may lay up to 1,500 eggs per day during peak times of the spring build-up, as quick as a new egg in a thirty second interval. During a time of prosperity the queen may lay several times her own weight in eggs every day.

===Queen Substance===
The queen is also responsible for producing a pheromone commonly referred to as the queen substance. This pheromone alerts the entire hive to the queen’s well being, if absent, even if just for a few hours, the entire colony is notified and work is begun creating a new queen.

==Life Cycle==
;Day 0 :A fertilized egg is laid by the reigning queen.
;Day 3 :The fertilized egg hatches.
;Day 9 :The queen’s cell is capped.
;Day 16  :The new queen emerges from her cell.
;Days 19-21 :The queen’s orientation Flight takes place.
;Days 23-26 :The queen takes her nuptial Flights
;Days 26-30 :The queen begins to lay eggs.
*It is possible for a queen to live for up to 5 years, however she is often replaced within 2.

==Quick Facts==
*The queen bee, though always considered a monarch, was once considered to be a king bee.
*Despite her royal title, the queen bee has little to no say to what goes on within a hive. This task is up to the [[Beekeeping: Worker Bee| workers]].

Hi Karl

You best speak to [[User:Marknewlyn|Mark Newlyn]] about this, FHSST is his project, see: [http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/index.html]
I was contracted to upload the physics textbook up to wikibooks once it was deemed to be ready. Two other textbooks are on their way, one for Chemistry and one for Mathematics. 

As you can see from the [[FHSST_Physics|FHSST Physics]], not everything is there yet, and I am sure there are many formatting issues that can be improved :) Any help with that would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks, --[[User:Riaan|Riaan]] 09:01, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Thank you and 1 suggestion ==

THank you for your contributions to this physics education guide. May I suggest that in addition to the images that you add to the wiki you also add their respective sources especially if they (as I hope) happen to be made with a free software. This would allow other people like me to reuse some of the images, for example to translate them to French. Regards, Nicolas ( npettiaux on fr.wikipedia.org)

==Releasing a first PDF edition of Physics? ==

I have recently proposed that some Wikibooks are ready for a first PDF edition. Physics is a likely candidate.  The first edition would contain a prominent link saying &quot;If you wish to edit, correct or contribute to this book please click here&quot;. The idea is to use some of the better and more complete books as an example. What do you think? See:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Breeding [[w:Siamese Fighting Fish|Siamese Fighting Fish]]

The system of betta fish is based upon aggression &amp;  territoriality. There can be serious consequences with fighting between fish, especially if the defeated contender cannot get out of the reach of the victor of the battle. They have been bred to be more aggressive to one another, literally down to the teeth. Even if the loser can escape the victor, both fish have inflicted wounds upon one another that can lead the way for potentially fatal infection.
== Simple Method == 

===Method Notes===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is 
 the most efficient way as you gain more experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Breeding Notes===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all males build a nest before trying to mate. Some do it as they are mating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A majority of females do not care for the above types of males.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out the female after they have finished spawning, or when the male is constantly chasing the female and she appears very tired (Some chasing is common before breeding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Breeding Requirements===
[[Image:IMG_5515.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fish Tanks]]


The basic equipment list needed includes:

#5-10 gallon aquarium without sand or gravel
#Soft fish net to fish out your breeder bettas when the time comes
#[[w:Styrofoam|Styrofoam]] cup cut in half to contain the bubble nest 
#Thermometer - to monitor your tank's temperature
#2 floating plastic plants or other hiding places- to provide protective hiding place for unready female and fry
#Either Plexiglass, Glass, hood or light - must cover the entire tank...those that do not should be covered with [[w:saran wrap|saran wrap]]. This traps in moist humid air which helps fry's labyrinth develop correctly. 
#Aquarium Heater - should be fully submersible including cord. 25W would be adequate. 
#1 oz of brine shrimp eggs so you can hatch then and feed your fry as they grow
#Microworm culture - from breeder
#1 Siphon hose to clean your fry tank and vacuum uneaten foods before they rot and cause bacterial outbreaks, which might kill fry. Note: when using siphon hose, use care not to vacuum out fry.
#Water conditioner 
Methylene Blue (to protect torn fins from getting infected) [[w:spawning|spawning]]
Maroxy (to prevent fungus from attacking eggs)
Aquarium Salt (to prevent velvet disease)
Treat with medicine to cure, not prevent. Bettas internal organs can be damaged by harsh medicine.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Tank Dimensions:''' Height 14cm. Width 13cm. Length 22cm.&lt;br&gt;
Smaller tanks technically could work but, you run the risk of disturbing the nest(empty or otherwise) when adding or removing the female. You may damage the nest either by touching it, causing ripples on the water, or by the wind caused by the movement of your hands(less likely but possible).

A bigger tank also means a bigger nest.  It should be noted however that the bigger tank has more fry inside.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Foilage:''' Plants with lots of leaves or branches.&lt;br&gt;
This is so that the female can run and hide from the male. When she is ready she will not run and hide so no worries there. This will also allow the growth of foods that are small enough for the betta fries to consume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Food:''' Microscopic '''

''' food for babies and high protein foods for breeding parents.&lt;br&gt;
 For the adults, foods like bloodworms, tubifex worms, brine shrimp (frozen, dried, live). You should feed the parents rich foods 1-2 weeks before breeding (Part of conditioning). For fry infusoria, microworms and baby brine shrimp.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Aeration:''' A small corner or sponge filter,barely bubbling.
These bettas need calm waters else the nest will break. Later on though, the fry will need to have VERY LIGHT aeration in their tank. This is to help in breaking the surface of the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Temperature:''' Tropical water temperatures. 78-84F
People in non tropical climates may need a heater. People who live in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand probably won't need a heater. If you're not living in South-East Asia, you may also want to put a tight fitting cover on top of the tank to maintain the humidity and warmth that the betta fry need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Water:''' Treated tap water,add aquarium salt,and the correct dose of Maroxy.
&lt;/ul&gt;

'''''Summary:''''' Bare tank + plants + warm temperature + water + (later on)microfoods
&lt;p&gt;

===Conditioning===
For a start, you will get better results by getting the pair into a condition good for breeding. You can feed the adult pair high protein foods like Bloodworms, Tubifex worms, small insects, (Adult)Brine Shrimp (Frozen/Dried/Live), etc...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

===Tank Setup=== 
Put plants in the tank in such a way that the fish can swim around it and chase each other without catching each other too easily. These plants will also later serve as a food source for the baby bettas who will eat microscopic organisms off of it. The growth of these organisms can be stimulated also by dropping a few drops of LiquiFry No. 1 in to the tank. The LiquiFry itself also consists of tiny food particles that the fry can eat. Baby brine shrimp(BBS) are also good.

===Breeding===
You know the female is ready for breeding when you can see just behind the ventral fin, a white egg tube sticking out. That is an ovipositor, through which she will release eggs. This does not mean that she is ready for mating with THAT male though. It just means she's ready for breeding.

The male is almost always ready for breeding. You may see him flaring and chasing after the female. This is normal. He most probably may have also already built his nest. If you are the cautious type and are waiting for the nest to be ready before you introduce the female, do so now.

The female, may occasionally destroy the male's nest if she feels it is unsatisfactory. If she does this, remove her and let the male rebuild the nest again. Reintroduce her after he has finished building his nest. If after reintroducing her again, she still destroys his nest, you may wish to get another female, or another male.
&lt;/p&gt;

===Mating===
When the female has chosen a male she will maneuver her body so that her head is facing downwards. Depending on her colors you may also see vertical stripes on her body. The female will also occasionally chase the male.

After some more chasing the male will eventually capture the female and wrap his body around hers and fertilize her eggs.

He will recover quickly and catch the eggs and put them in his nest. The female will stay motionless for a while longer. She occasionally will help by putting the eggs in the nest. DO NOT be fooled -- at times she may be eating them instead.

Note: Sometimes the male may be inexperienced and will not embrace the female properly. She will drop out of his grasp and leave him floating in a trance-like state. Do not bother them though. If mating has not occurred after 2 days you should remove the female to let her rest. 
&lt;br&gt;

===Feeding Fry===
Fry need very small, live foods. Infusoria is the best and is good for the first week of the frys life, to prepare a culture put some lettuce in a bottle of treated water, add a couple of drops of LiquiFry #1. Leave it in bright light. Within 3 weeks millions of infusorians will be ready to feed. Feed only a few drops often to keep the tank clean.
Hatching Brine Shrimp, you will need 1 bottle, airline tubing, rock salt, and brine shrimp eggs. Fill the bottle with treated tap water, a rock salt and brine shrimp eggs.Put in your airline tubing, and make your air flow very powerful. After 20 minutes stop the airflow. When your eggs hatch the shrimp will go to the bottom. Suck them out with a turkey baster.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

===Keeping the fry clean===
Fry need to be kept in clean water or you may end up looking for [http://bettafishcare.us/sick-betta-fish sick betta fish help], so daily water changes are a must. A 50% water change daily is fine as long as the water being replaced is the same temperature as the original and the pH is the same.Make sure your not getting any fry.

===Growout Tanks===
At 3 weeks of age the fry are ready to be moved to a larger tank. The larger tank should be 20+ gallons. When moving the fry be sure to make the temperature the same and the pH the same. Do weekly water changes in the larger tank.This is not needed with a smaller spawn.

===Jars===
At around 8 weeks the males will show finnage and become increasingly aggressive. You should remove them and place them in individual jars. Keep the jars clean and feed the young bettas frozen foods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== NES Programming Tutorial 1: Welcome to the machine ==

The recommended language for programming the NES is assembler, because the slow 8-bit processor demands it. The processor is similar to the early Intel chips, but lacks certain functions.

The 6502 processor can address up to 64 kilobytes of memory. Think of this as a continous space that has 65536 &quot;cells&quot;. Each &quot;cell&quot;, or byte, can store a number from 0 to 255. The first 256 bytes of this space is known as the zero page, which the 6502 can access about 2 times faster. The next 256 bytes are the [[:w:Stack (computing)|stack]]. The 6502 contains 3 general-purpose registers:

'''A'''ccumulator - all data movement, mathematical, and logical operations go through here.

'''X''' index register - used for general counting and pre-index memory offsetting.

'''Y''' index register - used for general counting and post-index memory offsetting.

All of these general-purpose registers can be used for any reason, but the reasons above are what they are ''usually'' used for.

These are special-feature registers.

'''S'''tack pointer - keeps track of the stack.

'''P'''rocessor status - keeps the result of previous instructions.

'''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter - keeps track of where the program is executing.


There are several ways to access memory:


*Immediate

Here, the exact value of the 8-bit number is written in the instruction. No memory accessing occurs. To denote an immediate, place a # before the number, for example

&lt;tt&gt;LDA #15 ; load the number 15 into the accumulator.&lt;/tt&gt;


*Absolute Addressing

The 16-bit address is stored in the instruction. Whatever at the specified memory address will be the number. For example,

&lt;tt&gt;LDA #196 ; load the number 196 into the accumulator.&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;STA 2001 ; store the accumulator at memory location 2001.&lt;/tt&gt; 


*Zero Page Addressing

Similar to absolute addressing, this method accesses an absolute address. However, this method saves a byte by only writing the low byte in the instruction. The high byte is assumed to be zero. Therefore, this method can only be used for the zero page. The following example shows the same instruction using absolute and zero page addressing.

&lt;tt&gt;LDA $00F8 ; Absolute, works but wastes space&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;LDA $F8 ; Zero Page, saves a byte&lt;/tt&gt;


There are more addressing modes, but for now stick with these. In case you were wondering about the LDAs and STAs, those are just names of instructions. On to the instructions!


The instructions are certain commands that tell the processor to do something. This may be move something into memory, add some numbers, jump to a different location, etc. There are 56 total instructions. The instructions that are used the most will be described following.


The first instruction you will learn is LDA. It stands for LoaD into A, which copies data into register A. The data can be a number, an address, or indexed address (more on this addressing mode next tutorial). See if you figure out this one: LDX. If you guessed LoaD into X, you're right. I don't think I need to explain what's LDY.


STA, the second most common instruction, stands for STore A, which stores the value of A into memory.  STA $2000 would store the current value of A into memory address $2000.  Its counterparts include STY and STX.

'''On enhancers'''

Some work will have to be done to make this contribution more sensible and clearer. I will do the work. I will help in improving grammar and at the same time help in making an expansion on the point you have raised. Enhancers are sequence elements that activate transcriptions from many, may be, thousands of base pairs up or down the stream. They, in fact, are classically known to exert preferential stimulation of the closest bitendem promoters.

All of the literature I've seen uses different terminology or spellings. &quot;prokariotes&quot; is instead &quot;procaryotes&quot; or &quot;prokaryotes&quot;.
Similarly, things such as &quot;RNA messenger (RNAm)&quot; are called &quot;messenger RNA (mRNA)&quot;. Is the spelling/terminology used in this article based on language from a country other than the USA?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Catalogue ==

Stamps are collectibles and are exchanged and traded extensively in many countries around the world.

Most postage stamps are very common either in condition used or mint (not used) condition. Fine used and mint unhinged are the to conditions most likely to be collected.

It may be hard to comprehend, but stamp catalogs exist that identify nearly every postage stamp ever created in the entire world. A collector with an interest in just one country or region may prefer a stamp catalog that describes only the stamps in the specific collecting area. For beginner collectors, a pocket catalog that identifies each stamp and lists them in chronological order may be all that is needed.


Yet it is very difficult to devine a valuation scheme in one or several currencies which reflect the true market value of any particular collectible. Therefore the following scheme is based on scarcity (and therefore value) and a basic coding is used in this catalogue:

{|
!Code:||        Number of stamps issued or believed to exist:
|-
|A||                 10s
|-
|B||                 100s
|-
|C||                 1,000s
|-
|D||                 10,000s
|-
|E||                 100,000s
|-
|F||                  1,000,000s
|}

== Inacuracies! ==

I am sorry, however, this page is very inacurate. For example, the &quot;white thing&quot; on a female betta is not eggs, but an ovipositor! As for keeping both sexes in the same tank is a bad idea. There should only be one male and on female! Multiple females will attack one male. Multiple males would need several thousand or so gallons, and the fights between them are not only a matter of tank size, but also that they have been bred to be more aggressive and dangerous, LITERALY down to the teeth! This article, as stated before, is very inacurate.[[User:Jourdy288|Jourdy288]] ([[User talk:Jourdy288|talk]]) 22:15, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

== Accurate now!! ==

I did a major edit. I'm a breeder myself and fixed it  :)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphing functions can be a very tedious part of math curriculum, so the use of graphing calculators as a tool for instruction and discovery can be very beneficial.  Graphing calculators allow students to see these visual representations without having to construct a graph by hand.  This allows students more time to analyze and interpret their graphs.


The large screen that is part of a graphing calculator is also very beneficial because it allows the student to have multiple calculations on the screen to compare and contrast information.  The graphing calculator can be used to generate lists of information and most have a randomization feature that help in this creation of lists.


The following websites contain resources for using graphing calculators

      <text xml:space="preserve">=What?=

Make it look like the picture on the right my foot. How am I supposed to do that? That section needs a lot more detail.

=KDE problem=

'''(CTRL+TAB) switches desktops in Linux KDE.  Need detailed instructions on how to switch between modes without using that key combination.'''

: I run KDE at home and do not recall having this problem.  I will look into it.  You can switch modes by following the instructions on this page:  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Detailing_Your_Simple_Person_2

: --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:24, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)


=Purpose of Extruding the front edges in ''Final Touches''=
I don't understand the purpose of extruding the 4 front edges of the hat.  What is being accomplished?  Does it have anything to do with the split seams from the doubled vertices?

Bturnip

: You're creating a brim for the hat.  A brim?  A rim?  What's it called?  Anyways, whatever you call the thing on the hat that's supposed to keep the sun out of your eyes.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 22:01, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: According to my dictionary it is called a 'peak'. --[[User:Pinzo|Pinzo]] 22:17, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

== Smoothing the hat ==

If I set the smooth to the hat it looks awful, with 12 dark lines following the edges. Does anybody know why is this?
How can I get it right?--[[User:Pinzo|Pinzo]] 22:20, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I got it. It happened that the 'spin' had the normals turned with each slice. Flipped them manually, and that's nice.
Can this be avoided when spinning the hat?
--[[User:Pinzo|Pinzo]] 23:17, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

: Next time you have that problem, in Edit Mode, select all vertices and press CTRL+NKEY.  It will prompt you if want to flip normals outside.  Choose yes.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:08, 10 July 2005 (UTC)


== Adding new vertices ==


I do not understand the needs of adding new vertices in section Creating the hat profile. After deleting three edges from the circle, it remains 9 edges, and from the image shown there are also 9 edges to build the hat.  


Did I miss something or '''GKEY''' combined with '''RMB''' and '''AKEY''' are sufficient to do the job?

--[[User:Miga|Miga]] 10:25, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Your not adding new vertices, more like rearranging the vertices.  I really want to know whats with this... -make sure you're in Object Mode (TAB) to add the hat as a separate object. (Note: It will cause problems if you do not switch into Object Mode)-.   In Object Mode my circle is made on the Z axis when it should be made on the x or y axis so I can spin the profile vertices on the z axis.  I stayed in Edit Mode and had better luck with this whole hat making ordeal.  And yes I'm using version 2.48

== Final touches ==

Can this sentence be made clearer? I con't understand the last part. 

''You need to be in top view during extrusion so that the cap bill comes forward and not down,if it was made from the top view''

= Keyboard Shortcut Mismatches result =
While editting the hat, it says &quot;Switch to Edge select mode (CTRL+TAB)&quot;.  At this point, CNTL+TAB is toggling between object mode and weight painting mode, a mode I had never touched before.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.7 with Blender 2.4.2(a?).

When in object mode, CTRL+TAB switches from object mode to weight painting mode. If you are in edit mode, it allows you to choose between edge, vertex or face select mode. So the problem i you were in object mode instead of edit mode.
== HELP! ==

I can't find the screw option in mesh tools!
:It's to the right of Spin and Spin Dup.  For this tutorial, though, you will want Spin, not Screw.—[[Special:Contributions/97.95.42.33|97.95.42.33]] ([[User talk:97.95.42.33|talk]]) 20:46, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

== Invisible mesh ==

When I go to add a circle mesh, it goes into edit mode but I can't see anything. If I try to select something with a right click it flares up yellow and then goes again, leaving me with still no edges or vertices visible. So I can't make my hat! What have I done wrong?

--[[User:81.159.183.85|81.159.183.85]] 14:13, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

== Oh Noes! ==

Sombody previously wrote here:
  ''I can't find mesh tools at all!''


I had this same problem, and found this page this when I went searching for a solution (so I am now updating the solution, since I couldn't find it explicitly answered anywhere else...had to hunt around to find it on the Manual/Meshes page).  The tutorials just says to hit f9 to get into edit mode, but it turns out that it may put you in either edit mode or in object mode when you hit f9.  If you then hit the TAB key, it will toggle between these modes.  In the object mode, you get the &quot;Mesh&quot; panel, and in the edit mode you get the &quot;Mesh Tools&quot; panel, which just makes you think you actually got into edit mode.   Hope this helps

== hat is flat ==

this feels like sending a message in a bottle, but here goes:

i've gone through this lesson twice now, and i still have the same problem:  the hat when finished is flat as a pancake.  i've looked at it from every angle, and yes it's flat.  so really, it's not a hat at all -- just a flat round thing.  i've paid very close attention to every detail in the instructions, and i'm sure i've done everything as instructed, but the hat has no height (or depth, of course).  please help.  i'm using blender 2.48.

== Flat hat ==

Your hat is flat because you spin the curve around the wrong axis. If you choose top view it spins around th z-axis and create a pancake.Don't push NUM7 when done with the selection, push NUM1.


thank you.  that works.  but shouldn't someone change the instructions -- or did i misread them?


You didn't misread them... I've gone through the tutorial with the same results.  I've made the necessary changes in the tutorial to include the proper views and axis information.  I am not sure if the original author rotated the original circle before editing, or if it was just one of those unavoidable situations where each version of Blender does things differently.  My update proceeds from the assumption that the face of the initial circle is visible in the view that the original author specified, that the other two views show only the edge, and that the original rotational orientation of the circular mesh was unchanged.  It's a kludge but it will work for now, until someone with a different version of blender can address whatever differences there are.

- Update:  I ran through this section of the tutorial step by step and made changes in all the references that were inconsistent, and added some more context to the troubleshooting section to take out most of the guesswork and ambiguity.

- Retraction of previous Update:  After making the changes to allow the tutorial to work with Blender 2.48a, I realized it was now broken for version 2.43 and older.  I reverted everything back and found a true fix for the situation, and updated the tutorial accordingly.

== == BIG UPDATE: == ==
After much work with many tutorials, I have found that nearly every difficulty such as these can be resolved by simply setting the '''&lt;big&gt;(i):&lt;/big&gt; USER PREFERENCES''' menu in the right way.  Newer versions of Blender (such as version 2.48) can be made compatible with older tutorials by changing some important settings:

 1) Find the &quot;User preferences&quot; window 
 2) Select the '''[EDIT METHODS]''' tab
 3) Under the header '''&quot;Add new objects&quot;''', click the '''&quot;Aligned to View&quot;''' button.
 4) ''Optional:'' For some tutorials it may also be helpful to click on the '''&quot;Switch to Edit Mode&quot;''' button.

Making these simple changes will &quot;unbreak&quot; tutorials written under Blender version 2.43, because when these older tutorials were written, new objects would automatically be oriented to whatever viewscreen orientation is being used.  Version 2.48 is set to use the global axis orientations by default, which is why object orientations are so often not aligned right when following older tutorials literally... there was no way of knowing a future version of Blender would be set up to ignore when you changed from top to front to side view.  Any time object rotations end up completely out of step with the older tutorials, these steps are your first best workaround.


== Spins in a curvy way in 2D (wrong axis) ==

When I clicked Spin after following the page's instructions exactly, I got [http://picpanda.com/viewer.php?file=2j0xf271byad2o0n54t.png this].  Why?—[[Special:Contributions/97.95.42.33|97.95.42.33]] ([[User talk:97.95.42.33|talk]]) 02:33, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

== Hat has a weird look... ==

Once I extruded the hat's front and followed the instructions exactly, I got [http://picpanda.com/viewer.php?file=3rvxaq32ix04jcv2dgbv.bmp this].  I extruded it just as far as the picture for that showed.  And it also has these weird...things outside the pink area.—[[Special:Contributions/97.95.42.33|97.95.42.33]] ([[User talk:97.95.42.33|talk]]) 20:42, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

== There is no circle! ==

I did Space-&gt;Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Circle and gave the properties according to the tutorial and hit Ok, but no circle appears anywhere. I see the name of the Circle at the bottom-right corner of the view. What gives?

== Questioning use of the word &quot;genatrix&quot;  ==

In the sentence, &quot;You could use any sort of mesh object here because you're about to reshape it into a custom 2D mesh (called a genatrix) that describes ...&quot; the word &quot;genatrix&quot; does not conform to the spelling of apparently the same word elsewhere in the section. Is it &quot;genatrix&quot; or &quot;generatrix?&quot; Or does &quot;genatrix&quot; mean something different?[[User:Mtjlt|Mtjlt]] ([[User talk:Mtjlt|talk]]) 11:57, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
:According to my Random House dictionary, the word is &quot;generatrix&quot;.  Sorry for the confusion. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 01:01, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

== Practical Joke? ==

I believe this section of the book contains what is either an error or a practical joke. 

Unless I have misread something several times, the instructions for creating a hat on this page begin by telling you to create a circle, select all the vertices in the circle and then erase them. If you do this, it means that you have created an editable object and then erased it completely leaving you with a blank page. It makes no sense.

== unexpected spinning result ==

Hi

So after completing the hat tutorial i found a difficulty once you have &quot;spun&quot; the hat. 

I would like some clarification. Does the hat spin around the 3d cursor? So basically the center of the hat will be where the 3d cursor is.

If so you should stipulate it in the tutorial as i got a hat that look more like a vase :P


== Blender 2.61: Ctrl+LMB doesn't create vertices. ==

I haven't messed with the hotkey settings, and under User preferences, Add new Vertex is, in fact, defined to be ctrl+LMB - but doing so in vertex edit mode doesn't add a vertex.

Is there some weird setting that's messed up? {{unsigned|76.240.225.166}}

== Create a mesh circle at the cursor, why? ==

After creating the mesh circle the instructions go on to the following:

    The newly-created mesh should be selected. If it isn't, select it by clicking  RMB  on it.
    Press  Tab  to edit the mesh.
    Activate Vertex select mode.
    Press  A  until all vertices are selected.
    Press  X  to erase all vertices.

The adding and removal of the circle mesh seems to be an unnecessary step, which seems to
have no purpose. Is the circle mesh needed ?, if not why is it added and then removed ?.
This part of the tutorial is confusing and unclear.
[[User:Collectionneur|Collectionneur]] ([[User talk:Collectionneur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Collectionneur|contribs]]) 02:30, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

:That confused me too. Maybe the steps are out of order, and you're supposed to delete the circle after creating the generatrix? I'll check the history to see if I can make sense of this...

UPDATE: I get it! You have to create a mesh in order to go into edit mode! I'll put that on the page to clear things up... [[User:Serpinium|Serpinium]] ([[User talk:Serpinium|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Serpinium|contribs]]) 10:50, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we will discuss some of the important elements to selecting an LMS Vendor.  Many organizations spend millions of dollars in trying to find the right company to customize a learning management solution.

There are several different sources online that tell you how to select an LMS Vendor. Throughout the search with my employer I found various resources that were helpful.  These resources provide information on defining a Learning Management System and selecting a vendor.  This section will deal primarily with selecting an LMS vendor.

==10 Steps to Successful Vendor Selection==
1. Determine and document your business requirements&lt;br&gt;
2. Research Vendors&lt;br&gt;
3. Conduct Vendor Demonstrations&lt;br&gt;
4. Narrow Down your Potential Vendors&lt;br&gt;
5. Conduct a LMS Needs Assessment&lt;br&gt;
6. Develop and Distribute the Purchase Requisition&lt;br&gt;
7. Prepare for Any Cultural Changes&lt;br&gt;
8. Narrow Your List and Evaluate Proposals&lt;br&gt;
9. Conduct Final Presentations&lt;br&gt;
10. Negotiate the Contract&lt;br&gt;

===Determining Business Requirements===
Determining your business requirements is the most crucial step in selecting a LMS vendor. If you don't know your requirements you won't be able to effectively communicate them to vendors. Here's a few important points about your business requirements:

*Document them - don't try to go from memory on what you think you need.
*First began by documenting your current state - how you conduct business today.
*Next record your future state - where you would like to be.

Consider how an LMS will help bridge the gap and enable you to meet your goals.

===Researching Vendors===
It is very easy to research vendors with the wealth of information that is online.  However, just because you find a vendor online, how will you know that vendor will meet the needs of your company. Inside of blindly searching for a vendor, the best method is to leverage industry standards or other companies with similar goals and objectives.

===Conducting Vendor Demonstrations===
One of the most time consuming aspects of working with vendors is the demonstrations and presentations. Below you can find some helpful information on making this process more efficient for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nails

As a rule of thumb, nails should enter the second member by twice the thickness of the material you are nailing through. Example: attaching 2 pieces for 2.54cm (1 inch) hard wood together, the nail should be 5.08cm (2 inches) long. Nails come in many different types, there are CC (concrete coated), bright (these have no coating), galvanized (exactly as the name implies), sinkers, screw, and that's about it. The nail used in a project needs to be the right type i.e.; if they are to be painted over the CC will tend to bleed through so brights should be used. If the entire project is to be of treated wood, as in a deck, then screw type galv. would be a proper nail. Headless or finish  nails are for inside jobs and are designed to be set (driven below surface), and the hole filled and painted over. Nails are a metal pin used with forced to drive into a material.

      <comment>/* SPC700 Overview */ Typo fix</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=System Overview=

The SPC700 is the coprocessor that coordinates SNES audio.  Once it is initialized with data and code sent from the SNES CPU, it manipulates the state of its accompanying digital signal processor (DSP), which produces the output audio.

== SPC700 Overview ==

The SPC700 has 64KB of memory for code and data.  Within this memory are memory-mapped registers, used for communicating with the SNES CPU, the DSP, and three available timers.

The SPC700 has 6 registers:

* A - An 8-bit accumulator
* X &amp; Y - 8-bit index registers
* SP - 8-bit stack pointer
* PC - 16-bit program counter
* PSW - 8-bit &quot;Program Status Word&quot;, which stores the status flags

The Y and A registers can be paired together for some operations to form a 16-bit register with Y as the upper byte.

== DSP Overview ==

The DSP has eight channels, each of which can play a 16-bit sound.  Each of the eight channels has separate left and right stereo volume, can be played at different pitches, and can have an Attack-Delay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) envelope applied to it.  A white noise source can be set to replace the sampled data on any of the eight channels.  Additionally, the DSP can apply an echo to the audio.  The 16-bit audio samples are read from the SPC700's 64KB memory space, where they are stored in a packed 4-bit lossily-compressed format.

== SPC700 memory map ==

* 0x0000 - 0x00FF - direct page 0
* 0x00F0 - 0x00FF - memory-mapped hardware registers
* 0x0100 - 0x01FF - direct page 1
* 0x0100 - 0x01FF - potential stack memory
* 0xFFC0 - 0xFFFF - IPL ROM

=== Direct-page addressing ===

Many instructions offer an addressing mode that accesses 1-byte memory addresses in the &quot;direct page&quot;.  This addressing mode yields shorter bytecode which presumably executes faster.  The direct page's upper byte is either 0x00 or 0x01, corresponding to the P bit in the PSW register.

=== The stack ===

The lower byte of the stack pointer is specified by the SP register; the upper byte is always 0x01.  The stack pointer is set to 0x01EF on restart by the IPL ROM and grows downward.

=== IPL ROM ===

On restart, the 64-byte chunk of memory at the end of the 64KB of RAM is initialized to the contents of the IPL ROM, which is where execution starts.  The code in the IPL ROM sets the stack pointer to 0x01EF, zeroes the memory from 0x0000 to 0x00EF, and then waits for data from the SNES via the input ports..

=== 00F0h Unknown ===
Anomie has done some tests with this register. A document on romhacking.net describes it.
=== 00F1h Control ===

* PC32 - Writing 1 in this bit will zero input for ports 2 and 3
* PC10 - Writing 1 in this bit will zero input for ports 1 and 0
* ST0-2 - These are for starting the timers.

  Warning: Writing to this register will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; restart/stop all of the timers.

=== 00F2h/00F3h DSP Registers ===
Writing to 00F2h sets the address of the DSP register to access. Writing to 00F3h changes the value of the register pointed to. Reading from 00F3h will return the value of the register pointed at. Writing a word to 00F2h is allowed and it can be used to simultaneously set the address and write a value to the register.

=== 00F4h-00F7h Ports ===
Reading from these ports will give you the values that the SNES set at $2140-$2143. Values written to these registers will be viewable by the SNES using the same $2140-$2143. The input of these ports can be cleared using the Control register.

=== 00FAh-00FFh Timer Settings ===
Registers 00FAh-00FCh are used to set the timer rate. Timers 0 &amp; 1 have a resolution of 125 microseconds. Timer 2 has a finer resolution of ~15.6 microseconds. 00FDh-00FFh are 4-bit registers containing the timer overflow count. Here is how the timers operate.&lt;br/&gt;

Each timer has an internal counter which is incremented at each clock input. If it equals the number in $FA-$FC (depending on which timer you're using) the corresponding counter register is incremented and the internal counter is reset. The counter registers ($FD-$FF) are 4-bit registers and can be read only. Reading from them will cause them to reset back to zero. If you don't read the counters in the limited time frame then they will overflow and be cleared to zero as well. The timer must be stopped before setting the 00FAh-00FCh registers. To start a timer write to bits 0-2 of the Control register. To stop a timer, reset the bits. Take note that writing to the control register will restart the existing timers.

== DSP Compression Format ==

The DSP plays a special ADPCM encoded sound format. The sample is made up of a series of 9 byte compression blocks. Each block holds 16 4-bit samples and a 1 byte header. 16-bit samples will get a 9/32 compression ratio, but 8-bit samples must be inflated to 16-bit before compression (giving them only 9/16 compression ratio). The first byte of each block contains the header.

=== Header ===
{| border=1
!width=&quot;40&quot;| 7 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 6 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 5 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 4 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 3 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 2 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 1 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 0
|-
|colspan=4 align=&quot;center&quot;| Range ||colspan=2 align=&quot;center&quot;| Filter || align=&quot;center&quot;| Loop || align=&quot;center&quot;| End
|}

* Range - This is the shift value for the data. It can be 0-12.
* Filter - This selects the filter coefficients used in the decoding process. (see table below)
* Loop -This bit marks the block as one that will be within a loop. The exact function of this bit is unknown, but some commercial spc samples that I have examined have this bit set for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; blocks in the sample.
* End - This bit marks the block as the last block in the sample. The DSP channel will terminate or jump to the loop point if it reaches this block.

=== Data ===
Each block contains 8 bytes of sample data (16 signed 4-bit samples). The higher nibble in each byte contains the sample that is to be decoded &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the one in the lower nibble.

=== Decoding Process ===
Here is an equation to estimate the 16-bit output of the DSP. Let y and z be the last two previously decoded samples. 'a' and 'b' are the filter coefficients selected by bits 2-3 of the header byte.

  sample = S + ay + bz
  S is the shifted data:
  S = (4-bit sample) &lt;&lt; Range

The DSP performs this procedure using minimal basic shifting operations; output accuracy won't be perfect. It also applies Gaussian interpolation to the output.

=== Filter Coefficients ===

      <comment>/* Binyanim */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hebrew is a root based language. Every verb is based on a 3 or 4 consonant root (שורש, shoresh). These letters form a skeleton around which vowels are placed to form a complete word.

== Binyanim ==

The patterns that dictate which vowels are placed and where are called binyanim (בנין), or constructions. There are 7 binyanim:

#Pa'al פעל. Active, Mild
#*Example: he ate
#Pi'el פיעל. Active, Intense
#*Example: he consumed
#Hif'il הפעיל. Active, Causative
#*Example: he fed (to cause to eat)
#Hitpa'el התפעל. Reflexive (subject acts on itself)
#*Example: he fed himself
#Nif'al נפעל. Passive, Mild (sometimes reflexive)
#*Example: he was eaten
#Pu'al פועל. Passive, Intense
#*Example: he was consumed
#Huf'al הפעל. Passive, Causative
#*Example: he was fed 

Not all roots are meaningful in all 7 binyanim. In addition, some do not have the expected meaning. Therefore, it is advisable to learn each root-binyan combination as its own verb.

== Root type ==

The roots themselves are divided into 3 types: Strong, Weak and Hollow.

Strong roots have roots in which all letters appear in all conjugations.

Weak roots have letters that disappear in some conjugations. These letters are called weak letters. The weak letters are: א alef, ע ayin, ה heh, ח chet, י yod, ו vav, and נ nun.

Hollow verbs are verbs in which the 2nd root letter is a ו vav or a י yod.  These disappear in conjugation.

Weak and hollow root types can be abbreviated using a 2 letter abbreviation. To denote the position of the weak letter, פ (first letter), ע (second letter), or ל (third letter) is written in the first position. Then the weak letter is written in the 2nd position. For example, roots with a ה in the third position are abbreviated ל&quot;ה, while hollow roots are abbreviated ע&quot;ו or ע&quot;י.

In addition to the lessons that are organized by topic, some vocabulary is organized by [[Hebrew/Roots|roots]].

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This section covers the Java platform classes used for '''basic input and output'''. But before we begin we need to have a concrete understanding of what input and output means in programming. To grasp this concept, think of the Java platform as a ''system''.

==Understanding input and output==
The Java platform is an isolated entity, a space on your OS in a way, where everything outside this system is its ''environment''. The interaction between the system and its environment is a two-way dialog of sorts. Either the system receives messages from its environment, or it conveys its messages to the same. When a message is received to the system, it is called an ''[[w:Input|input]]'', its opposite is an ''[[w:Output|output]]''. On a whole, this communication is termed ''[[w:Input/output|input/output]]'' abbreviated as ''I/O''.

The following chapters are designed to introduce basic input and output in Java, including reading text input from the keyboard, outputting text to the monitor, and reading/writing files from the file system.  More advanced user interaction using Graphics and [[w:Graphical User Interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) programs is taken up in the later section on [[Java Programming/Swing|Swing]].

===Simple Java Output: Writing to the Screen===
Writing to the screen is very easy, and can be accomplished using one of two methods:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;
|{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: Print &quot;Hello world&quot; without advancing to a new line'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
System.out.print(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|
{{XCode|1='''Output on the screen'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}
|-
|{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.2: Print &quot;Hello world&quot; and advance to a new line'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|
{{XCode|1='''Output on the screen'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Hello world

&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}
|}

===Simple Java Input: Inputting from the keyboard===
As of version 1.5.0, Java provides a class in the &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; package called &lt;code&gt;Scanner&lt;/code&gt; that simplifies keyboard input.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.3: Inputting with &lt;code&gt;Scanner&lt;/code&gt;'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
Scanner kbdIn = new Scanner(System.in); // Instantiating a new Scanner object
System.out.print(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;); // Printing out the prompt
String name = kbdIn.nextLine(); // Reading a line of input (until the user hits enter) from the keyboard
// and putting it in a String variable called name
System.out.println(&quot;Welcome, &quot; + name); // Printing out welcome, followed by the user's name
&lt;/source&gt;}}

{{XCode|1='''On the screen'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Enter your name: John Doe
Welcome, John Doe
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}

Alternatively, one could write a method to handle keyboard input:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.4: Line reader'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public String readLine() {
  // Creates a new BufferedReader object
  BufferedReader x = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

  // Reads a line of input and returns it directly
  return x.readLine();
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
Note that the code above shouldn't be used in most applications, as it creates new Objects every time the method is run.
A better alternative would be to create a separate class file to handle keyboard input.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Jazz? ==
Jazz is a label that encompasses many aspects of an internationally loved art form and the culture that surrounds it. Its rich history ties it originally to the songs and rhythms of ancient African societies, which are associated with sacred traditions that in turn made way, if one looks closely enough, for the innovations of modern computing. As European colonials brought slaves to the Americas, the music of Africa came with them, leading to contributions like gospel, ragtime, and, perhaps most importantly, the blues. Jazz music can be &quot;legit:&quot; official and classically regimented, like the Gershwin brothers and Scott Joplin; it can also be &quot;free:&quot; chaotic, improvised, and experimental, like Ornette Coleman and the later work of Miles Davis. Jazz is also found in dance, art, and poetry, and no form of rock or hip-hop would have ever happened without it.

== Early Jazz ==
Jazz music has its earliest roots in Africa. Throughout the 1700s Africans were taken by the millions to the North American colonies for the purpose of slavery.  There, on plantations,  slaves would sing work songs with each other in a ''call and response'' manner. These songs still exist in the form of Spirituals today.

With the ending of the Civil War in 1865 came freedoms these men and women, most of whom had been born in America, had never known before. Also around this time, a new music started popping up around the Louisiana delta, in and around New Orleans.  Marching bands were formed, with odd instrumentations consisting mostly of brass instruments, playing music almost entirely by ear.

In the early 1900s, a new style of music called Ragtime started gaining popularity. Ragtime is characterized by the ''stride'' left-hand part (&quot;boom chick&quot; type of bass line) and syncopated rhythms in the right hand part on the piano. Famous names of this genre include Scott Joplin and &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; Morton.

Also out of New Orleans, along with Ragtime, was the Dixieland Jazz style, characterized by the distinct style of counterpoint and stride bass line.

Then, just a couple decades later, came a new style called Swing. The man most responsible for the growth of Swing in the mainstream was Louis Armstrong. Armstrong was known for playing using the &quot;swing eighths&quot;, which is characterized by playing the two eighth notes of a subdivided quarter in a non-symmetrical fashion. Below is an example of how ''straight eighths'' (normal eighths) music might be notated:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Straight8ths.png|Straight 8ths]]

&lt;br&gt;
In the swing style, however, 8th notes are often played as though one subdivides the quarter note as an eighth note triplet and plays a quarter note-eighth note combination. This is a rather technical way to describe it, and indeed people originally thought that it was music solely of feeling that could not be written down. The first person to write down jazz successfully was Jelly Roll Morton. Swing rhythm might be notated as below:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:TripletSwing.png|Triplet Swing]]

&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes, swing rhythms are played as a dotted quaver followed by a semiquaver. This is sometimes called ''heavy swing'', and is most common in the ''Dixie Land'' style. This would be notated:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:DottedSwing.png|Dotted Swing]]

&lt;br&gt;
Playing music with a ''swing'' is characteristic of nearly all forms of jazz, and should not be confused with the Swing music sub-genre.

== Bebop ==
In the 1940s, after the Great Depression and two World Wars, a new style of music was emerging out of New York city. Bebop sprouted out of the artists' need for self-expression. Some artists at the time were tired of playing Swing for white audiences. As a result of this, a new music style emerged in the clubs and bars of New York.

Bebop is characterized by fast tempos and improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody.

== Jazz Evolution ==
Jazz quickly evolved throughout the 20th Century. A sub-genre was Swing, which featured high energy and infectious melodies. Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller are notable leaders.

After Swing, Cool Jazz became popular, growing from its West Coast roots. One of the most popular musicians of the genre is Dave Brubeck, who with his album ''Time Out'' first challenged the notion that jazz could only be in 4/4 or waltz-style 3/4 time. It ignited a firestorm of controversy, but was immensely popular thanks to the single &quot;Take Five.&quot;

An era of experimentation followed Cool Jazz with Miles Davis leading the way. Fusion, the attempt to blend jazz and rock and roll, also came about during this time. Notable fusion artists include Jaco Pastorius and the band Weather Report. Latin jazz also exploded during this time, led by people such as Chick Corea. Free Jazz also developed during this era, lead by Ornette Coleman. Free Jazz is played without a definite rhythmic structure and while there is some element of randomness, there is still a cohesive bond between the players. Some dispute whether Free Jazz is real jazz, or even real music.

Recently, jazz has splintered into a large grouping of subgenres without one truly leading the way. Smooth jazz has gained some popularity thanks to artists like Kenny G, but it is reviled by many as &quot;not really jazz&quot; because no improv happens and usually 'smooth' songs are just vamped on one chord. Other artists are trying to blend jazz with other forms of music, such as the band Béla Fleck and the Flecktones who combine jazz with bluegrass, funk, latin, reggae, and Asian music. Fleck himself plays banjo, an indication of the iconoclastic nature of the group. 

(this should get you all off to a nice start)

== Shading ==
The shading part of this tutorial needs to be updated.  :(


== resize button-groops windows XP only? ==

In windows XP I can resize the buttongroops (actually the font-size) by scrolling the mouseweel while holding down controlbutton. I don't know if this is also possible in other OS.

== continuety problems ==

um, it says &quot;you have modeled a person&quot; but we haven't even gotten to making cubes yet!
:It says &quot;suppose.&quot; It's asking you to imagine that you've already done it.

== Resizing buttons ==

I can also resize the button panes by CTRL + SCROLL (using GNOME) --[[User:Adrigen|Aids]] 06:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

on my mac it works by holding down ctrl+cmd plus using the scroll wheel. This feature should definitely be documented. By mistake I had them magnified like crazy and I did not find how to make the buttons smaller again.

:I added zooming to the manipulations section.--[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:53, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

==Images needed==
What's needed now, I think, are screenshots and VTT's for the Shading, Object, Editing, and Scene contexts.  Some of this material will eventually get moved to a later tutorial.--[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:53, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

I'm new to Blender and am going through this guide with 2.57, which is apparently much different in its organization of the Buttons Windows. On some previous pages (like the one describing windows generally), there were screen shots of 2.5--which was useful. This would indeed be useful with this page, but for me the more difficult matter is that it seems that there has been significant changes to what menus appear (Render, Scene, World, Object, Object Constraints, Modifiers, Object Data) their submenus/windows. The things referenced here don't match up with 2.5 very well.

Thanks for putting this guide together, though--it's generally quite hopeful.

== Information for those using Blender 2.57 ==

As stolen from a Google result...

Buttons window = Properties window now. (Right side of screen by default)
Modifiers = see the spanner icon in this window
Link and Materials = see the round (sort of red) material icon in this window
Multires = under Add Modifier (Generate --&gt; Multiresolution)
Shapes = see the Object Data (triangle icon) in this window

The moar you know :) [[Special:Contributions/207.210.29.71|207.210.29.71]] ([[User talk:207.210.29.71|discuss]]) 04:50, 19 May 2011 (UTC)


== Change URL ==

Hi guys,

I just updated this page and noticed that the URL didn't change. This might be a little problematic on the Noob to Pro homepage where the page titles are listed according to their URL. Anyone know how to change it? --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 09:26, 25 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

I have to wonder if these are related...

#[[Beekeeping|you keep boxes full of thousands of stinging insects]]
#[[Talk:Cookbook:Habanero|you eat plants that taste like riot control spray and bear repellant]]

Any other hobbies that cause agonizing pain? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:02, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:Now that gave me a good hardy chuckle. I figure variety is the spice of life. Either way after a few habaneros, bee stings don’t seem to bother as much. As for other hobbies, I also SCUBA dive, and if not done properly I could imagine that could get rather painful. I’m afraid though that I don’t do anything like sword swallowing or juggling flaming torches, but hey there is always next year. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 15:34, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Memory Mapping ==
There are two types of SNES cartridges, the SNES community refers to them as LoROM and HiROM cartridges. Both have different memory mapping.

Banks $80 to $FF are mostly a mirror of the above. ROM mapped to banks $80 to $FF may be accessed at 3.58 Mhz rather than 2.68 Mhz depending on how register $420D is set.

There are two main models for memory that are used:  LoROM and HiROM. LoROM means that the address line A15 is ignored by the cartridge, so the cartridge doesn't distinguish between $0000-$7FFF and $8000-$FFFF in any bank. Smaller ROMs use this model to prevent wasted space in banks $00-$3F.

==Misc locations==
At the end of bank 0, 64 bytes of cartridge information are stored. This section includes info such as interrupt vectors, title, version, etc. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+
!location!!name!!description
|-
|$FFC0  ||Game title.||21 bytes, usually uppercase.
|-
|$FFD5  ||ROM makeup byte.||xxAAxxxB; AA==11 means FastROM, B is HiROM
|-
|$FFD6  ||ROM type.||ROM/RAM/SRAM/DSP1/FX
|-
|$FFD7  ||ROM size.
|-
|$FFD8  ||SRAM size.
|-
|$FFD9  ||Creator license ID code.
|-
|$FFDB  ||Version #.
|-
|$FFDC  ||Checksum complement.
|-
|$FFDE  ||Checksum.
|-
|}

===Interrupt vectors===
Vectors are all 2 bytes. Program execution begins in emulation mode at the reset vector ($FFFC-D).

====native mode vectors====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!name!!location!!description
|-
|COP   ||$FFE4, 5||Co-processor enable. Not used for the Super NES.

|-
|NMI   ||$FFEA, B||Non-maskable interrupt. Called when vertical refresh (vblank) begins.
|-
|RESET ||$FFEC, D|| unused
|-
|IRQ   ||$FFEE, F||Interrupt request. Can be set to be called at a certain spot in the horizontal refresh cycle.
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">Emulating games on a Windows OS is actually very easy. There are plenty of programs for emulating everything from GB to the PS2. 

Generally you have the software and either a rom image or a disk (image or otherwise). Emulation on the simpler platforms like the GB, GBC, GBA, SNES or NES will not require additional tweaking beyond simply running the software and selecting the image. 

More complicated systems such as the Dreamcast, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 will require that the emulator be set up with plugins; these specify how different qualities are rendered on your system (Graphics, Sound, Controllers, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In some situations we need a new kind of probability.

===Examples===
We shall throw two dice: the probability of getting double six is 1/36. We have thrown the dice, but they are still under the cup: the probability of double six still is considered to be 1/36. Now we have someone else look under the cup at the result, and they tell us that at least one of the dice is a 6. What will the probability be of double six? Although we ask for the &quot;probability&quot; of double six, it's not the original probability we're talking about. It's a new kind of probability of the event &quot;double six&quot; under the condition that we know that another event  has occurred, i.e. the event that one of the dice shows six. We call it &quot;conditional probability&quot;. It indicates how likely the event &quot;double six&quot; is amongst all events in which (at least) one of the dice shows six. In 11 of the 36 possibilities at least one of the dice shows six. Thus, the probability of one of the dice showing six is 11/36 and the probability of double six is 1/36. Hence, the conditional probability of double six, given one die shows six is (1/36)/(11/36) = 1/11. We write this conditional probability as:

:P( &quot;double six&quot; | &quot;at least one six&quot; ),

using the same letter P as for the original probability, and separating the event of which the conditional probability is indicated from the event that states the condition by a vertical line (&quot;|&quot;).

As another example we pick at random an inhabitant of the UK. The probability of the chosen person to be a woman (W) is 1/2, it's nothing else than the fraction women amongst the British.  What if we are informed that the chosen person is working in a hospital (H)? It now comes down to the fraction of women amongst hospital staff, let's say 0.7. So we have:

:P(W) = 0.5
and
:P(W|H) = 0.7.

From these examples we learn:

The conditional probability of an event A, given the (occurrence of) the event B, is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}&lt;/math&gt;,

provided P(B) &gt; 0. In the case where P(B) = 0, the conditional probability of A given B is meaningless, but for completeness we define P(A|B) = 0 for P(B) = 0

&lt;!--This is known as Bayes' theorem. 

This is not true, so I marked this as comment--&gt;
 
It follows from this formula that P(A|B)P(B) = P(A and B).

'''Independent events'''
Intuitively, we would like two events, A and B, to be independent if P(A|B) = P(A), that is, if A is as likely to occur whether or not B has occurred. In this case, the occurrence of A is independent of the occurrence of B.


However, P(A|B) = P(A) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; P(A and B)/P(B) = P(A) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).


Therefore, A is independent from B &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; B is independent from A &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).

First, some MUMPS terminology-

*'''Routines'''  - the term for programs, lines of commands in sequence.
**Each routine has a name (RoutineName) which is used to execute it by way of the DO command.
**An up arrow ^ (caret character) is a prefix to the RoutineName distinguishing it as a routine versus a label within the current routine.
**Traditionally a routine is about a page in length as a logical section that is easily visible as a cognitive unit.
*'''Globals''' are the persistent database variables in MUMPS. These are a unique feature.
**Global Names begin with up arrow (caret) also.
**Global names have a comma-separated list in parentheses of subscripts as a multi-dimensional array.
**Subscripts create a heirarchical database, which may be huge, may be shared among many simultaneous tasks.
**Globals are persistent on the Hard Drive (or other devices like flash drives) as they are the database representation in MUMPS.
**The intrinsic nature of globals in the MUMPS language largely hide the necessity of application programmers dealing with issues of file opening, buffering, caching, encryption, compression, etc. These are managed with historic sophistication by the binary tree encoding and dynamic creation of the MUMPS system. See MUMPS as an Operating System.

     ^PtData(ClinicId,PtNum,VisitNum,NoteNum,Line)=  ...  
     ;
     ;where  data is separated by Clinic first, then by patient, then visit, then note,
     ;   and the node itself contains the text for one line of the patient note.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{warning|This page started life as an introduction to the most basic concepts of trigonometry, such as measuring an angle.  Done properly this is an advanced topic.  This page has now been moved/renamed into book 3 to take on that role, and needs considerable revision.  Some content that is still here may need to be integrated back into book 1}}


==Introduction to Angles==

[[image:2D-Angle.png|right|thumb|250px|An angle between two lines in a 2-dimensional plane]]

An angle is formed when two lines intersect; the point of intersection is called the '''vertex'''.  We can think of an angle as the wedge-shaped space between the lines where they meet.  Note that if both lines are extended through the meeing point, there are in fact four angles.

The size of the angle is the degree of rotation between the lines.  The more we must rotate one line to meet the other, the larger the angle is.

Suppose you wish to measure the angle between two lines exactly so that you can tell a remote friend about it:  draw a circle with its center located at the meeting of the two lines, making sure that the circle is small enough to cross both lines, but large enough for you to measure the distance along the circle's edge, the circumference, between the two cross points.  Obviously this distance depends on the size of the circle, but as long as you tell your friend both the radius of the circle used, and the length along the circumference, then your friend will be able to reconstruct the angle exactly.

==Definition of an Angle==

An angle is determined by rotating a ray about its endpoint.
The starting position of 
the ray is called the ''initial side'' of the angle.
The ending position of the ray is called the ''terminal side''.
The endpoint of the ray is called its ''vertex''.
''Positive angles'' are generated by counter-clockwise rotation.
''Negative angles'' are generated by clockwise rotation.

Consequently an angle has four parts: its vertex, its initial side, its terminal side, and its rotation.  

An angle is said to be in ''standard position'' when it is drawn in a cartesian coordinate system in such a way that its vertex is at the origin and its initial side is  the positive x-axis.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Angle measure.svg||300px|an angle in standard position]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Definition of a Triangle==

A triangle is a planar (flat) shape with three straight sides.  An angle is formed between each two sides of a triangle, and a triangle has three angles, hence the name tri-angle.  So a triangle has three straight sides and three angles.

If you give me three lengths, I can only make a triangle from them if the greatest length is less than the sum of the other two.  Three lengths that do not make the sides of a triangle are your height, the height of the nearest tree, the distance from the top of the tree to the center of the sun.

===Triangle Ratios===

Angles are not affected by the length of lines: an angle is invariant under transformations of scale, that is:

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
If you make the triangle bigger, &lt;br/&gt;
but keep the sides in the same ratio, &lt;br/&gt;
its angles won't change.
{{TrigBoxClose}}

===Right Angles=== 

An angle of particular significance is the right angle: the angle at each corner of a square or a rectangle. A rectangle can always be divided into two triangles by drawing a line from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner.

It is also true that every right-angled triangle is half a rectangle.

[[Image:rightTriangle.png|left|thumb|Right Triangle]]

A rectangle has four sides; they are generally of two different lengths: two long sides and two short sides.  (A rectangle with all sides equal is a square.)  When we split the rectangle into two right-angled triangles, each triangle has a long side and a short side from the rectangle as well as a copy of the split line.

So the area of a right-angled triangle is half the area of the rectangle from which it was split.  Looking at a right-angled triangle, we can tell what the long and short sides of that rectangle were; they are the sides, the lines, that meet at a right angle.  The area of the complete rectangle is the long side times the short side. The area of a right-angled triangle is therefore half as much.

===Right Triangles and Measurement===
[[Image:Construction of bisection.svg|350px|right|How to bisect an angle]]
It is possible to [[w:bisection|bisect]] any angle using only circles (which can be drawn with a compass) and straight lines by the following procedure:

# Call the vertex of the angle O.  Draw a circle centered at O.
# Mark where the circle intersects each ray.  Call these points A and B.
# Draw circles centered at A and B with equal radii, but make sure that these radii are large enough to make the circles intersect at two points.  One sure way to do this is to draw line segment AB and make the radius of the circles equal to the length of that line segment. On the diagram, circles A and B are shown as near-half portions of a circle.
# Mark where these circles intersect, and connect these two points with a line.  This line bisects the original angle.

A proof that the line bisects the angle is found in [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI9.html Proposition 9 of Book 1] of the ''Elements''.

Given a right angle, we can use this process to split that right angle indefinitely to form any binary fraction (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^n}, n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{32}...&lt;/math&gt;) of it.  Thus, we can measure any angle in terms of right angles.  That is, a measurement system in which the size of the right angle is considered to be one.

&lt;!-- This will move to later in the book when we talk about radians.--&gt;
==Introduction to Radian Measure==
{|
|[[Image:En_Radian_cropped_color.png|right|frame]]Of course, it is equally possible to start with a different sized angle and split it into two equal angles.  We might consider the angle made by half a circle to be &quot;one&quot;, or the angle made by a full circle to be &quot;one&quot;.

Trigonometry is simplified if we choose the following strange angle as &quot;one&quot;:
*# Draw a circle with the radius marked.
*# From the point where the radius meets the circumference of the circle, measure one radius length along the circumference of the circle moving counterclockwise and mark this point.
*# Draw a line from this mark back to the center of the circle.
*# The angle so formed is considered to be of size one in trigonometry; in order to tell your friends that this is the method you were using, you would say 'measuring in radians'.
|}
====Understanding the three sides of a Radian====
To illustrate how the three sides of a radian relate to one another try the below thought experiment:
*# Assume you have a piece of string that is exactly the length of the radius of a circle.
*# Assume you have drawn a radian in the same circle.  The radian has 3 points.  One is the center of your circle and the other two are on the circumference of the circle where the sides of the radian intersect with the circle.
*# Attach one end of the string at one of the points where the radian intersects with the circumference of the circle.
*# Take the other end of the string and, starting at the point you chose in Step 2 above, trace the circumference of the circle towards the second point where the radian intersects with the circle until the string is pulled tight.
*# You will see that the end of the string travels past the second point.
*# This is because the string is now in a straight line.  However, the radian has an arc for its third side, not a straight line.  Even though a radian has three equal sides, the arc's curve causes the two points where the radian intersects with the circle to be closer together than they are to the third point of the triangle, which is at the center of our circle in this example.
*# Now, with the string still pulled tight, find the half way point of the string, then pull it onto the circumference of the circle while allowing the end of the string to move along the circle's circumference.  The end of the string is now closer to the second point because the path of the string is closer to the path of the circle's circumference.
*# We can keep improving the fit of the string's path to the path of the circle's circumference by dividing each new section of the string in half and pulling it towards the circumference of the circle.

====Is a radian affected by the size of its circle?====

Does it matter what size circle is used to measure in radians?  Perhaps using the radius of a large circle will produce a different angle than that produced by the radius of a small circle.  The answer is no.

[[Image:RadianDemo1.png|right|thumb|400px|Two different size radian-arcs have the same angle-measure regardless of their radius.]]


Recall our radian and circle from the experiment in the subsection above.  Draw another circle inside the first circle, with the same center, but with half the radius.  You will see that you have created a new radian inside the smaller circle that shares the same angle as the radian in the larger circle.  We know that the two sides of the radians emanating from the center of the circles are equal to the radius of their respective circle.  We also know that the third side of the radian in the larger circle (the arc) is also equal to the larger circle's radius.  But how do we know that the third side of the radian in the smaller circle (the arc that follows the circumference of the smaller circle) is equal to the radius of the smaller circle?  To see why we do know that the third side of the smaller circle's radian is equal to its radius, we first connect the two points of each radian that intersect with the circle with each other.  By doing so, you will have created two [[w:isosceles triangle|isosceles triangle]]s (triangles with two equal sides and two equal angles).

An isosceles triangle has two equal angles and two equal sides.  If you know one angle of any isosceles triangle and the length of two sides that make up that angle, then you can easily deduce the remaining characteristics of the isosceles triangle.  For instance, if the two equidistant sides of an isosceles triangle intersect to form an angle that is equal to 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, then you know the remaining angles must both equal 70º.  Since we know that the equidistant sides of our two isosceles triangles make up our known angle, then we can deduce that both of our radians (when converted to isosceles triangles with straight lines) have identical second and third angles.  We also know that triangles with identical angles, regardless of their size, will have the length of their sides in a constant ratio to each other.  For instance, we can deduce that an isosceles triangle will have sides that measure 2 meters by 4 meters by 4 meters if we know that an isoscleses triangle with identical angles measures 1 meter by 2 meters by 2 meters.  Therefore, in our example, our isosceles triangle formed by the second smaller circle will have a third side exaclty equal to half of the third side of the isosceles triangle created by the larger circle.  The relationship between the size of the sides of two triangles that share identical angles is also found in the relationship between radius and circumference of two circles that share the same center point - they will share the exact same ratio.  In our example then, since the radius of our second smaller circle is exactly half of the larger circle, the circumference between the two points where the radian of the smaller circle intersect (which we have shown is one half of the distance between the two similar points on the larger circle) will share the same exact ratio.  And there you have it - the size of the circle does not matter.

===Using Radians to Measure Angles===

Once we have an angle of one radian, we can chop it up into binary fractions as we did with the right angle to get a vast range of known angles with which to measure unknown angles. A protractor is a device which uses this technique to measure angles approximately.  To measure an angle with a protractor: place the marked center of the protractor on the corner of the angle to be measured, align the right hand zero radian line with one line of the angle, and read off where the other line of the angle crosses the edge of the protractor.  A protractor is often transparent with angle lines drawn on it to help you measure angles made with short lines: this is allowed because angles do not depend on the length of the lines from which they are made.

If we agree to measure angles in radians, it would be useful to know the size of some easily defined angles. We could of course simply draw the angles and then measure them very accurately, though still approximately, with a protractor: however, we would then be doing physics, not mathematics.  

The ratio of the length of the circumference of a circle to its radius is defined as 2π, where '''π''' is an invariant independent of the size of the circle by the argument above.  Hence if we were to move 2π radii around the circumference of a circle from a given point on the circumference of that circle, we would arrive back at the starting point.  We have to conclude that the size of the angle made by one circuit around the circumference of a circle is 2π radians.  Likewise a half circuit around a circle would be π radians. Imagine folding a circle in half along an axis of symmetry: the resulting crease will be a diameter, a straight line through the center of the circle.  Hence a straight line has an angle of size π radians.

Folding a half circle in half again produces a quarter circle which must therefore have an angle of size π/2 radians.  Is a quarter circle a right angle? To see that it is: draw a square whose corner points lie on the circumference of a circle.  Draw the diagonal lines that connect opposing corners of the square, by symmetry they will pass through the center of the circle, to produce 4 similar triangles.  Each such triangle is isoceles, and has an angle of size 2π/4 =  π/2 radians where the two equal length sides meet at the center of the circle. Thus the other two angles of the triangles must be equal and sum to π/2 radians, that is each angle must be of size π/4 radians. We know that such a triangle is right angled, we must conclude that an angle of size π/2 radians is indeed a right angle.

===Summary and Extra Notes===

In summary: it is possible to make deductions about the sizes of angles in certain special conditions using geometrical arguments.  However, in general, geometry alone is not powerful enough to determine the size of unknown angles for any arbitrary triangle.  To solve such problems we will need the help of trigonometric functions. 

In principle, all [[w:angle|angle]]s and [[w:trigonometric function|trigonometric function]]s are defined on the [[../The_unit_circle|unit circle]]. The term ''unit'' in mathematics applies to a single measure of any length. We will later apply the principles gleaned from unit measures to larger (or smaller) scaled problems. All the functions we need can be derived from a triangle inscribed in the unit circle: it happens to be a [[w:right triangle|right-angled triangle]]. [[Image:Define_a_radian.png|right|thumb|150px|The hypotenuse rotate counter-clockwise ]]

The center point of the unit circle will be set on a [[w:cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]], with the circle's centre at the origin of the plane &amp;mdash; the point (0,0). Thus our circle will be divided into four sections, or [[w:quadrant|quadrant]]s.

Quadrants are always counted counter-clockwise, as is the default rotation of [[w:angular velocity|angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (omega). Now we inscribe a triangle in the first quadrant (that is, where the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are assigned positive values) and let one leg of the angle be on the ''x''-axis and the other be parallel to the ''y''-axis. (Just look at the illustration for clarification). Now we let the [[w:hypotenuse|hypotenuse]] (which is always 1, the radius of our ''unit'' circle) rotate [[Wiktionary:counter-clockwise|counter-clockwise]]. You will notice that a new triangle is formed as we move into a new quadrant, not only because the sum of a triangle's angles cannot be beyond 180&amp;deg;, but also because there is no way on a two-dimensional plane to imagine otherwise.

== clarification for Summary and Extra Notes section ==

Can someone address the following statement appearing in the 4th paragraph of the Summary and Extra Notes section:

''Now we let the hypotenuse (which is always 1, the radius of our unit circle) rotate counter-clockwise.''

Actually the entire 4th paragraph seems confusing to me.  Is it trying to explain how angles are measured in the cartesian plane?  consider revising this section.
--[[User:209.67.181.254|209.67.181.254]] 00:12, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

The last section of the paragraph starting from &quot;Quadrants are always counted counter-clockwise,....&quot; is meaningless
The hypotenuse is equal to the square root of (2) not to 1 as in the aside picture

-'''The image changed , it's now clarify what the author say'''

== More Illustrations ==

That statement in the triangle ratios section, &quot;In particular, a triangle can be divided into 4 congruent triangles by connecting the mid-points on the sides of the original triangle together, each congruent triangle is similar on half scale to the original triangle&quot;, needs an illustration really bad.  It would really help those of us who actually read these wiki articles on math to learn it and are not math geniuses. Thanks

== More Clarity ==

In the &quot;In Simple Terms&quot; Section, under the subsection &quot;Introduction to Radian Measure&quot; --  I don't believe that this section is as clear as it could be. 

=== Textually ===
Textually speaking: If I understand the section correct, the step by step exercise involves the assumption that one is using a string of the length of the radius. If this is the case it would be good to state this explicitly. Were someone to be trying to follow along using a compass, they could easily become confused and assume that after extending the radius to the circumference, we'll mark this as Pt. 1, that they should then use the radius length to mark another point on the circumference using the radius length and then to use another radius length to connect the second point back to the center of the circle in order to create an equilateral triangle with three sides the same length, i.e. 1 radius. This would make the circumference between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 to be larger than one radius. A straight line between two points in 2 or 3-dimensional space is shorter than a curved line between the two points (or something like that, I must admit I haven't touched a math text since 1998 so I may be getting this wrong). The idea is, that if one is using a string here, then one is able to &quot;trace&quot; the circumference of the circle with the string for the length of the string, i.e. 1 radius, marking this point Pt. 2. This would make the length of the curvature of the circle, i.e. the circumference traced, equal to 1 radius. Thus the line between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 would be LESS THAN the circumference length between the two points of 1 radius. The distance between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, making this third side of the triangle less than 1 radius. We would therefore have a triangle with two equal sides, each of 1 radius length extending out from the center of the circle and one line between the two points that must be less than 1 radius while the length of the circumference that shares Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 with this third side of our triangle being equal in length to the other sides of the triangle, all of them being 1 radius in length. Overall, tell people whether they should be using a string here or a compass. 

=== Visually ===

Visually, this could be shown by using the types of hash-marks employed in geometry. The two radius sides of our triangle would have 1 hash-mark, the length of the circumference of our circle between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 would also have 1 hash-mark and the straight line between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 would have 2 hash-marks to indicate that it is equal in length to neither the radius lines or the circumference of the circle between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2. It might also be useful to show another example where we use the radius of the circle to create an equilateral triangle within the circle that touches the circumference of the circle at Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 (Pt. 1 is same as above but Pt. 2 here would be diff. from Pt. 2 above) and with our hash-marks indicate that all the sides of this triangle have equal lengths of 1 hash-mark but that now the circumference between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 is not one radius in length by marking it with 2 hash-marks and further writing an indication that this length of circumference is NOT equal to a radian and the angle formed within is NOT equal to a radian. I will try to draw a makeshift image to show what I mean. I don't know how to upload the image here so if you'd like me to do that you'll have to explain how. I read the help file on image uploads but I don't want to mark up your nice looking page. Overall: Geometry-like hash-marks help.


== Relevance Needed ==
This &quot;simple terms&quot; introduction needs introduction of its own. Rather than some arcane discussion of how to bisect angles, we need a relation of trigonometry to our modern world. We need a discussion of cell-phone triangulation; we need a discussion of how a bridge or building will collapse without proper angle calculation; we need discussion of electromagnetic wave calculations for antennas and cooking of food; etc.

Like others mention in this discussion, I agree it needs pictures and diagrams; sore need. This is the age of the internet, not some dried up text in the back of the teacher lounge acting as a coaster.

== I'm not sure what this page adds ==

I've made a few cosmetic improvements, but I do wonder how it helps the book as a whole.  It isn't rigorous enough to deserve its name, and I doubt that anyone capable of dealing with the advanced topics would find it useful.--[[User:Wisden|Wisden]] ([[User talk:Wisden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisden|contribs]]) 09:25, 19 January 2011 (UTC)

:If in time we lose this page I won't mind.  IIRC Thenub314 was keen on the idea of a page about trig done rigorously, particularly defining 'what is an angle?', but I may be mis-remembering.  The history of this page is another matter.  It used to have an attempt at covering all of trigonometry in a very condensed way, so only introducing cos, then later presenting sin and results about sin in terms of cos.  Not the best for teaching it to someone relatively new to algebra. --[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesCrook|contribs]]) 10:30, 19 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

*criticism: just what is included under the rubric 'cognitions' is unclear; are believing angels exist and knowing one's telephone number both cognitions?  Are they the same or different?

'''''[[w:Social cognition|Social cognition]]'''''.

==Emotion and motivation==
[[image:Thought_bubble.svg|thumb|70px|right|Cognitions and motives]]

Philosophical approaches to the emotions have been around for a long time, written with explanatory depth in such writers as [[w:Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] and [[w:Jiddu Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurti]]. Social psychological approaches use these perspectives as launching points from which further theories might proceed.

===Hedonistic theory of action===
This theory finds its roots explicitly from the [[w:philosophy|philosophy]] of [[w:Epicurus|Epicurus]], followed by philosophers like [[w:John Locke|John Locke]], [[w:Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham]], and [[w:Ludwig von Mises|Ludwig von Mises]] (among many others). The hedonistic theory (or [[w:psychological hedonism|psychological hedonism]]) states that human action occurs when:
* The actor is compelled to ''increase their pleasure'' by achieving a goal, or
* The actor is compelled to ''relieve the burden of uneasiness'' by achieving a goal.

Psychological hedonism has a fundamental place in most theories of action, most notably ''[[w:behaviorism|behaviorism]]'', ''[[w:praxeology|praxeology]]'', and ''psychosocial theory''.

===Psychosocial descriptions of motivation===
[[w:Erik Erikson|Erik Erikson]] conceived of a psychosocial developmental theory as an extension of Freudian psychodynamic developmental theory. The psychosocial model, called the &quot;psycho-social theory of the self&quot;, is meant to be used to explain the most important variables in bodily development, and how they might relate to socialization. It includes:
* The ''erogenous zones'' on the body which provide stimulation. For example, the oral, anal, and phallic zones. Can also be expanded to non-erogenous zones of the body, including cerebral-cortical, loco-motor, sensory-motor, respiratory, muscular, and kinesthetic;
* The psychosexual ''mode'', or the actions associated with each zone. For example, retention and elimination for the anal zone;
* The psychosocial ''modality'', or the social analogy that can be associated with each respective mode. For example, &quot;anal-retentiveness&quot;;
* The ''meaning'', or preferred external objects associated with each mode and zone.

With this addition, Erikson made steps towards a developmental theory that was both psychological and sociological. Psychosocial theory helps to explain what kinds of ''goals'' the social actor may develop.

All of the above theories have provided models by which we might describe the subject of emotions, but more needs to be said in order for the researcher to explain and predict them. Pivotal questions include, &quot;When and why do people have feelings?&quot;, &quot;Are emotions themselves a cause of action, or are they mere [[w:epiphenomena|epiphenomena]] (or illusions)?&quot;, and &quot;How does the brain work to create social emotions?&quot;

===[[w:Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]===
===[[w:Affect control theory|Affect control theory]]===
One attempt to explain human emotional behavior has come in the form of ''affect control theory'', which states that people in a situation will try to maintain any initial feelings or impressions that they have, rather than try to change them.

===Three schools of the emotions===
There are many ways in social psychology that have been used to study emotions. There is the ''social constructionist'' approach of James Averill and Rom Harre, and the ''realist'' approach of [[w:Paul Ekman|Paul Ekman]] and his study of facial expressions. In ''cognitive emotion theories'' there are the contesting works of Lazarus and Zajonc.

Social constructionist emotion research uses cultural evidence and review of historical documents. For instance, it's hard to find a western equivalent for Japanese emotion of ''amae''. Another example often used is the emotion of ''acide'', which has disappeared from European discourse in the 15th century.

===Emotion and sequence===
The main debate in the cognitive school has been about the sequence of events. In other words, a main concern has been: ''does cognition trigger emotion or does emotion trigger cognition?''

The conventional view on this issue is that first a person will feel an emotion, and second, that emotion will compel an action.

However, Willam James's theory of the emotions says the reverse: that we first experience physical feelings in our bodies that we afterward interpret as emotions. If one sees a bear in the woods and decides to make a run for it, then one interprets oneself later on as being scared because one's heart, respiration, and feet are functioning faster. Lately Antonio Damasio has revived Willam James' emotion theory in an updated version.

James' theory of emotions can be considered physiological as well as social, for he emphasizes the situational aspects that arouse emotions. Examples William James makes use of include music, aesthetic experiences, and moral judgements. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;These [subtler emotions] are the ''moral, intellectual, and æsthetic feelings''. Concords of sounds, of colors, of lines, logical consistencies, teleological fitnesses, affect us with a pleasure that seems ingrained in the very form of the representation itself, and to borrow nothing from any reverberation surging up from the parts below the brain.[...]

A glow, a pang in the breast, a shudder, a fulness of the breathing, a flutter of the heart, a shiver down the back, a moistening of the eyes, a stirring in the hypogastrium, and a thousand unnamable symptoms besides, may be felt the moment the beauty excites us. And these symptoms also result when we are ''excited by moral perceptions, as of pathos, magnanimity, or courage''.[...]

''In all cases of intellectual or moral rapture'' we find that, unless there be coupled a bodily reverberation of some kind with the mere thought of the object and cognition of its quality; unless we actually laugh at the neatness of the ''demonstration or witticism''; unless we thrill at the case of ''justice'', or tingle at the act of magnanimity; our state of mind can hardly be called emotional at all. It is in fact a mere intellectual perception of how certain things are to be called[...]&quot; (Principle of Psychology part II, 468 - 471) all italics added &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===[[w:Spindle neuron|Spindle neuron]]s===
Recent research by [[w:John Allman|John Allman]] has suggested that a certain kind of neuron in the brain may be responsible for the social emotions of humans and primates.

===Applications===
Whatever the theory of motivation, it will likely shed some light upon broader social issues such as [[w:Alienation|Alienation]] and [[w:depressed mood|Depression]].

==Social perceptions==
The ways in which people perceive and make judgments about events in the world.

; [[w:Attribution theory|Attribution theory]] 
: This field of social psychology is concerned with the ways in which people explain (or attribute) the behavior of others. It explores how individuals &quot;attribute&quot; causes of actions either to the ''actors'' involved or to ''situations'' -- in other words, whether or not an observer judges an actor to have had control over the act and its consequences. 
:One discovery in this field is that it is normal for people to place blame upon others when some harm befalls them, but they are more likely to [[w:fundamental attribution error|blame situations when the harm is upon themselves]]. Those suffering from [[w:depression|depression]] do not seem to be susceptible to the same error.

; [[w:Social comparison theory|Social comparison theory]]
: A theory created by [[w:Leon Festinger|Leon Festinger]] which postulates that people are more likely to compare their own situations and wellbeing to that of those who they are most similar.

; [[w:Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] formation
: An area of research that inquires into the attitudes and values people come to have. One question of particular interest is, &quot;Do attitudes cause actions, or vice-versa?&quot; Two theories which argue this question are [[w:reasoned-action theory|reasoned-action theory]] (Fishbein) and [[w:self-perception theory|self-perception theory]] (Bem), respectively.

; [[w:Theory of mind|Theory of mind]] module
: Research and experimentation has recently come to suggest that part of the human mind is innately specialized in creating and processing an awareness of other minds. This &quot;module&quot; is thought to be absent for subjects with '''[[w:autism|autism]]'''.

; Pattern recognition and chaos
: Human beings have a perceptual inclination towards finding patterns out what they sense, even if what they sense is noise. This desire for pattern-making can also manifest itself in a desire for social and intellectual orderliness. However, the extent to which the perceptual inclination towards orderliness leads to social and intellectual dispositions of the same kind requires further study. It may just as well be said that human beings, in the pursuit of creative endeavors, thrive upon some degree of chaos.

; Types of [[w:belief system|belief system]]s
: Belief systems can be structured according to certain variables: systematicity, empirical relevance, adaptability to new information, tolerance of competing beliefs, degree of commitment required to maintain, and style of belief organization.

==What is social psychology?==
'''Social psychology''' is the study of how individuals perceive, influence, and relate to others. According to Gordon Allport's classic definition, social psychology is an attempt to understand and explain how the thought, feeling, and behavior of individuals is influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. By imagined or implied presence, Allport is suggesting that the effects of [[social influence]] are felt even when there are no other people about.

==Psychological and sociological emphases==
Social psychology is usually considered as subfields of [[psychology]] or [[sociology]], which concentrate on the relative importance of individual or social influences and effects respectively. Some of the differences are organizational (e.g., psychological and sociological social psychologists tend to publish in different journals) whilst other differences include the type of processes emphasized by the respective disciplines.

Psychological social psychologists tend take an interactional approach to human social behavior which emphasizes factors both within the person (cognition, affect, motives, neurophysiology, and personality traits), and the immediate social situation. Sociological social psychologists tend to emphasize processes outside of the person at a more distant macro-level, such as social structure and a more immediate micro-level, such as social interaction. Both include the use of the individual and the group as units of analysis in their research.

| '''Sociological social psychology'''
| Looks at the social behavior of humans in terms of associations and relationships that they have. This type leans toward sociology. One offshoot of this perspective is the ''Personality and Social Structure Perspective'', which emphasizes the links between individual personality and identity, and how it relates to social structures. Sociological social psychologists tend to publish in Social Psychology Quarterly. Sociological social psychologists usually are members of social psychology section of the American Sociological Association (ASA).

| '''Psychological social psychology'''
| Looks at social behavior of humans in terms of the mental states of the individuals. Psychological social psychologists tend to publish in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, and Experimental Social Psychology. Psychological social psychologists usually are members of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA).

=== Relation to other fields ===
Social psychology has close ties with the other social sciences, especially [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. It also has very strong ties to the field of social philosophy.
* ''Sociology'' is the study of group behavior and human societies, with emphasis on the structures of societies and the processes of social influence. Includes all ''organizational behavior''.
* ''Psychology'' is the study of the underlying psychological processes that make all behaviors and experiences possible. Some examples of the things it seeks to explain are: the attribution of mental states to others, the notion of a unitary 'self', sight and perception, personality and identity, warfare and violence, love, being hungry, waking up, etc.
* ''Philosophy of the social sciences'' is the study of theoretical questions about the experience and behavior of persons and the justifications involved with how they are studied in the social sciences. It involves questions related to the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of language, social epistemology, and many other fields.

== History ==
The discipline of social psychology began at the dawn of the twentieth century. Landmark moments include the publication of Charles Horton Cooley's &quot;Human Nature and Social Order&quot; in 1902, which sought to explain the social order by use of the concept of a looking-glass self. The first textbooks in social psychology would be published six years later by E. A. Ross and William McDougall.

John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte and others laid the foundation for social psychology by asserting that human social cognition and behavior could and should be studied scientifically like any other natural science.

== The concerns of social psychology ==
=== General research interests ===
[[image:soc-psy_diagram.jpg|150px|right|Social Psychology Diagram]]
Social psychology attempts to understand the relationship between minds, groups, and behaviors in three general ways.

First, it tries to see how the thoughts, feelings and behaviors of '''individuals''' are ''influenced'' by the '''actual, imagined, or implied presence of other(s)''' (Allport 3).  This includes social perception, social interaction, and the many kinds of social influence (like trust, power, and persuasion). Gaining insight into the social psychology of persons involves looking at the influences that individuals have on the ''beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors'' of other individuals, as well as the influence that ''groups'' have on individuals. This aspect of social psychology asks questions like:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: #C7E1F5; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
* How do small group dynamics impact cognition and emotional states?
* How do social groups control or contribute to behavior, emotion, or attitudes of the individual members?
* How does the group impact the individual?
* How does the individual operate within the social group?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, it tries to understand the influence that '''individual perceptions and behaviors have upon the behavior of groups'''. This includes looking at things like ''group productivity in the workplace'' and ''group decision making''. It looks at questions like:
* How does persuasion work to change group behavior, emotion or attitudes?
* What are the reasons behind conformity, diversity, and deviance?

Third, and finally, social psychology tries to understand '''groups themselves as behavioral entities''', and the relationships and influences that one group has upon another group (Michener 5). It asks questions like:

* What makes some groups hostile to one another, and others neutral or civil?
* Do groups behave in a different way than an individual outside the group?

In European textbooks there is also fourth level called the &quot;ideological&quot; level. It studies the societal forces that influence the human psyche.

=== Underlying issues ===
In social psychology, as in any other discipline, there will be a number of underlying philosophical predispositions in the projects of scientists. Some of these predispositions involve the nature of social knowledge itself, the nature of social reality, and the locus of human control in action (Cote and Levine, 2002; Slife and Gantt, 1999).
	
One main and lasting crisis has been the debate over positivism and phenomenology. In the former, the research focus has been an attempt to find overarching, universal laws to social behavior and history. In the latter, by contrast, the emphasis is upon a focus of empirical study, and making accurate descriptions of social reality, regardless of whether or not they fit a grand theory or explanation. These two forms have tended to lend themselves to favor either quantitative or qualitative methods, respectively. In addition to these two orientations, there is a third outlook: a kind of social rationalism, which makes use of axiomatic presuppositions in order to explain social reality.

One underlying problem for the social psychologists is whether or not their studies can or should ultimately be understood in terms of the meaning and consciousness behind social action, as with folk psychology, or whether or not more objective materialist and behavioral facts are to be given exclusive study. This problem is especially important for those within social psychology who study meaning and language, and for those in the sociological social psychology tradition who favor symbolic interactionism, because a rejection of the study of meanings would lead to the reclassification of such research as unempirical.

Three persistent themes in the philosophy of the social sciences, and which directly affect social psychology, have been the '''structure-agency debate''', and the related arguments over determinism and free will. 

First, especially important among sociological social psychologists, the structure-agency debate (sometimes referred to by the terms &quot;individualism&quot; and &quot;holism&quot;) involves questions about the nature of social behavior: whether it is ultimately predictable in terms of the creative volition of the individual, or is largely a product of socialization, interaction, and greater social structures. (Bunnin and Tsui-James, 2003) 

The concern over free will has often been posed as philosophical and methodological, and not empirical, usually in the tradition of incompatibilism. However, some compatibilists see the issue as itself being something which can be investigated empirically by social psychologists. The work of Benjamin Libet is one example of research that has been taken to be an empirical refutation of the notion of free will.

=== Research ethics ===

Social psychologists are concerned with ethical issues, and there are certain ethical controversies that are especially apparent in this area. The goal of social psychology is to understand naturally occurring cognition and behavior in a social context, but the very act of observing people in social contexts tends to influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize '''deception''' to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on. This practice has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is not ethically correct, and that other research strategies (e.g. role-playing) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g. the Milgram experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.

To protect the rights and wellbeing of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or institutional review board. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is done to the participants, and that the benefits of the study outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study. Furthermore, a process of '''informed consent''' is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A '''debriefing''' is typically done at the conclusion of the experiment in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected as by routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.

&quot;go to materials (f5) and select the default material&quot; ??? there seems to be no button that says that or anyting. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 02:14, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

I am using v2.37 and I cannot seem to get any materials or textures to take even at rendering!,
this is very frustrating as I have made several attempts with several tutorials what am I doing wrong?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{stub}}

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for find prime numbers that is attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes.  The idea is to begin by listing all the natural numbers bigger than 2.
:&lt;math&gt;2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 \ldots&lt;/math&gt; 
and beginning with 2 we go to the first number that as not been crossed off and cross every multiple of that number that is later on in the list.

So in the case of 2, no numbers have been crossed so we start by removing every second number after 2.  Our list would then look like
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \cancel{4}, 5, \cancel{6}, 7, \cancel{8}, 9, \cancel{10}, 11, \cancel{12}, 13, \cancel{14}, 15, \cancel{16}, 17, \cancel{18}, 19, \cancel{20}, 21, \cancel{22}, 23, \cancel{24}\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
And we keep applying our rule.  Here our next number not crossed out will be 3, we cross out every third number after 3.  That will be 6, 9, 12,…  and our list the becomes
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \cancel{4}, 5, \cancel{6}, 7, \cancel{8}, \cancel{9}, \cancel{10}, 11, \cancel{12}, 13, \cancel{14}, \cancel{15}, \cancel{16}, 17, \cancel{18}, 19, \cancel{20}, \cancel{21}, \cancel{22}, 23, \cancel{24} \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
And so on.  At the end only the prime numbers will be left.  

In this case we have already found all of the primes less than 25.  This is because composite numbers must always have a prime factor less than their square root.  If this were not the case for some integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we could write &lt;math&gt;n=p_1\times p_2\times\cdots\times p_k&lt;/math&gt;.  Since we are assuming &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is composite we know there are at least two prime factors &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;.  If both of which are greater than &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p_1\times p_2 &gt; \sqrt{n}\times \sqrt{n}=n&lt;/math&gt;.  This would contradict that &lt;math&gt;n=p_1\times p_2\times\cdots\times p_k&lt;/math&gt;.  So for us, since we have crossed out every number with a factor smaller than 5 we have crossed out every composite number less than &lt;math&gt;5^2=25&lt;/math&gt;.

== Tutorial Authors Wanted on Official Blender MediaWiki! ==

The main Blender documentation and tutorial authors are now working on the [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Official Blender MediaWiki]. If you're considering helping write Blender tutorials or documentation, please consider helping us at the official wiki instead.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

== Wanted! ==

* [[Blender 3D: The Gimp for the Blender]] &amp;mdash; texture creation using the Gimp
* Wouldn't it be nice with a big fat, always updated Blender reference book. The current hotkey reference should be merged into it. Maybe it's ok just to copy the [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlII/ official reference] for a start? [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlII/a11911.html#appendix_licenses_ocl (Open Content License)].
** Starting a [[Blender 3D: Reference Guide|Blender Reference]] book :) Hope this could be the one doc in what the developers edit changes.

== Namespacing ==

How we will now name modules? Like ''Blender 3D: ModuleName'' or ''Blender 3D/ModuleName''? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 16:14, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I think the better way to do it is &quot;Blender 3D: ModuleName&quot;.  This way the module can better be a stand-alone book.  What do you think?  --[[User:68.3.31.10|68.3.31.10]] 14:43, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Yes I agree. Who changed this anyway? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 11:04, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: From history was [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]]: (:s to /s. this naming scheme creates automatic back links to the top of the articles.) --[[User:Popski|Popski]]

With this few changes [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] just messed with redirections and there is no more history. C'mon!! If you start to make changes like this then do it right and please discuss first. You can use some Sandbox for such testings. This automatic back links are totally unimportant anyway, I'll put it back. -[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:58, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for doing that, Popski.  Hopefully I'll be able to get back onto this Blender book here in a week or so when I'm done with this terrible class I'm in, give you some help.  [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] was trying to help, but I don't think that this particular contribution was beneficial.  Just so everybody remembers, he has in the past contributed in a positive way many times, so it's all good. Popski, we need to get the templated keyboard shortcuts book going, I'll spend time on it in about a week, the templates will be very helpful for integration with the other blender books.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 04:56, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I know that he didn't want to make any harm, but why people don't say anything before doing such things? You'll be back in a week? Well, that's good news! :) Blender 2.37 have some new ShortCuts (need to add). Another good news is that is '''[http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40007&amp;start=15 Varuag]''' interested to have his !great tutorials here! Unfortunatly is his homepage as down as is www.blenderman.org :( What do you think [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] where to put such tutorials as are his car tutorials? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 21:24, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: Sweet!  Good job Popski!  We should probably put Varuag's tutorials up under the Intermediate Modeling/Mechanical Modeling section.  I haven't seen Varuag's stuff myself but I'm assuming it's pretty awesome.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:03, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Drawing from life ==

&quot;Drawing from life&quot; is the act of drawing what you see.  Life drawing is considered fundamental to most other types of art because it teaches the student to observe all aspects of their subject.  Life drawing is also easier to evaluate than more abstract art: If the student intends to draw a subject from life, then their artwork can be evaluated as how well it directly resembles the subject.

=== The mental process ===

The brain's visual system is large and complex, designed to reduce an image directly to a concept so that the person can then act on that concept.  While this process is useful for daily functioning and general survival, it actually impedes the process of drawing from life.  For example, here is the process that an untrained person might go through while drawing part of a face:

# The eye sees the subject's nose.
# The visual system reduces the image to the concept &quot;nose&quot;.
# The mind thinks, &quot;What do I know about a nose?  Noses have two nostrils.  Nostrils look round.&quot;
# The hand draws two circles.

Thus, instead of drawing the shapes of the nose that the artist sees, the artist draws a mental icon for &quot;nose&quot;, despite the fact that from most angles nostrils are not circular -- from many angles one nostril may even be totally obscured, but that won't stop the untrained artist from drawing it.  While there is artistic value in being able to identify and reproduce mental icons, the process is not helpful when learning to draw from life.

In learning to draw from life, artists learn to ignore the conceptual aspects of their subjects so that they can concentrate on the visual details.  Thus, life drawing skills are usually taught through a series of exercises that emphasize visual details while obscuring the whole.

=== Exercises ===

==== Copying an image using a grid ====

Drawing an image using a grid is a venerable technique for transferring a small drawing to a large surface such as an over-sized canvas or a wall. The technique itself is simple: divide the original small drawing into equal sections using lightly-ruled lines, and then create the exact same grid in larger proportion on the target surface. Afterward, transfer the drawing to the new surface section by section.

==== Copying an upside-down image ====

This process helps in training oneself to draw what you see, not what you would normally characterize something as. For example, if you were drawing a nose upside down and did not know you were drawing a nose, your mental concept of a nose would be suppressed, allowing you to draw more accurately and train yourself to look at the lines and shapes of what you're drawing.

==== Blind contour drawings ====

This involves choosing an object and drawing it without looking even once at your paper. This develops hand-eye coordination which helps in accurately depicting what you're trying to draw. For beginning artists, this exercise isn't concentrated on achieving a perfect likeness of whatever you're drawing, just draw what you see and don't worry about what it looks like. If you keep doing this, over time your hand-eye coordination will improve immensely and you will begin to be able to draw what you see accurately without even looking.

Introductory Exercise: Pierce a paper plate with a sharp pencil. (If you don't have a paper plate handy, any kind of stiff paper will do.) Put the plate over the top of your pencil, resting atop your hand, so that it blocks your view of your drawing paper. Draw any convenient object, perhaps your shoe, a set of keys, or items from the kitchen. The barrier makes it impossible for your drawing to come out &quot;right,&quot; which takes a lot of pressure off you as you gradually learn to see in a new way. Each time you practice, your brain will be making new connections between your eyes and drawing muscles, much as happened when you learned to ride a bike without thinking much about the bike. When you finish a drawing, you'll probably find it more humorous than accurate. Enjoy that, but also look for places where your line was fairly accurate. Later, you may find this a good way to loosen up before tackling your project for the day.

Advanced Exercise (from [The Animation Learner's Site]): Find a place where you can work undisturbed for half an hour. Place your sketch book open on a table on your right hand side, preferably tilted towards you. Hold your pencil lightly in your right hand, and place it roughly in the middle of your paper. Now, turn in your chair until you are looking in the opposite direction of your paper. Your right hand, the pencil and the paper are now behind you. Place your left hand on your knee and relax. VERY SLOWLY, start to trace the contours of your hand. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES LOOK AT YOUR PAPER! Draw everything you see. Do not attempt to name something (like a fingernail) and then draw it, because you cannot see the paper you are drawing it onto. Just &quot;trace,&quot; as accurately as you can, the contours of that thing (which just so happens to be a fingernail). You should start by drawing for about 15 minutes at a time (use a timer!), and gradually work up to anywhere from 1/2 hour to 2 hours per hand. After you have been doing this exercise for several weeks, you may look at the paper occasionally to reposition your pencil. But do not move the pencil until you are again looking away.

==== Gesture drawings ====

In figure drawing, a gesture drawing is a very fast sketch--one or two lines at most--describing the primary motion or position of the body. A series of gesture drawings are usually sketched out in rapid succession as a warm-up prior to the start of a figure drawing class or session.

A gesture drawing does not show the surface details of an object, rather the forces that are contained within that object. Like contour drawing, it involves an almost complete loss of conscious thought and allows you simply to react to what you see. (from [The Animation Learner's Site])

Exercise (also from [The Animation Learner's Site]): Take any complicated object. A live model (clothed or nude) is best, but a flower, plant, pet, ribbon, or any other organically shaped object should do fine. (I would not recommend using your hand this time, as gesture drawing is very physical and involves the whole upper body and you will not be able to keep your hand still). Set your timer to 15 seconds. Yup, you heard right. You've got 15 seconds to draw the object in front of you. After the time is up, move the object or get the model to change poses. Repeat a minimum of ten times. Now set your timer to 30 seconds and repeat 5-10 times. Now set it to two minutes and repeat about five-ten times. Note that your drawing speed should NOT CHANGE; when you have 2 minutes you should draw like you have fifteen seconds.

==== Breaking images into shapes ====

The basis of all realistic drawing technique is solid geometry. One who draws well has an aptitude for conceiving an object as an inter-relation of component geometric solids. For example, a human leg may be conceived as a composite of rectangular shapes, or it may be conceived as a series of ovoid shapes--or a combination of the two. The choice the artist makes contributes to what is ultimately known as his or her ''style''.

==== Drawing using negative space ====

Do not try to draw the shape of the ball, draw the negative space around it.

==== Proportion through measurement ====

When rendering an object, an artist is in a constant state of analysis. Every object exists in relation to an adjacent object.

==== Drawing a ball ====

The seemingly simple exercise of drawing a ball so that it appears to be three-dimensional permits you to analyze and solve virtually every lighting analysis problem you will encounter when trying to render a figure realistically.

[[Image:Kiwi aka.jpg|thumb|right|200px|kiwifruit]]

The '''kiwifruit''' (or '''kiwi'''&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that to a New Zealander, the kiwi is the flightless and endangered national bird. So, it is best to avoid talking about eating a kiwi with them. Also, kiwi is used as a general term for a New Zealander, that is another reason why they call the fruit the kiwifruit instead.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. It is the size of a large hens [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], and a is grown only in temperate climates. Kiwifruit flesh is said to taste and feel vaguely like strawberries, but with a strong green taste. When canned, kiwifruit become mushy and lose their color.

Raw kiwifruit is also rich in the protein-dissolving enzyme actinidin, which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer but can be an allergen for some individuals. Specifically, people allergic to papayas or pineapples are likely to be allergic to kiwifruit also.

This enzyme, which is quickly destroyed by boiling the fruit, makes raw kiwifruit unfit for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products. The enzyme will start to dissolve the milk proteins within a few minutes, leaving a very unpleasant bitter taste. However, sliced kiwifruit may be used as a garnish atop whipped cream as on one of New Zealand's favourite desserts, the [[Cookbook:Pavlova|pavlova]], without ill effects.

[[Image:Grappe_de_figues_2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of [[fig]]s on a [[fig tree]]]]

The '''fig''' is a fruit. Though exquisite when fresh and ripe, it spoils far too quickly to make fresh fruit practical. Figs are usually available in dried form. There are two main types of fig, the small dark ones (mission figs) and the large pale ones (all others: calimyrna, kadota, brown turkey, etc.). Most dried figs are mission figs, but the other types generally taste a little better.

The fig is actually a flower inverted into itself, sometimes needing to be polinated by a wasp that crawls inside through the bottom hole.

Figs are highly nutritious. One serving of figs is 40 [[Cookbook:g|grams]], about ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], or about 3 Calimyrna figs or about 4 to 5 Mission figs. Figs are high in [[Cookbook:Fiber|fiber]], providing 20% of the Daily Value — more dietary fiber per serving than any other common dried or fresh fruit.

==Availability, selection, and storage==
Fresh figs are available July through September. Dried figs are never out of season, and are available all year. You can find them in your favorite grocery store in the produce or dried fruit section. Look for fresh figs that are soft and smell sweet. Handle carefully because their fragile skins bruise easily. You can store fully ripened figs in the refrigerator up to 2 days, assuming the store didn't already do so. Bring the figs to room temperature before serving.

The '''peach''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]]. Peach flesh tastes and feels somewhat like [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]] flesh. Freestone peaches have flesh that separates easily from the pit. Cling peaches have flesh that clings to the pit. Cling peaches taste a bit better, but might not be worth the trouble. Peaches are fuzzy on the outside; some people will want to peel off the skin.

Choose peaches with a strong and pleasant smell. Peaches will soften if left around, but will not gain a nice ripe taste and smell. Do not refrigerate peaches.

[[Image:Apricots.jpg|thumb|right|200px|apricot]]

The '''apricot''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]]. Apricots have loose pits that are fairly smooth. Apricots are plum-sized at most, sometimes smaller.

Apricots do not keep well. Most apricots are picked while very unripe, and never develop much apricot flavor. When ripe, an apricot is very soft but not mushy. Apricots are easy to bruise. Do not refrigerate apricots.

Apricots are commonly used in [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]].

To cut an apricot, slice around its seam, twist it in half, and lift out the pit. Be gentle.

When fresh apricots aren't in season, dried apricots are often available. Choose brown ones (without [[Cookbook:Sulfur Dioxide|sulfur dioxide]]) if you can find them. Choose tough chewy ones over soft ones. Soft ones have a less intense flavor, more water, and often added glycerin.

Freeze-dried apricots are crunchy and extremely sweet.

==Seasonality==

{{Seasonality|Apricots|1|1|1|1|3|3|3|2|2|1|1|1}}
The peak season for apricots falls in in the early summer (May through July on the northern hemisphere). [http://www.cookinglight.com/cooking/fd/features/article/0,13803,228653,00.html][http://www.produceoasis.com/TipOTDay_folder/Tips_folder/Jul15tip.html]

In North America, Apricots are available throughout the year from different regions:
* Mid-February through mid-March from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]]
* Mid-June through mid-July from [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]
* Mid-July through mid-August from Washington

[[Image:Bananas.svg|thumb|right|200px|bananas]]

The '''banana''' is a mildly sweet tropical fruit related to the starchy [[Cookbook:Plantain|plantain]].

Bananas are always picked green. When green, they have a &quot;green&quot; taste somewhat like [[Cookbook:Kiwifruit|kiwifruit]]. Banana ripening is triggered by ethylene gas, and causes the release of ethylene gas. Most types of fruit will ripen when placed in a bag with ripening bananas. As bananas ripen, they turn yellow and then get brown spots that eventually merge to make the banana completely dark brown. A banana is generally best from immediately after the spots appear until the spots begin to merge, but this is a matter of personal preference.  Firm is better for eating out of hand or in fresh fruit recipes, softer and riper is generally better for baking.

Bananas are very easy to bruise. Bruises will make a banana brown and mushy on the inside.

Refrigeration causes the outside of the peel to turn dark prematurely.  Frozen bananas can be eaten as a treat (coated in chocolate), or defrosted for baking.

Dried banana chips are often available. Choose brown ones (without [[Cookbook:Sulfur Dioxide|sulfur dioxide]]) if you can find them.

The banana is a rich source of potassium. The banana helps prevent both constipation and diarrhoea.

Bananas are relatively high in calories (a medium-sized banana has about 110 calories).  But they are a nutrient-dense food, contributing to a healthy diet by providing not only potassium but also calcium, carotene, vitamin C, vitamin B6, etc.

If substitution is desired, use [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|pawpaws]] instead of bananas. Pawpaws are generally more nutritious than bananas.

Green bananas can be used as a vegetable, and cooked by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]].

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Banana|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3}}
Bananas are a typical non-seasonal fruit, which means they are available fresh all year. They are usually grown in tropical countries.

[[Image:Ananas pflanze.jpg|thumb|right|200px|pineapple]]

The '''pineapple''' is a very sweet tropical fruit. It can be up to 1 foot tall. Pineapple is commonly eaten fresh, in desserts, or cooked as part of a sauce or glaze.

When buying fresh pineapple, choose a good-smelling fruit that feels solid. The topmost leaves should be a bit loose (meaning ripe) and not browning (meaning too old). There should not be a yeasty smell at the bottom.

When buying canned pineapple, choose pineapple packed in juice. Name-brand pineapple is sweeter, and thus better suited for eating without added sugar. The cheaper store-brand pineapple is fine for baking.

==Carving a fresh pineapple==
#Twist out the top. The top may be planted if you want a 4' (1.2[[Cookbook:m|m]]) diameter thorny bush that requires a couple years of frost-free weather. You'd also get a tall stalk, covered in lovely blue flowers, that turns into a pineapple.
#Slice away the skin. The best tasting pineapple is right under the surface, so don't cut too deeply.
#Carve out the &quot;eyes&quot;. These flower holes contain enzymes that can cause mouth irritation; they digest ''you'' a little bit. (pineapples can get revenge)
#Slice the pineapple the long way. Make 6 to 12 (8 is easy) wedges with the core along one edge of each wedge.
#Cut the core away from each wedge.
#Chop up the wedges as desired. The bottom part is sweetest and most likely to be spoiled.

== Seasonality ==

{{Seasonality|Pineapple|1|1|2|3|3|2|1|1|1|1|1|1}}

Pineapples have their peak season near the end of spring. In some locations, like Hawaii, they are available all year round.

[[Image:Papaya.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Papayas]]                    
[[Image:Carica_papaya_-_papaya_-_var-tropical_dwarf_papaya_-_desc-fruit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Papayas]]                    

The '''papaya''' is a [[Cookbook:Melon|melon]]-like tropical [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] with yellow-orange flesh enclosed in a thin skin that varies in color from green to orange to rose.

The papaya contains an enzyme called papain that is a meat tenderizer. It breaks down tough meat fibers. It is sold as a component in powdered meat tenderizer available in most supermarkets. Some people react badly to this when eating papaya.

==Selection==
Look for papayas that are partly or completely yellow in color, depending on variety, that give slightly to pressure, but are not soft at the stem-end. Avoid papayas that are bruised, shriveled, or have soft areas. Papayas that are hard and green are immature and will not ripen properly. Uncut papayas have no smell. Papayas that are cut should smell sweet, not bad or fermented.

==Storage==
Slightly green papayas will ripen quickly at room temperature, especially if placed in a paper bag. As the papaya ripens, it will turn from green to yellow. Place ripe papayas in a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator. Papayas will keep for up to a week, but it's best to use them within a day or two.

==Varieties==
There are two types of papayas, the Hawaiian and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]]. The Hawaiian varieties, also known as Solo papayas, are found most often in supermarkets. These fruits are pear-shaped, weigh about a [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] each, and have yellow skin when ripe. The flesh is bright orange or pinkish, depending on the variety. The Mexican varieties are not as common but can be found in Latino supermarkets. Mexican papayas are much larger then the Hawaiian types and can weigh up to 20 pounds and be more than 15 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long. Although the flavor is less intense than the Hawaiian varieties, they are still delicious and enjoyable.</text>

[[Image:PersimmonPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|Hachiya Persimmon]]                    
[[Image:Fuyu_persimmon.jpg|thumb|left|Fuyu Persimmon]]
The '''persimmon''' is a fruit that has fallen out of fashion for its poor keeping qualities. There are two main types, the tall ''Hachiya'' type and the short squat ''Fuyu'' type. Choose persimmons that are very soft but not mushy, and be very careful not to bruise them.

Although there are countless different varieties of persimmons, only two are commercially available. There are distinguishable by their shape.

*'''Hachiya:''' This type of persimmon makes up approximately 90 percent of the available fruit. It is identifiable by its acorn like shape. This persimmon is tart until it becomes soft ripe.

*'''Fuyu:''' This persimmon is gaining popularity here as it is in Japan. Similar in color, but looking like a squashed tomato, this variety is smaller, sweeter, and is edible while still firm.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
==Availability, Selection, Storage, Preparation==
Persimmons are widely available September through December, with a peak during November.

Choose persimmons with deep red undertones. Look for persimmons that are round, plump, and have glossy and smooth skin. Avoid fruits with blemishes, bruises or cracked skin and missing the green leaves at the top. Select ripe persimmons only if you plan to eat them immediately. Otherwise, buy firmer fruits and allow them to ripen.

Ripen persimmons at room temperature in a paper bag with an apple or banana. Store them in the refrigerator when ripe. Be sure to eat the fruit as soon as possible because overripe persimmons quickly turn to a mushy texture.

Ripe Fuyu persimmons, which look kind of like flattened tomatoes, will be crisp, while the acorn-shaped Hachiyas will be very soft and juicy.

Unripe Hachiya persimmons taste very bitter and will suck all the moisture from your mouth — not very pleasant. The tartness will go away as the fruit ripens.</text>

[[Image:Plums hanging.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plums on the tree]]
[[Image:Plums in basket.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plums in a basket]]
The '''plum''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]].

Choose plums with a pleasant smell. It's common for plums to develop a yeast growth on the surface, like grapes. Plums will soften if left around, but will not gain a nice ripe taste and smell, like other fruits. They benefit more than most fruits from being picked when absolutely ripe, but before the wasps get them, and plums sold in supermarkets tend to have been picked too early, which means they suffer less damage in transit, but never develop the full taste and fragrance. 

When chopped up and boiled down with sugar, plums make an excellent topping for [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]].

Plums can also be used very effectively with [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]]. Try using a purée flavoured with [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]] and [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]].

Dried plums are called prunes.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Plum|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|2|1|1|1|1}}
Plums are a typical summer fruit. Early-season varieties will start halfway through May (in the northern hemisphere), whereas later season varieties will be harvested until the third week of August. Some late varieties keep well enough to last until late November. [http://www.producepete.com/shows/plums.html]

The '''strawberry''' is a small sweet fruit.

Choose red strawberries, being careful to avoid any signs of rot. Rotting strawberries tend to have mushy spots that may be discolored and sunken, often turning a bit violet or lavender. Unripe strawberries tend to be pale, sometimes almost white.

When chopped up and boiled down with sugar, strawberries make a good topping for [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]].

Strawberries are often served on [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] or shortcake with a topping of [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Links to Retailers==
I added a couple of links to places where mason bees could be purchased. I am in no way affiliated with these retailers. I simply added them as a convenience, as mason bees are not necessarily the easiest thing to find for sale. I also want to mention that I have not purchased bees from either of these places, and don’t guarantee the quality of their stock. Rather I built a mason bee house (the one pictured in the module) and was lucky enough to have a few feral ones move in on their own (one of the residents is also pictured on the module).
--[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 04:22, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)

==Request for regional info==
From the mason bee article I found out mason bees are native to Japan and North America. I was wondering if the info on the page could be similarly used for similar bees found in Europe (if any)? --[[User:Egregius|Egregius]] ([[User talk:Egregius|talk]]) 21:26, 11 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

This is a classically inspired steak recipe, with influences from both [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] and [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European cuisine]].

==Ingredients==

* Two 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] [[Cookbook:Beef|sirloin steaks]]
* [[cookbook:Montreal Steak Seasoning|Montreal steak seasoning]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Wine|Cabernet Sauvignon]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* 8-10 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* ⅓ large white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 cloves [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 2 tbsp extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Dice the onion, shallots and garlic. Set these aside. 
# Pre-heat a medium-sized [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] to low-medium heat and pre-heat the barbecue to high.
# Throw the onions in the pan and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until light yellow. 
# Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sauté for a few minutes more. Make sure all ingredients are lightly crisped.
# Pour in about ⅓ of the wine and ⅓ of the vinegar. Let this simmer and reduce at a lower heat for about 5-10 minutes.
# Place the steaks on the [[Cookbook:Barbecue|barbecue]], seasoning with the Montreal steak spice.
# Add the rest of the wine and vinegar and season by sprinkling some fresh black pepper on top. Boil off until you no longer smell the alcohol coming from the steaming wine.
# Flip the steaks. You want them to be soft on the inside (cooked rare) yet quite charred on the outside, to get that charcoal flavor.
# Once the sauce has gone down to about ⅓ of its original volume, take off heat.
# Remove steaks from grill and take inside.

Place the steaks on your plates, cover with the sauce and serve!

You may wish to serve this flavourful dish with a side that compliments its strong flavors such as [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], new [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], or roasted [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]].

Serves two people.

==How to Skin and Roast Hazelnuts==

# Add 3 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] (sodium bicarbonate) to 2 cups boiling water; 
# Add the nuts and blanch for 10 minutes. The baking soda neutralizes the acid skins, which can then be removed easily.
#Drain the nuts in a sieve and rinse with cold water.
#Place the nuts in a container of cold water.
#Remove the skins under running water and place peeled nuts in the sieve over a container.
#When all the nuts are peeled, dry them off by patting handfuls in paper towels.
#Salt the nuts to taste while still damp (optional). 
#To roast the hazelnuts, place skinned nuts on a baking sheet in a 275ºF oven for  20 - 30 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes.

To help slough off the skins after the hot and cold water process, rub between terry towels.

Crawfish can be found in muddy holes on the edge of a stream or pond, either above or below the waterline. They can pinch quite well.

Crawfish are usually [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] whole, often with boil seasoning in the water.
Most of the meat is in the tail and head, but some meat may be sucked out of the claws.

[[Image:Emmentaler.jpg|right|thumb|Emmental]]

'''Emmental''', or ''Emmentaler'', is the cheese widely known as ''Swiss cheese'' in [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North America]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. It is a yellow, medium-hard cheese with a mildly tangy flavour from lactic acid fermentation. It is characterised by large holes left by gas bubbles produced during fermentation of the cheese.

Much of the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; produced under that name, and not designated Emmentaler, is in fact a processed cheese that is not made to the traditional Emmentaler process.</text>

The '''almond''' comes from the pit of a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]]. Bitter almonds, and the seeds of the related fruits, contain high levels of the poison cyanide. Normal almonds are safe to eat.

To remove the brown peels, [[cookbook:blanch|blanch]] the almonds (briefly plunge them into boiling water) and then put them in cold water. The peels will become loose enough to slip off.

Almonds go well with [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]], [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], or [[Cookbook:White Mountain Frosting|white mountain frosting]].

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Almonds|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|1|1}}
Almonds have their peak in mid-summer and stay in season throughout the fall.

Roast and packaged almonds will be available regardless of season, and fresh unprocessed almonds may be hard to find, even in season.

{{spice}}

'''Asafoetida''' (''Ferula asafoetida''), is a dark amber resin which comes from the dried sap from the stem and roots of this wild fennel. The most commonly available form is '''compounded asafoetida''', a fine powder containing 30% asafoetida resin, along with [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Gum arabic|gum arabic]]. It is mainly grown in Iran, Afghanistan, and Kashmir.

This spice is used as a digestive aid and in pickles. Its odour is so strong that it must be stored in airtight containers; otherwise, it spoils other foodstuffs. It loses its smell in cooking, however, and presents an [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]-like taste. In India, it is used especially by the Brahmin caste of the Hindus and by adherents of Jainism, who are not allowed to eat onions.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Haskell Basics}}

So far this tutorial has discussed functions that return values, but how do something basic like write &quot;Hello world&quot;? Simple:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Prelude&gt; putStrLn &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; is one of the standard Prelude functions. As the &quot;putStr&quot; part of the name suggests, it takes a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; as an argument and prints it to the screen. The &quot;Ln&quot; indicates it also prints a line break, so that whatever else is printed next will appear on a new line.

So now you should be thinking, &quot;what is the type of the putStrLn function?&quot; It takes a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and gives… um… what? What do we call that? The program doesn't get something back that it can use in another function. Instead, the result involves having the computer change the screen. In other words, it does something in the world outside of the program. What type could that have? Let's see what GHCi tell us:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t putStrLn
putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;IO&quot; stands for &quot;input and output&quot;. Wherever there is &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in a type, interaction with the world outside the program is involved. We'll call &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; values, such as the result of &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;, ''actions''. The other part of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; type, in this case &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, is the type of the return value of the action; that is, the type of what it gives back to the program (as opposed to what it does outside the program). &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; (read as &quot;unit&quot;) is an uninteresting type with just a single value, also called &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; sends output to the world but doesn't return anything to the program, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; is used as a placeholder. We might read &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;action which returns &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, just like we read &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;list of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; elements&quot;.

Here are just a few examples of when we need to use IO:

*  print a string to the screen
*  read a string from a keyboard
*  write data to a file
*  read data from a file

What makes IO actually work? Lots of things happen behind the scenes to take us from a &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; to pixels in the screen; however, we don't have to worry about them right now. What we have to know is that a complete Haskell program is actually a big IO action that is run when the program is executed. In a compiled program, this action is called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, and has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;. From this point of view, to write a Haskell program is to combine actions and functions to form the overall function &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; that will be executed when the program is run.

== Sequencing actions with ''do'' ==

'''do''' notation provides a convenient means of putting actions together, which is essential in getting useful things done with Haskell. Let's see what it looks like by considering a more complex program:

{{HaskellExample|1=What is your name?|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

{{body note|1=
Even though &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation looks very different from the Haskell code we have seen so far, it is just syntactic sugar for a handful of functions, the most important of them being the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; operator. Ideally, we would explain how those functions work and then introduce &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. However, there are a number of topics we need to go through before we can give a convincing explanation, notably higher order functions and type classes. Jumping in with &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; right now is a pragmatic short cut that will allow you to start writing complete programs with IO right now. We will see why &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; works later in the book, beginning with the [[../Understanding monads/]] chapter. 
}}

Before we get into how ''do'' works, take a look at &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;. It goes to the outside world, in this case to the terminal, and brings back a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; from it. What is its type?

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t getLine
getLine :: IO String
&lt;/source&gt;

That means &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; is an IO action that, when run, will return a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. But what about the input? While functions have types like &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; which reflect that they take arguments and give back results, &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; doesn't actually take an argument. It takes as input whatever is in the line in the terminal. However, that line in the outside world can't be a value with a type because it isn't even in Haskell yet! The Haskell program can't know in advance what it will be, and indeed the value could be different every time.

As there is no way to predict the exact results of IO actions (since the program doesn't know the state of the outside world until runtime), they have to be executed in a predictable sequence defined in advance in our code. With regular functions that do not perform IO, the exact sequencing of execution is less of a concern as long as the results eventually go to the right places.

In our name program, we're sequencing three actions: a &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; with a greeting, a &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; and another &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;. With the &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;, we use &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; notation, which is a way to get the return value out
of an action, so that we can use it elsewhere (in this case, to prepare the final message being printed). The final action defines the type of the whole &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block and, in this case, of the program. Here, the final action is the result of a &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;, and so it has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Exercises|1=
Write a program which asks the user for the base and height of a
right angled triangle, calculates its area and prints it to the screen.  The
interaction should look something like:
&lt;pre&gt;
The base?
3.3
The height?
5.4
The area of that triangle is 8.91
&lt;/pre&gt;
Hint: you can use the function &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; to convert user strings like &quot;3.3&quot; into numbers like 3.3 and function &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to convert a number into string.
}}

=== Left arrow clarifications ===

While actions like &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; are almost always used to get values, we are not obliged to actually get them.  For example, we could very well have written something like this:

{{HaskellExample|1=executing &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; directly|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Clearly, that isn't very useful: the whole point of prompting the user for his or her name was so that we could do something with the result. That being said, it is conceivable that one might wish to read a line
and completely ignore the result. In real life, we often get someone's name when meeting them and then promptly forget it even though we keep talking… By omitting the &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;, the action will happen, but the data won't be stored anywhere.

It's nicer to actually remember someone's name, of course. So, in order to get the value out of the action, we write &lt;code&gt;name &lt;- getLine&lt;/code&gt;, which basically means &quot;run &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;, and put the results in the variable called &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.&quot;

==== &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; can be used with any action except the last ====

There are very few restrictions on which actions can have values
obtained from them.  Consider the following example, where we put the
results of each action into a variable (except the last...  more on that
later):

{{HaskellExample|1=putting all results into a variable|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  x &lt;- putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; gets the value out
of its action, but that isn't useful in this case because
the action returns the unit value &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.  So while we could technically get the value out
of any action, it isn't always worth it.

So, what about that last action?  Why can't we get a value out of that?  Let's see what happens
when we try:

{{HaskellExample|1=getting the value out of the last action|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  x &lt;- putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  y &lt;- putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Whoops! Error!
{{HaskellGHCi|1=
HaskellWikibook.hs:5:2:
    The last statement in a 'do' construct must be an expression
}}
}}

This is a much more interesting example, but it requires a somewhat
deeper understanding of Haskell than we currently have.  Suffice it to
say, whenever you use &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; to get the value of an action,
Haskell is always expecting another action to follow it.  So the very
last action better not have any &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;s.

=== Controlling actions ===

Normal Haskell constructions like &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt;
can be used within the &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt; notation, but you need to be somewhat
careful.  For instance, in a simple &quot;guess the number&quot; program, we have:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
   putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
   guess &lt;- getLine
   if (read guess) &lt; num
     then do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
     else if (read guess) &gt; num
            then do putStrLn &quot;Too high!&quot;
                    doGuessing num
            else putStrLn &quot;You Win!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
If we think about how the &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt; construction works, it
essentially takes three arguments: the condition, the &quot;then&quot; branch,
and the &quot;else&quot; branch.  The condition needs to have type &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;,
and the two branches can have any type, provided that they have the
''same'' type.  The type of the entire &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt;
construction is then the type of the two branches.

In the outermost comparison, we have &lt;code&gt;(read guess) &lt; num&lt;/code&gt; as the
condition.  This clearly has the correct type.  Let's just consider
the &quot;then&quot; branch.  The code here is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
          do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we are sequencing two actions: &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt;.  The first has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which is fine.  The
second also has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which is fine.  The type result of the
entire computation is precisely the type of the final computation.
Thus, the type of the &quot;then&quot; branch is also &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.  A similar
argument shows that the type of the &quot;else&quot; branch is also
&lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.  This means the type of the entire &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt;
construction is &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which is just what we want.

Note: be careful if you find yourself thinking, &quot;Well, I already started
a &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt; block; I don't need another one.&quot; We can't have code like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    do if (read guess) &lt; num
         then putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
              doGuessing num
         else ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, since we didn't repeat the &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt;, the compiler doesn't know
that the &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; calls are supposed to be
sequenced, and the compiler will think you're trying to call
&lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; with three arguments: the string, the function
&lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; and the integer &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt;.  It will certainly complain
(though the error may be somewhat difficult to comprehend at this
point).

{{body note|1=
If you are using the &lt;tt&gt;'''If'''&lt;/tt&gt;-structure, remember that the &lt;tt&gt;'''else'''&lt;/tt&gt; branch is mandatory. Otherwise you will get compile errors!
}}

}}

== Actions under the microscope ==

Actions may look easy up to now, but they are actually a common stumbling block for new Haskellers.  If you have run into trouble working with actions, you might consider looking to see if one of your problems or questions matches the cases below.  It might be worth skimming this section now, and coming back to it when you actually experience trouble.

=== Mind your action types ===

One temptation might be to simplify our program for getting a name and printing it back out.  Here is one unsuccessful attempt:

{{HaskellExample|Why doesn't this work?|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do putStrLn &quot;What is your name? &quot;
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ getLine)
&lt;/source&gt;

Ouch! Error!

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
HaskellWikiBook.hs:3:26:
    Couldn't match expected type `[Char]'
           against inferred type `IO String'
}}
}}

Let us boil the example above down to its simplest form.  Would you expect this program to compile?

{{HaskellExample|1=This still does not work|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do putStrLn getLine
&lt;/source&gt;}}

For the most part, this is the same (attempted) program, except that we've stripped off the superfluous &quot;What is your name&quot; prompt as well as the polite &quot;Hello&quot;.  One trick to understanding this is to reason about it in terms of types.  Let us compare:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()
 getLine  :: IO String
&lt;/source&gt;
We can use the same mental machinery we learned in [[../Type basics/]] to figure how this went wrong.  Simply put, putStrLn is expecting a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; as input.  We do not have a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, but something tantalisingly close, an &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt;.  This represents an action that will ''give'' us a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; when it's run.  To obtain the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; wants, we need to run the action, and we do that with the ever-handy left arrow, &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;.

{{HaskellExample|1=This time it works|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do name &lt;- getLine
    putStrLn name
&lt;/source&gt;

Working our way back up to the fancy example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do putStrLn &quot;What is your name? &quot;
    name &lt;- getLine
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ name)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Now the name is the String we are looking for and everything is rolling again.

=== Mind your expression types too ===

So, we've made a big deal out of the idea that you can't use actions in situations that don't call for them.  The converse of this is that you can't use non-actions in situations that expect actions.  Say we want to greet the user, but this time we're so excited to meet them, we just have to SHOUT their name out:
{{HaskellExample|1=Exciting but incorrect.  Why?|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Char (toUpper)

main =
 do name &lt;- getLine
    loudName &lt;- makeLoud name
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
    putStrLn (&quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot; ++ loudName)

-- Don't worry too much about this function; it just capitalises a String
makeLoud :: String -&gt; String
makeLoud s = map toUpper s
&lt;/source&gt;

This goes wrong...
{{HaskellGHCi|1=
    Couldn't match expected type `IO' against inferred type `[]'
      Expected type: IO t
      Inferred type: String
    In a 'do' expression: loudName &lt;- makeLoud name
}}
}}

This is similar to the problem we ran into above: we've got a mismatch between something that is expecting an IO type, and something which does not produce one.  This time, the cause is our use of the left arrow &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;; we're trying to left arrow a value of &lt;code&gt;makeLoud name&lt;/code&gt;, which really isn't left arrow material.  It's basically the same mismatch we saw in the previous section, except now we're trying to use regular old String (the loud name) as an IO String, when those clearly are not the same thing.  The latter is an action, something to be run, whereas the former is just an expression minding its own business.  We cannot simply use &lt;code&gt;loudName = makeLoud name&lt;/code&gt; because a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; sequences ''actions'', and &lt;code&gt;loudName = makeLoud name&lt;/code&gt; is not an action.

So how do we extricate ourselves from this mess?  We have a number of options:
* We could find a way to turn &lt;code&gt;makeLoud&lt;/code&gt; into an action, to make it return &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt;. However, we don't want to make actions go out into the world for no reason. Within our program, we can reliably verify how everything is working. When actions engage the outside world, our results are much less predictable. An IO &lt;code&gt;makeLoud&lt;/code&gt; could be made somehow, but that would be misguided. Consider another issue though: what if we wanted to use makeLoud from some other, non-IO, function? We really don't want to engage IO actions except when absolutely necessary.
* We could use a special code called &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; to promote the loud name into an action, writing something like &lt;code&gt;loudName &lt;- return (makeLoud name)&lt;/code&gt;.  This is slightly better, in that we are at least leaving the &lt;code&gt;makeLoud&lt;/code&gt; function itself nice and IO-free, whilst using it in an IO-compatible fashion.  That's still moderately clunky because, by virtue of left arrow, we're implying that there's action to be had -- how exciting! -- only to let our reader down with a somewhat anticlimactic &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; (note: we will learn more about appropriate uses for &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; in later chapters).
* Or we could use a let binding...

It turns out that Haskell has a special extra-convenient syntax for let bindings in actions.  It looks a little like this:

{{HaskellExample|1=&lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks.|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do name &lt;- getLine
    let loudName = makeLoud name
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
    putStrLn (&quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot; ++ loudName)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

If you're paying attention, you might notice that the let binding above is missing an &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;.  This is because &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings inside &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks do not require the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword.  You could very well use it, but then you'd have messy extra do blocks.  For what it's worth, the following two blocks of code are equivalent.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!|sweet
!|unsweet
|-
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 do name &lt;- getLine
    let loudName = makeLoud name
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
    putStrLn (
        &quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot;
            ++ loudName)
&lt;/source&gt;
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 do name &lt;- getLine
    let loudName = makeLoud name
    in  do putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
           putStrLn (
               &quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot;
                   ++ loudName)
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

{{Exercises|
# Why does the unsweet version of the let binding require an extra &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; keyword?

Krummelpap is traditionally eaten at breakfast, mostly with a bit of milk, butter, and sugar, or at dinner, where it is served with a sauce like gravy.

It is slowly cooked on a stove.

==Ingredients==
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*250 ml water (boiling/hot) or more as needed
*700 ml maize

==Procedure==
#Add maize and salt to a large pot (like the one used for rice).
#Add a third of the water and mix with a fork so that it makes little balls or crumbs.
#Add more water but only a little at a time while mixing. Make sure that you don't add too much water.
#Put the stove on a LOW heat and stir with a fork every 10 minutes. Keep the lid on; it is the steam that cooks the maize.
#Taste it after 35 minutes to test if it is done. If it still tastes like maize, leave it - the wonder of this porridge is that you can't overcook, but you can burn it.
#It takes approximately 50 minutes to cook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Elementary Haskell}}

== Folds ==

A fold applies a function to a list in a way similar to &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt;, but returns a single result instead of a list.

For example, a function like &lt;tt&gt;sum&lt;/tt&gt; might be implemented as follows:

{{HaskellExample|sum|&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 sum :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer
 sum []     = 0
 sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs&lt;/source&gt;}}

or &lt;tt&gt;product&lt;/tt&gt;:

{{HaskellExample|product|&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 product :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer
 product []     = 1
 product (x:xs) = x * product xs&lt;/source&gt;}}

or &lt;tt&gt;concat&lt;/tt&gt;, which takes a list of lists and joins (concatenates) them into one:

{{HaskellExample|concat|&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 concat :: [[a]] -&gt; [a]
 concat []     = []
 concat (x:xs) = x ++ concat xs&lt;/source&gt;}}

There is a certain pattern of recursion common to all of these examples. This pattern is known as a fold, possibly from the idea that a list is being &quot;folded up&quot; into a single value, or that a function is being &quot;folded between&quot; the elements of the list.

The Standard Prelude defines four &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; functions: &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt;.

=== foldr ===

The ''right-associative'' &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; folds up a list from the right to left. As it proceeds, foldr uses the given function to combine each of the element with the running value called the ''accumulator''. When calling foldr, the initial value of the accumulator is set as an argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr            :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
foldr f acc []     = acc
foldr f acc (x:xs) = f x (foldr f acc xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument is a function with two arguments, the second is a &quot;zero&quot; value for the accumulator, and the third is the list to be folded.

In &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, and in &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;. In many cases, like all of our examples so far, the function passed to a fold will have both its arguments be of the same type, but this is not necessarily the case in general.

What &lt;tt&gt;foldr f acc xs&lt;/tt&gt; does is to replace each cons (:) in the &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; list with the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, and the empty list at the end with &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
a : b : c : []
&lt;/source&gt;

becomes

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f a (f b (f c acc))
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how the parentheses nest around the right end of the list.

An elegant visualisation is given by picturing the list data structure as a tree:
   :                         f
  / \                       / \
 a   :       foldr f acc   a   f
    / \    -------------&gt;     / \
   b   :                     b   f
      / \                       / \
     c  []                     c   acc

We can see here that &lt;tt&gt;foldr (:) []&lt;/tt&gt; would return the list completely unchanged. That sort of function that has no effect is called an ''identity function''. You should start building a habit of looking for identity functions in different cases, and we'll discuss them more later when we learn about ''monoids''.

=== foldl ===

The ''left-associative'' &lt;tt&gt;foldl&lt;/tt&gt; processes the list in the opposite direction, starting at the left side with the first element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldl            :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; a
foldl f acc []     =  acc
foldl f acc (x:xs) =  foldl f (f acc x) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

So brackets in the resulting expression accumulate on the left. Our list above, after being transformed by &lt;tt&gt;foldl f z&lt;/tt&gt; becomes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f (f (f acc a) b) c
&lt;/source&gt;

The corresponding trees look like:
   :                            f
  / \                          / \
 a   :       foldl f acc      f   c
    / \    -------------&gt;    / \
   b   :                    f   b 
      / \                  / \
     c  []                acc a

Because all folds include both left and right elements, beginners can get confused by the names. You could think of foldr as short for fold-right-to-left and foldl as fold-left-to-right. The names refer to where the fold starts.

{{body note|1=
''Technical Note'': foldl is ''tail-recursive'', that is, it recurses immediately, calling itself. For this reason the compiler will optimise it to a simple loop, which is a good thing performance-wise, and should count as an advantage in relation to &lt;tt&gt;foldr&lt;/tt&gt;. However, Haskell is a lazy language, and so the calls to ''f'' will be left unevaluated by default, thus building up an unevaluated expression in memory that includes the entire length of the list. To avoid running out of memory, there is a version of foldl called &lt;tt&gt;foldl'&lt;/tt&gt; that is ''strict'' in that it forces the evaluation of ''f'' immediately at each step.

An apostrophe at the end of a function name is pronounced &quot;tick&quot; as in &quot;fold-L-tick&quot;.  A tick is a valid character in Haskell identifiers.  foldl' can be found in the &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt; library module (which can be imported by adding &lt;tt&gt;import Data.List&lt;/tt&gt; to the beginning of a source file).  As a rule of thumb, you should use &lt;tt&gt;foldr&lt;/tt&gt; on lists that might be infinite or where the fold is building up a data structure and use &lt;tt&gt;foldl'&lt;/tt&gt; if the list is known to be finite and comes down to a single value. There is almost never a good reason to use &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; (without the tick), though it might just work if the lists fed to it are not too long.
}}

''

=== foldr1 and foldl1 ===

As previously noted, the type declaration for &lt;tt&gt;foldr&lt;/tt&gt; makes it quite possible for the list elements and result to be of different types.  For example, &quot;read&quot; is a function that takes a string and converts it into some type (the type system is smart enough to figure out which one).  In this case we convert it into a float.

{{HaskellExample|The list elements and results can have different types|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
addStr :: String -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
addStr str x = read str + x

sumStr :: [String] -&gt; Float
sumStr = foldr addStr 0.0&lt;/source&gt;
}}

If you substitute the types &lt;tt&gt;Float&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; for the type variables &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in the type of foldr you will see that this is type correct.

There is also a variant called &lt;tt&gt;foldr1&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;fold - R - one&quot;) which dispenses with an explicit zero by taking the last element of the list instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr1           :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; a
foldr1 f [x]     =  x
foldr1 f (x:xs)  =  f x (foldr1 f xs)
foldr1 _ []      =  error &quot;Prelude.foldr1: empty list&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

And &lt;tt&gt;foldl1&lt;/tt&gt; as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldl1           :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; a
foldl1 f (x:xs)  =  foldl f x xs
foldl1 _ []      =  error &quot;Prelude.foldl1: empty list&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note: Just like for foldl, the Data.List library includes foldl1' as a strict version of foldl1.''

With foldl1 and foldr1, all the types have to be the same and an empty list is an error. These variants are useful when there is no obvious candidate for the initial accumulator value and we are sure that the list is not going to be empty. When in doubt, stick with foldr or foldl'.

=== folds and laziness ===

One reason that right-associative folds are more natural to use in Haskell than left-associative ones is that right folds can operate on infinite lists. A fold that returns an infinite list is perfectly usable in a larger context that doesn't need to access the entire infinite result. In that case, foldr can move along as much as is needed and the compiler will not do any extra. However, a left fold necessarily calls itself recursively until it reaches the end of the input list (because the recursive call is not made in an argument to f). Needless to say, no end will be reached if an input list to foldl is infinite.

As a toy example, consider a function &lt;code&gt;echoes&lt;/code&gt; that takes a list of integers and produces a list such that wherever the number n occurs in the input list, it is replicated n times in the output list. To create our echoes function, we will use the prelude function &lt;code&gt;replicate&lt;/code&gt; in which &lt;tt&gt;replicate n x&lt;/tt&gt; is a list of length n with x the value of every element.

We can write echoes as a foldr quite handily:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
echoes = foldr (\ x xs -&gt; (replicate x x) ++ xs) []
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note:'' This definition is very compact thanks to the &lt;code&gt;\ x xs -&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax. Instead of defining a function somewhere else and passing it to foldr we provided the definition ''in situ''. &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; being the arguments and the right-hand side of the definition being what is after the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

or, equally handily, as a foldl:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
echoes = foldl (\xs x -&gt; xs ++ (replicate x x)) []
&lt;/source&gt;

but only the foldr version works on an infinite list like &lt;code&gt;[1..]&lt;/code&gt;. Try it! (If you try this in GHCi, remember you can stop an evaluation with Ctrl-c, but you have to be quick and keep an eye on the system monitor or your memory will be consumed in no time and your system will hang.)

As a final example, another thing that you might notice is that &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; itself can be implemented as a fold:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map f = foldr (\x xs -&gt; f x : xs) []
&lt;/source&gt;

Folding takes a little time to get used to, but it is a fundamental pattern in functional programming and eventually becomes very natural.  Any time you want to traverse a list and build up a result from its members, you likely want a fold.

{{Exercises|1=
#Define the following functions recursively (like the definitions for &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; above), then turn them into a fold:
#* &lt;code&gt;and :: [Bool] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns True if a list of Bools are all True, and False otherwise.
#* &lt;code&gt;or :: [Bool] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns True if any of a list of Bools are True, and False otherwise.
#Define the following functions using &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt;:
#* &lt;code&gt;maximum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the maximum element of a list (hint: &lt;code&gt;max :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; returns the maximum of two values).
#* &lt;code&gt;minimum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the minimum element of a list (hint: &lt;code&gt;min :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; returns the minimum of two values).
#Use a fold (''which one?'') to define &lt;code&gt;reverse :: [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a list with the elements in reverse order.

:Note that all of these are Prelude functions, so they will be always close at hand when you need them. (Also, that means you must use slightly different names in order to test your answers in GHCi.) 
}}

== Scans ==

A &quot;scan&quot; is much like a cross between a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and a fold.  Folding a list accumulates a single return value, whereas mapping puts each item through a function with no accumulation.  A scan does both: it accumulates a value like a fold, but instead of returning a final value it returns a list of all the intermediate values.

The Standard Prelude contains four scan functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanl   :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; [a] 	
&lt;/source&gt;

This accumulates the list from the left, and the second argument becomes the first item in the resulting list.  So  {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;scanl (+) 0 [1,2,3] = [0,1,3,6]&lt;/code&gt;}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanl1  :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] 
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the same as &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt;, but uses the first item of the list as a zero parameter.  It is what you would typically use if the input and output items are the same type.  Notice the difference in the type signatures. {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;scanl1 (+) [1,2,3] = [1,3,6]&lt;/code&gt;}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanr   :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
scanr1  :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions are the exact counterparts of &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanl1&lt;/code&gt;.  They accumulate the totals from the right.  So:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanr (+) 0 [1,2,3] = [6,5,3,0]
scanr1 (+) [1,2,3] = [6,5,3]

==filter==

A very common operation performed on lists is [[Wikipedia:Filter (mathematics)|filtering]], which means generating a new list composed only of elements of the first list that meet a certain condition. One simple example of that would be taking a list of integers and making from it a list which only retains its even numbers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]
retainEven [] = []
retainEven (n:ns) =
-- mod n 2 computes the remainder for the integer division of n by 2, so if it is zero the number is even
  if ((mod n 2) == 0)
    then n : (retainEven ns)
    else retainEven ns
&lt;/source&gt;

That works fine, but it is a slightly verbose solution. It would be nice to have a more concise and general way to write the filter function. This is already provided by Prelude as &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt; with the following type signature:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/source&gt;

So, a &lt;tt&gt;(a -&gt; Bool)&lt;/tt&gt; function tests an elements for the condition, there is a list to be filtered, and it returns the filtered list. In order to write &lt;tt&gt;retainEven&lt;/tt&gt; using &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt;, we need to state the condition as an auxiliary &lt;tt&gt;(a -&gt; Bool)&lt;/tt&gt; function, like this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
isEven :: Int -&gt; Bool 
isEven n = ((mod n 2) == 0) 
&lt;/source&gt;

And then retainEven becomes simply:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven ns = filter isEven ns
&lt;/source&gt;

We used ns instead of xs just because it is sensible to indicate that we know these are numbers and not just anything, but we can ignore that and use a more terse point-free definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven = filter isEven
&lt;/source&gt;

This is just like what we demonstrated before for &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; and the folds. Like &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt;, those take another function as argument; and using them point-free emphasizes this &quot;functions-of-functions&quot; aspect.

==List comprehensions==

A a powerful, concise, and expressive syntactic tool for list processing is the [[Wikipedia:List comprehension|list comprehension]]. Among other things, list comprehensions can be [[Wikipedia:Syntactic sugar|syntactic sugar]] for filtering. Instead of using the Prelude &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt;, we could write &lt;tt&gt;retainEven&lt;/tt&gt; like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven es = [ n | n &lt;- es , isEven n ]
&lt;/source&gt;

This compact syntax may look a bit intimidating at first, but it is simple to break down. One interpretation is:

* (Starting from the middle) Take the list ''es'' and draw (the &quot;&lt;-&quot;) each of its elements as a value ''n''.
* (After the comma) For each drawn ''n'' test the boolean condition &lt;code&gt;isEven n&lt;/code&gt;.
* (Before the vertical bar) If (and only if) the boolean condition is satisfied, prepend ''n'' to the new list being created (note the square brackets around the whole expression).

Thus, if &lt;code&gt;es&lt;/code&gt; is equal to [1,2,3,4], then we would get back the list [2,4]. 1 and 3 were not drawn because &lt;code&gt;(isEven n) == False &lt;/code&gt;. 

The power of list comprehensions comes from being easily extensible. Firstly, we can use as many tests as we wish (even zero!). Multiple conditions are written as a comma-separated list of expressions (which should evaluate to a Boolean, of course). For a simple example, suppose we want to modify &lt;tt&gt;retainEven&lt;/tt&gt; so that only numbers larger than 100 are retained:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainLargeEvens :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]
retainLargeEvens es = [ n | n &lt;- es , isEven n, n &gt; 100 ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Furthermore, we are not limited to using &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; as the element to be prepended when generating a new list. Instead, we could place any expression before the vertical bar (if it is compatible with the type of the list, of course). For instance, if we wanted to subtract one from every even number, all it would take is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
evensMinusOne es = [ n - 1 | n &lt;- es , isEven n ]
&lt;/source&gt;

In effect, that means the list comprehension syntax incorporates the functionality of &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; as well as of &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt;. Now ''that'' is concise (and still readable too)!

To further sweeten things, the left arrow notation in list comprehensions can be combined with pattern matching.  For example, suppose we had a list of &lt;code&gt;(Int, Int)&lt;/code&gt; tuples and we would like to construct a list with the first element of every tuple whose second element is even. Using list comprehensions, we might write it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
firstForEvenSeconds :: [(Int, Int)] -&gt; [Int]
firstForEvenSeconds ps = [ fst p | p &lt;- ps, isEven (snd p) ] -- here, p is for pairs.
&lt;/source&gt;

Patterns can make it much more readable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
firstForEvenSeconds ps = [ x | (x,y) &lt;- ps, isEven y ]
&lt;/source&gt;

As in other cases, arbitrary expressions may be used before the |. If we wanted a list with the double of those first elements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds :: [(Int, Int)] -&gt; [Int]
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds ps = [ 2 * x | (x,y) &lt;- ps, isEven y ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Not counting spaces, that function code is shorter than its descriptive name!

There are even more possible tricks:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
allPairs :: [(Int, Int)]
allPairs = [ (x, y) | x &lt;- [1..4], y &lt;- [5..8] ]
&lt;/source&gt;

This comprehension draws from ''two'' lists, and generates all possible &lt;code&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; pairs with the first element in &lt;code&gt;[1..4]&lt;/code&gt; and the second in &lt;code&gt;[5..8]&lt;/code&gt;. In the final list of pairs, the first elements will be those generated with the first element of the first list (here, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;), then those with the second element of the first list, and so on. In this example, the full list is (linebreaks added for clarity):

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; [(x,y)|x&lt;-[1..4],y&lt;-[5..8]]
[(1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(1,8),
 (2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),
 (3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8),
 (4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(4,8)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that we didn't do any filtering here; but we could easily add a condition to restrict the combinations that go into the final list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
somePairs = [ (x, y) | x &lt;- [1..4], y &lt;- [5..8], x + y &gt; 8 ]
&lt;/source&gt;

This lists only has the pairs with the sum of elements larger than 8; starting with &lt;code&gt;(1,8)&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;(2,7)&lt;/code&gt; and so forth.

{{Exercises|1=
# Write a &lt;code&gt;returnDivisible :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]&lt;/code&gt; function which filters a list of integers retaining only the numbers divisible by the integer passed as first argument.

Also, your function must not trigger an error when it meets an empty &lt;tt&gt;[Int]&lt;/tt&gt;, so you'll need to add an additional test to detect emptiness.

=Blair Witch Project/Cloverfield=

''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[Cloverfield]]'' differ from the standard shooting style in several different ways.

* The whole film is presented as if it were an unedited documentary, filmed by the protagonists, and as such the shooting style resembles that of an amateur documentary or a home movie. 
* This includes shaking shots when the characters are running and more or less useless or irrelevant shots when the characters are just fooling around with the cameras.
* A large part of the Blair Witch Project is in black and white, as one of the cameras that the protagonists carry with them only shoots in this format. This adds to the realism of the movie.

=Ken Loach=

The films of Ken Loach have an incredible authenticity and 'realness' to them.  How does he achieve this?

Taken from &quot;Loach on Loach&quot;

* Never use [[w:Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]]
* Run the entire scene for every shot, don't break the scene down into little &quot;shot length&quot; segments.
* Light the entire scene so you're not artificially telling the audience &quot;THIS is the lead actor for this scene, the others are less important&quot;
* Don't give the actors marks (indeed, you don't have to because you're lighting the entire scene)
* Actors should have vulnerabilities

=Dogme/Dogma=

From [http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/28/dogme1.html Bright Lights Film Journal]: ''Copyrights lawyers are out of luck. Anyone can obtain a Dogme certificate if he (or she) shoots a film in accordance with the ten rules known as &quot;The Vow of Chastity.&quot;''

===The Vow of Chastity===

* Shooting on location (no imported props or sets)
* Sound and image produced together
* A handheld camera
* Natural light
* No optical work or filters
* No superficial action (murders, weapons)
* No temporal or geographic alienation
* No genre films
* Film format must be Academy 35mm.
* No signature; the director must not be credited.

=Alfred Hitchcock=

A man dedicated to suspense and intrigue

Emotion is the ultimate goal of each of his shots.  Hitchcock believed that emotion came directly from the actor's eyes.  By bringing us closer or tearing us away he used camera angles to jerk us into the feeling of his moments.

The camera should be just like a person looking around for something out of place in a room.  This allows the audience to feel like they are involved the action.  Scenes can often begin by panning a room showing close-ups of objects that explain plot elements.

Hitchcock also loved to keep us on our toes by throwing in shots fast and close after being slow and far...

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Temperature?==
There are a few ways we can describe temperature. But a large amount of them are surprisingly poor. Sadi Carnot for instance imagined heat as a liquid, and it was this view that allowed him to develop heat engine theory.

Here we will develop a way of viewing temperature that makes it useful in a Thermodynamic point of View.

==Two systems in Thermal Contact==
Imagine two systems, 1 and 2, with total energy E = E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Entropy S = S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conservation of energy of the system means that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = E - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; always.

Differentiating by E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; we see that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{matrix}
\frac{d E_2}{d E_1} &amp;=&amp; \frac{d(E - E_1)}{dE_1} \\ 
&amp;=&amp; -\frac{d E_1}{dE_1} \\
&amp;=&amp; -1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now if we look at Entropy changing with Energy.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial E_1} = \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} + \frac{d S_2}{d E_1}
= \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} + \frac{d S_2}{d E_2}\frac{d E_2}{d E_1} = \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} - \frac{d S_2}{d E_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

At equilibrium there is no change in entropy, so when the systems are at the same temperature
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial E_1} = \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} - \frac{d S_2}{d E_2} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We use this to define Temperature.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; T^{-1} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E}_{N,V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
N and V means the Volume and Number of Particles is fixed.

Or for a specific system
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; T_i^{-1} = \frac{\partial S_i}{\partial E_i}_{N_i,V_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Usage==
If we were to look at how entropy changed with temperature, it is easy to show that as entropy always increases, energy always flows from the hotter body to the cooler one. Try it.

One of the equations wasn't parsing correctly at the time of writing. I've left it as is because the error message was 'Unknown Function \begin' which should be recognised. I'm not really sure what the problem is.

[[Image:Food Processor 2.jpg|thumb|An electric food processor]]

A '''food processor''' is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate various repetitive tasks in the process of preparation of food. In modern times, it is usually equipped with an electric motor, although there are manual versions.

Typically, a food processor will have a vessel (called a bowl), with a removable lid to contain ingredients during processing operations. The lid has an integrated feeder tube to allow the introduction of unprocessed food during operation. At a minimum, a removable rotating blade that [[Cookbook:Chopping|chops]] or [[Cookbook:Purée|purées]] (depending on the speed and duration of processing selected) the food is fitted within the bowl. Often food processors can accommodate other kinds of blades. For example, bladed discs for [[Cookbook:Slicing|slicing]], [[Cookbook:Grater|shredding]], or grinding. Occasionally, food processors can be fitted with other devices that allow it to overlap completely in function with other kitchen appliances. For example, [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]], [[Cookbook:Beater|beater]], [[Cookbook:Dough Hook|dough hook]], or juicer attachments (such as with the processor pictured).

Here are several nice features that make using functions easier.

== let and where revisited ==

As discussed in earlier chapters, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; are useful in local function definitions. Here, &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
addStr :: Float -&gt; String -&gt; Float
addStr x str = x + read str

sumStr :: [String] -&gt; Float
sumStr = foldl addStr 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

But what if we never need &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; anywhere else? Then we could rewrite &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; using local bindings. We can do that either with a &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; binding...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sumStr =
   let addStr x str = x + read str
   in foldl addStr 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

... or with a &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sumStr = foldl addStr 0.0
   where addStr x str = x + read str
&lt;/source&gt;

... and the difference appears to be just a question of style: Do we prefer the bindings to come before or after the rest of the definition?

However, there is another important difference between &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;let...in&lt;/tt&gt; construct is an expression just like if/then/else. In contrast, &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses are like guards and so are not expressions. Thus, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings can be used within complex expressions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x =
    if x &gt; 0
        then (let lsq = (log x) ^ 2 in tan lsq) * sin x
        else 0
&lt;/source&gt;

The expression within the outer parentheses is self-contained, and evaluates to the tangent of the square of the logarithm of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the scope of &lt;code&gt;lsq&lt;/code&gt; does not extend beyond the parentheses; so changing the then-branch to

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
        then (let lsq = (log x) ^ 2 in tan lsq) * (sin x + lsq)
&lt;/source&gt;

does not work without dropping the parentheses around the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;.

Despite not being full expressions, &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses ''can'' be incorporated into &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expressions: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
describeColour c = 
   &quot;This colour &quot;
   ++ case c of
          Black -&gt; &quot;is black&quot;
          White -&gt; &quot;is white&quot;
          RGB red green blue -&gt; &quot; has an average of the components of &quot; ++ show av
             where av = (red + green + blue) `div` 3
   ++ &quot;, yeah?&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the indentation of the &lt;tt&gt;where&lt;/tt&gt; clause sets the scope of the &lt;tt&gt;av&lt;/tt&gt; variable so that it only exists as far as the &lt;tt&gt;RGB red green blue&lt;/tt&gt; case is concerned. Placing it at the same indentation of the cases would make it available for all cases. Here is an example with guards:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doStuff :: Int -&gt; String
doStuff x
  | x &lt; 3     = report &quot;less than three&quot;
  | otherwise = report &quot;normal&quot;
  where
    report y = &quot;the input is &quot; ++ y
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that since there is one equals sign for each guard there is no place we could put a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; expression which would be in scope of all guards in the manner of the &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause. So this is a situation in which &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; is particularly convenient.

== Anonymous Functions - lambdas ==

Why create a formal name for a function like &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; when it only exists within another function's definition, never to be used again? Instead, we can make it an anonymous function also known as a &lt;code&gt;lambda function&lt;/code&gt;. Then, &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; could be defined like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sumStr = foldl (\ x str -&gt; x + read str) 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

The expression in the parentheses is a lambda function.  The backslash is used as the nearest ASCII equivalent to the Greek letter lambda (&amp;lambda;). This lambda function takes two arguments, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, and it evaluates to &quot;x + read str&quot;. So, the &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; presented just above is precisely the same as the one that used &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; in a let binding.

Lambdas are handy for writing one-off functions to be used with maps, folds and their siblings, especially where the function in question is simple (beware of cramming complicated expressions in a lambda — it can hurt readability).

Since variables are being bound in a lambda expression (to the arguments, just like in a regular function definition), pattern matching can be used in them as well. A trivial example would be redefining &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; with a lambda:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
tail' = (\ (_:xs) -&gt; xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: Since lambdas are a special character in Haskell, the &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; on its own will be treated as the function and whatever non-space character is next will be the variable for the first argument. It is still good form to put a space between the lambda and the argument as in normal function syntax (especially to make things clearer when a lambda takes more than one argument).

==  Operators ==

In Haskell, any function that takes two arguments and has a name consisting entirely of non-alphanumeric characters is considered an ''operator''. The most common examples are the arithmetical ones like addition (+) and subtraction (-). Unlike other functions, operators are normally used infix (written between the two arguments). All operators can also be surrounded with parentheses and then used prefix like other functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- these are the same:
2 + 4
(+) 2 4
&lt;/source&gt;

We can define new operators in the usual way as other functions — just don't use any alphanumeric characters in their names. For example, here's the set-difference definition from &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(\\) :: (Eq a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
xs \\ ys = foldl (\zs y -&gt; delete y zs) xs ys
&lt;/source&gt;

As the example above shows, operators can be defined infix as well. The same definition written as prefix also works:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(\\) xs ys = foldl (\zs y -&gt; delete y zs) xs ys
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the type declarations for operators have no infix version and must be written with the parentheses.

=== Sections ===

''Sections'' are a nifty piece of syntactical sugar that can be used with operators. An operator within parentheses and flanked by one of its arguments...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(2+) 4
(+4) 2
&lt;/source&gt;

... is a  new function in its own right. &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, has the type &lt;code&gt;(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. We can pass sections to other functions, e.g. &lt;code&gt;map (+2) [1..4] == [3..6]&lt;/code&gt;. For another example, we can add an extra flourish to the &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; function we wrote back in More about lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList m = map (m*)
&lt;/source&gt;


If you have a &quot;normal&quot; prefix function and want to use it as an operator, simply surround it with backticks:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
1 `elem` [1..4]
&lt;/source&gt;

This is called making the function ''infix''. It's normally done for readability purposes: &lt;code&gt;1 `elem` [1..4]&lt;/code&gt; reads better than &lt;code&gt;elem 1 [1..4]&lt;/code&gt;. You can also define functions infix:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
elem :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
x `elem` xs = any (==x) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

But once again notice that the type signature stays with the prefix style.

Sections even work with infix functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(1 `elem`) [1..4]
(`elem` [1..4]) 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, remember that you can only make binary functions (that is, those that take two arguments) infix..

{{Exercises|1=
* Lambdas are a nice way to avoid defining unnecessary separate functions. Convert the following let- or where-bindings to lambdas:
** &lt;code&gt;map f xs where f x = x * 2 + 3&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;let f x y = read x + y in foldr f 1 xs&lt;/code&gt;
* Sections are just syntactic sugar for lambda operations. I.e. &lt;code&gt;(+2)&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; x + 2&lt;/code&gt;. What would the following sections 'desugar' to? What would be their types?
** &lt;code&gt;(4+)&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;(1 `elem`)&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;(`notElem` &quot;abc&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Re: admins.  I agree, and will try to clean up the requests for adminship page. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 16:30, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:And with Gentgeen's and my support, I have promoted you.  Let me know if you have any questions about admining. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 20:41, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== new shortcuts ==

These new WB:''FOO'' shortcuts are not short. That defeats the whole point of having them. One may as well click their way to the page instead.
: They are, however, consistent with how it is done in Wikipedia. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 00:34, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:: Wikipedia is such that any 3-letter shortcut will cause a conflict. Thus, the prefix. Wikibooks already prefixes books to avoid inter-book conflicts, so you can leave off the &quot;WB:&quot; for shortcuts. You might lowercase them too; most non-flamers can type lowercase faster than uppercase.
::: First, sign your posts so I know who is writing... second, it's virtually some form of &quot;unwritten&quot; convention that &quot;WB&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks&quot; are reserved &quot;book names&quot; for project use (consistent with one of the two major naming conventions - even then the faux-namespace convention is up to debate - [[Cookbook]] uses it but [[Wikijunior]] does not).  As for lowercase, that could be made in the near future... [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 03:10, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Slow VFD ==
One reason that VfD can seem to be slow is not necessarily the number of admins, but the number of legitimate ''votes'' and thus the arising of a clear consensus. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:26, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

True, but you can't blame the community on that.  I thought admins were to assume that a lack of votes meant that the community was largely apathetic (although that could be deletionist POV).  Oh well, I wouldn't touch those executive decision stuff for a while (I consider myself a &quot;junior admin&quot; and believe only &quot;senior admins&quot; could do that...)... [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:10, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

==Protection==
Hi. I saw your report in [[MediaZilla:2197|MediaZilla]] about the [[Main Page]] here. Currently, it is only protected against page moves, not editing. If you want it really protected, you or another admin will need to protect it without selecting the &quot;protect from page moves&quot; box. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 04:38, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for the how-to.  That I didn't know about before. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:41, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== anon user blocks ==

Please consider that IP addresses get reassigned. I'm reminded of the problems had in sending email from a newly-purchased block of IP addresses whose previous owner was a spammer. IP address reuse is something like this:
*dial-up - less than 1 day
*cable modem IP assignment via DHCP lease - a few months
*dorm room assignment - 3 to 10 months
*apartment lease - 1 year
*employment - won't go on forever, and employers reassign addresses too
So a year should do the job, right?
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:48, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

True, but these blocks are consistent with similar blocks on other IPs by other admins. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 07:18, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== The Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire walkthrough ==

I believe you are right that it is a copywrite violation. I've found the source of this page, with use of Google. It comes from [http://faqs.ign.com/articles/503/503704p1.html], a walkthrough which says who has permission to use it: 
            Copyright Notice: This is Copyright ©2004 by Jason Howell and me frog
                        (Colin Scully), and may only be used on Gamefaqs.com,

                        contact and possible Legal action.

It also says at the end:

I found this page using two quotes (one of which has a grammer mistake), and found a few other quotes there as well. And if you look at the history of that page, you can see that it is in the process of being converted from a text file (like it would be at Gamefaqs.com) to wiki-project formatting.

[[User:Ivyboy|Ivyboy]] deleted all the information about us trying to have his illegally copied page removed from Wikibooks. Is there anything to be done about this?

By the way, I wonder if there is any connection between his name and Bulbaboy from Wikipedia. (Another illegal copying of Pokémon web stuff?)
[[User:User142|User142]] 15:42, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:Just noticed this.  First off, as I've said, he's not me (looks like he's trying to piss me off though), and I can assure you I haven't knowingly infringed any copyrights. - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 04:16, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== Type Affinity vs. Type Matching ==

1)  I have not found a single place in Wikipedia or Wikibooks where the phraze &quot;Type Affinity&quot; is used.
: Try [[Pokémon:Battle Basics]]. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 20:54, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
:: Are there any other pages in Wikipedia or Wikibooks? If not, changing &quot;tpye affinity&quot; in one section of one page is a lot easier than changing 387 Pokémon pages.[[User:User142|User142]] 08:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

2)  On the web, I've found that both names are used.

Since currently, the only term used in Wikipedia and Wikibooks to describe this is &quot;Type Matching&quot;, and since this term is used elsewhere, we should continue using this term in the Wiki projects.

== How can I insert a picture from Wikipedia? ==

I am working on a Pokemon walkthrough (One which is my own work, not from some on-line source which is copywrited by someone else!). I think that the Type Chart from Wikipedia should go in it. The tag there is &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Pokemon_Type_Chart.PNG|thumb|right|Type Chart]]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;. How can I insert it here in Wikibooks?

: Just for the record, remember to put the walkthrough in the Pokémon space and not the Wikibooks Pokédex space.  Anyways, I don't think you can use templates across wikis - best to just copy and paste. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:30, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== Ivyboy needs to be banned, for days already! ==

Please ban [[User:Ivyboy]] ASAP. He has:

#repeatedly removed legit (justified, etc.) VfD notices
#repeatedly removed VfD discussion instead of participating in it
#moved the [[User:Bulbaboy]] page over his own, making the users appear to be the same

I think you can consider all this to be his vote against the pages he has created, so that all can be quickly dealt with too.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:10, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

As the person who clued in to his activities by putting the vfd notice, I have to let another admin do the dirty work (ethical reasons).  But rest assured that another admin is on the case. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:33, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

In general I like that policy and wish every admin would follow it. I think moving Bulbaboy's user page was pretty extreme though. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:56, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== A question regarding copywrite (NOT about Ivyboy) ==

If when playing the game I miss how much money a particular trainer pays the winning player, may I copy that from a walkthrough which says &quot;''Certain in-game content (as in enemy status info, etc can be re-published on any FAQ or Site, but must be written in your own words.''&quot;? After all, the number is a number, and there is only one natural way to represent it. (By the way, the site I'm talking about IS the same site which [[User:Ivyboy|Ivyboy]] stole from, but I am not going to do such a thing!)[[User:User142|User142]] 17:32, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

== My new Walkthrough ==

I would like you to express your opinion about [[Wikibooks Pokémon:User142 Ruby Walkthrough|my Ruby walkthrough]].

By the way, most of the page is actually in the templates, and when I make the Sapphire walkthrough I will just need to put in the templates with a few small changes. Any later edit will be done at the same place for both. Wikibooks is good for doing it in this way. One of the things I dislike about most walkthroughs is the face that the Ruby and Sapphire (or the Gold and Silver, or the Red abd Blue) data is all together, and it doesn't look nice even if it is readable.
[[User:User142|User142]] 09:45, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I'm guessing that eventually you might move it to a place that fits the book's naming conventions (such as [[Pokémon:Pokémon Ruby Walkthrough]]), right?  It's just that using &quot;Wikibooks Pokémon&quot; makes me somewhat uneasy (the name &quot;Wikibooks Pokédex&quot; was chosen as there was one at Wikipedia, hence to differentiate the two).  Also, you might want to stick to [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions|Wikibooks naming conventions]] here, and put the book title in the page title (eg. [[Pokémon:Pokémon Ruby Walkthrough:Start Game Ruby]] or [[Pokémon:Pokémon Ruby Walkthrough/Start Game Ruby]] rather than [[Start Game Ruby]], which is ambiguous in regards to which book it is a part of).

Hello, this is Strongbad! Thanks for your help; I moved my walkthrough and fixed all of the
relevant links. I hope to finish it one day and contribute to the wikibook in other ways.
(I'm trying to beat Fire Red right now; maybe I can work on that one as well?) Also, I've
been wondering about a few things. Is there a simple way to type the e-accent in the title?
That pops up quite often, and I'm pretty sure there's a keyboard shortcut for it. By the
way, is there anything else you want to say to me regarding the wikibook? Thanks.

Hi. I'm sorry about the late reply; I don't come by much all that often than I ought, and I should perhaps try and make an effort and do some work rehashing my content and making sure they're still all fresh and whatever.
But on to pressing matters: I think your proposal reads without any major problems arising immediately in my mind, which is a Good Thing. Its important to categorize our content closely, in order to distinguish How-To type texts from texts aiming to be self-contained references to texts aiming for a nonfiction feel. If I can comment on any Wikibooks pages with any policy proposals, let me know, and I'll throw in my two cents. Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:41, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

This is a guide on how to install Mambo Open Source for a complete newbie. I will assume that you have transfered the files to a compitable server. If not, please read the [[Mambo Open Source/Placing_the_files|placing the files]]-article.

This part of the installation ensures that the server is compatible with Mambo and that Mambo will run on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MAMBOTOC_SMALL}}

For Mambo to work, you need to place the files in a supported environment. There are several options available, this article explains the two main options.

==Local==

If you have a server system compitable with Mambo on the same computer that you work on, this is called local placement of files. It means that you place the files the same location as you are placing them from. Follow this link for more information about [[Mambo_Open_Source/Server_requirements|server and system requirements]].

The only thing you will need to know is the root folder of your server - place mambo within this folder. The correct location varies depending on your platform:

*''MSAS'' - C:/Program Files/MSAS/http_root/www
*''Linux'' - www/public_html/
*''Mac OS X'' - /Library/WebServer/Documents
*''Apache on windows'' - C:/Program Files/Apache Group/htdocs

This root folder will be the folder that opens when entering the server - in a local setting this is mostly done by entering &quot;localhost&quot; or the corresponding IP, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, as URL. If you place mambo in a folder called &quot;cool&quot; inside your server root (e.g. C:/Program Files/MSAS/http_root/www/cool), you will have to enter &quot;localhost/cool&quot; in your browser to visit your &quot;cool&quot; Mambo website.

==Remote==

This explains the process of moving the files from your local computer to a remote location, as e.g a webserver.

===Getting and FTP program and connect===

Remote placement of files means that the files will be placed somewhere else than on your own computer. Do do this, you will need a program that allows you to, and in this case an [[w:Comparison of FTP clients|FTP-programm]] will be suitable. There are many good, free ftp programs available, here are some recomendations:

*[http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/ FileZilla]
*[http://www.ipswitch.com/ ws_ftp] - standard specs ftp client.
*[http://www.smartftp.com/ SmartFTP] - lots of advanced features, as secure connections.

After installing the program, you will need to set it up for connection to the remote location. You must have the correct access information for this, as username and password, and you also need to know how to use this data properly in the FTP-program. This varies from program to program, but usually it is something like this:

*Enter your username in the username field
*Enter yout password in the password field
*Enter the adress to the remote location in the adress field
*Press connect!

This should solve your problem, but if it doesn't, contact the owner of the remote location, usually a webhost, and ask for details about FTP connection.

===Transfer the files to the remote location===

After setting up a proper connection to the remote location, you will need to transfer the files to it. The way this is done varies very much from server to server, and there are many ways of doing it. This is a very common explanation of how it shoud be done, that may not fit exactly to all cases.

Once you login to the remote location via the ftp program, you will probably get a list of folders. This may be ''public_html'', ''public_ftp'', ''cgi-bin'' and ''www''. This is different from server to server. Anyway, almost all servers have one of these or both: ''public_html'' and ''www''. It should not matter in wich of these folders you put the content, they are usually overlapping each other.

This folder is called the root of the site. When you enter the site by it's URL, you see the content of the root folder. If you have a website there, it will show! Take a look at these examples:

*''www.domain.com'' takes you to ''public_html''
*''www.domain.com/folder'' takes you to ''public_html/folder''
*''folder.domain.com'' sometimes return ''public_html/folder'' too - it depends on how the server is configured.

When you place mambo into this, you should place the files directly to the public_html or www folder. Mambo supports installation on subfolders, so if that is what you need do it - but usually you don't want this, the Mambo site should simply appear when your visitor types www.domain.com.</text>

Would it help if this page were moved to Human Performance Technology, which links to it, but is otherwise blank?

I cannot see why it should be deleted, but agree that it might be better placed under Human Performance Technology

== ==Why no full book view?== ==

Is it just me or there is not a way to see the full book view of QBasic. Why is there no link to see the ull book view of this book? Thank you.

== May I suggest Restructuring ==

If you don't mind, I'd like to completely restructure this wikibook so it takes a more pleasing form, so people who have no programming experiance could look at this wikibook and know where to go. 

One thing I will do, is add a full book view for Kushal_one.  Look forward to other stuffs added to this wikibook by me.

[[User:Scud43|Scud43]]  14:35, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

I will be going through the pages and restructuring them. I may also add images (depending on how I feel. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 01:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

== The Appendix ==

I am currently going through all the QBasic commands and putting them into the appendix. Wont be ready for a while and I may need help.

== Just wondering where this could go... ==

I just did a major overhaul of the QBasic article on Wikipedia. In the proccess, I removed two excessively large example programs from the article, which I thought didn't belong in an encyclopedia, but were more of a tutorial thing. So here they are, I hope someone finds a place for them here:

&lt;pre&gt;
DO
 CLS            'This clears the screen.  It's the default first line, as it gets rid of
                'unwanted text and graphics.  By the way, the apostrophe is a comment.
                'Everything past it is ignored by QBasic, which is why I can say anything.

 PRINT &quot;Press escape to end the insane beeping!  Muahaha!&quot;  'PRINT prints text to the screen.
                                                            'The quotes tell Qbasic that the stuff
                                                            'inside is a ''string''. PRINT can be
                                                            'replaced by a question mark &quot;?&quot;.

 DO WHILE INKEY$ &lt;&gt; CHR$(27)  'Checks to see if the user is pressing &quot;escape&quot;; the
  'ASCII value of that key is represented by &quot;CHR$(27)&quot;,
  'the ASCII value of escape is 27.  &quot;DO WHILE&quot; creates a loop, saying &quot;Do this until
  'the user [[whatever comes after the &quot;DO WHILE&quot;, in our case presses escape]]

  LET x% = INT(RND * 9000 + 100) '&quot;LET&quot;-This &quot;declares&quot; the variable.  It's obsolete, so you could

                 '32767 Hz, and only girls and a few other humans can easily hear pitches much beyond
                 '14000 or so.  The writer of this program may have little hearing much beyond

In this tutorial we cover initializing the Super Nintendo and changing the background to a beautiful shade of green.  

== Required Tools ==
* The [http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html WLA-65816 Macro Assembler]. There are the [http://www.mediafire.com/?eownw7vsmimasad binaries for Linux 32 bit]
* A SNES emulator, such as [http://byuu.org/bsnes/ bsnes], [http://www.zsnes.com Zsnes] or [http://www.snesemu.net/windows.html Geiger's debugging version of Snes9x, for windows].
* An initialization routine and a header. The initialization routine is self-explanatory; it's a piece of code that clears/resets system values and sets the SNES up for use. The header contains assembler directives for WLA which do things like define the ROM's name, size, vectors, etc.

== The Tutorial ==

=== Assembler directives ===

If you decide to put the init routine and the header in separate files, it will be necessary to tell the assembler to include them.
 .include &quot;header.inc&quot;
 .include &quot;Snes_Init.asm&quot;
 VBlank:    ; Needed to satisfy interrupt definition in &quot;header.inc&quot;
     RTI
This part can be skipped by putting the header and init code in your main file.

You can find the [[Super NES Programming/Initialization_Tutorial/Snes_Init| ASM-code for the Snes_Init.asm here on Wikibooks]], and you can find [[Super NES Programming/Initialization_Tutorial/header| the header here.]]

=== Starting the program ===

In the header file, the label &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Start&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; is declared as the reset vector, so that is where the program shall begin executing:

 Start:

=== Initializing the SNES ===

Most demos reset the SNES to a known state.  Since emulators probably start in a known state, it may be unnecessary to reset the state for an emulated ROM.  Resetting the SNES, however, may be necessary for the demo to run on actual SNES hardware.

To reset the SNES, we set a number of hardware registers to zero and zero all the bytes in WRAM.  Here, we use the initialization macro &lt;tt&gt;Snes_Init&lt;/tt&gt; from the file &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Snes_Init.asm&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; from the SNES Devkit, which does this for us:

     ; Initialize the SNES.
     Snes_Init

=== Setting the background color ===

First, we set the accumulator to 8 bits, to modify single bytes of RAM.  We do this by setting the appropriate bit in the CPU status register:

     sep     #$20        ; Set the A register to 8-bit.

==== Step 1: Force VBlank ====

The SNES refreshes its screen to match the signal output to the television, so knowing how the television updates its image can help you understand how certain special effects are performed in the SNES.

A television displays an image on the screen using an electron beam, which it sweeps across the screen from left to right, one horizontal line at a time from top to bottom.  Additionally, television images are ''interlaced'', meaning that the television alternates displaying a screenful of all the even-numbered scanlines with a screenful of all the odd-numbered scanlines; each screen of even- or odd-numbered scanlines is called a ''field''.  An NTSC television (as used in the U.S. and Japan) displays roughly 30 frames per second, while a PAL television (as used everywhere else) displays 25 frames per second.  Thus, an NTSC television displays about 60 fields per second, while a PAL television displays 50 fields per second.

Between lines, when the electron beam is being moved from the right end of one scanline to the left beginning of the next scanline, the electron beam is turned off; this is called the ''horizontal blank'' or ''HBlank''.  Certain special effects -- like the perspective effects of the Final Fantasy VI airship -- can be performed on the SNES by changing graphics settings during HBlank.

Likewise, between fields, when the electron beam is being moved from the bottom of the screen to the top, the electron beam is turned off; this is called ''vertical blank'' or ''VBlank''.  If you update the screen while the electron beam is turned on, the results displayed to the user are unpredictable; they may shear or have other artifacts.  Therefore, you want to make all your modifications to the screen during HBlank or VBlank.  Since VBlank is much longer than HBlank and covers the whole screen, most updates should be done during VBlank.  VBlank occurs once per field, or about 60 times per second on NTSC machines and 50 times per second on PAL machines.

There are two ways to ensure that your code executes during a VBlank:
* Wait for a VBlank non-maskable interrupt ('''NMI''').
* Turn off the screen by setting the eighth bit of the Screen Display Register ($2100).

Here, we force VBlank by turning off the screen, using the following code:

     lda     #%10000000  ; Force VBlank by turning off the screen.
     sta     $2100

==== Step 2: Setting the Background Color ====

The SNES stores 16-bit colors in the following format:
* &lt;tt&gt;High byte: 0bbbbbgg&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;Low byte:  gggrrrrr&lt;/tt&gt;

The color that we will use is &lt;tt&gt;00000000 11100000&lt;/tt&gt; (0 blue, 7 green, 0 red) -- a dark green.  We set the background color of the screen using the Color Data Register ($2122):

    lda     #%11100000  ; Load the low byte of the green color.
    sta     $2122
    lda     #%00000000  ; Load the high byte of the green color.
    sta     $2122

==== Step 3: Ending VBlank ====

We end the VBlank by turning the screen back on and setting the brightness to 15, again using the Screen Display Register ($2100):

    lda     #%00001111  ; End VBlank, setting brightness to 15 (100%).
    sta     $2100

=== Ending the program ===

Unlike many computer programs, SNES programs aren't really designed to end.  SNES games are intended to keep running until the user turns the system off or presses reset.  In our case, though, the SNES has done all that we wanted it to do, and now we would like it to sit still and not change anything.  We accomplish this with an infinite loop:

     ; Loop forever.
 Forever:
     jmp Forever

If we didn't have this loop at the end, the SNES would start executing any code or data that happened to follow our program, which may make the SNES do something that we didn't intend.

Alternatively, we also could've used the &quot;STP&quot; command. This command stalls the SNES' CPU until the console is reset.  The endless loop is a good practice, though, because eventually we'll need a main program loop, and that is what this will become.

== Assembling the ROM ==

Once we have our program in a file -- let's call it &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.asm&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; -- we want to assemble it into a ROM image, so that we can run it in an emulator.  First, we execute the WLA 65816 assembler to turn the assembly file into an object file:

 wla-65816 -vo Greenspace.asm Greenspace.obj

This should create the object file &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.obj&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

Then, we need to link the object file into a ROM.  The WLA linker requires a link file that lists the files to be linked.  We'll make one called &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.link&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; with the following contents:

 [objects]
 Greenspace.obj 

Then, all we need to do is to execute the WLA linker:

 wlalink -vr Greenspace.link Greenspace.smc

This should create the ROM image &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.smc&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, which we can then run in an emulator.

To make the compile and link steps easier to run repeatedly -- as we might want to do when alternating between editing and testing -- we can put the commands in a [[w:en:Shell script|shell script]], &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.bat&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; in DOS/Windows, or &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for UNIX.

 wla-65816 -vo Greenspace.asm Greenspace.obj
 wlalink -vr Greenspace.link Greenspace.smc

If you use UNIX you need to add ''#!/bin/bash'' as the first line of the file. Under Windows, it's a good idea to add ''@echo off'' as the first line.

Alternatively, if you are on a UNIX-based platform, it is possible to create a makefile and use the [[w:en:make_(software)|make]] utility. To do this, create a file named &quot;&lt;tt&gt;makefile&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

 Greenspace.smc: Greenspace.asm Greenspace.link
     wla-65816 -vo Greenspace.asm Greenspace.obj
     wlalink -vr Greenspace.link Greenspace.smc

After creating this file, simply use the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; command, and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.smc&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; will be created.

Building and maintaining this cookbook requires work, some of which is tedious. It is good to pitch in, doing your part to take care of things. Here are some of the many things you can do.

==Stop spammers and vandals==
Notice the &quot;[[Special:RecentChanges|Recent changes]]&quot; link in the left sidebar. You can use this to see the most recent modifications. There is a drop down menu near the top of the list that lets you select a specific namespace.  Choose the &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace, and click the go button.

Now you can see all the recent cookbook edits. You can revert an edit by going to the page history, choosing the most recent good version, editing ''that'' version (note the warning you'll see), and saving the result. If you are fairly sure that the bad edit was intentionally bad, get an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|admin]] to block the user. You can report problems in the [[WB:AA|administrative assistance reading room]].

==Nominate and judge potential editors==
[[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|Requests for permissions]] require votes. Without votes, progress will tend to be slow. Without editors, the vandals and spammers run wild. If you see a user who appears fit to be an editor, you should nominate them on that page. While there, vote for all the candidates that seem decent to you.

==Add pictures for ingredients and tools==
See [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] for where the pictures are or should be.  Start at [[commons:Category:Food|Category:Food]] as a first place to look, but some images may not be properly categorized.

Many US government sites are excellent sources of public domain (no copyright) pictures. You can use Google image search with the site:gov option to find these. To be more specific, site:usda.gov or site:fda.gov can be used. Use site:mil for military sites (as the military does serve food). In general, do not use these photos for recipes. After you find an appropriate image, upload it either here or at Commons, and add it to the pages.

==Add pictures for recipes==
For recipes, you really should cook the food. For example, this cookbook has two lemon meringue pie recipes. The pies look and taste different from each other, although they are similar. It would be bad to use a generic picture from an unknown recipe. As above, images can be stored at the Wikimedia [[commons:|Commons]] to make images available for all Wikimedia Foundation projects, or uploaded to Wikibooks for cookbook-only use. 

When taking pictures, try to use something other than a yellowish 60W light bulb and Xenon flash. Natural sunlight, GE Reveal bulbs, and most plant (greenhouse) lights will work well, especially if you can hold the camera steady and suppress the flash. Try to show both the inside and outside of foods where this would be applicable. Cropping the image would be a good idea; use the jpegtran program with the lossless-crop option if you have it.

==Standardize formatting and add links==
All cookbook pages should have links at the top to various parent-like pages, with the [[Cookbook]] link itself at the left. For simplicity and aesthetic reasons, separate these links with the &quot;'''|'''&quot; symbol. Add category links at the bottom of the page. Use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' if you need to keep pictures from spilling into the wrong section. Use a bullet list for ingredients, and a numbered list for the procedure. Link most alcoholic drinks into the [[Bartending]] guide instead of into the [[Cookbook]]. Link all ingredients the first time they are used. Also do this for [[Cookbook:Units of measurement|units of measurement]] and the less-well-known [[Cookbook:Equipment|equipment]]. 

The casing for book titles should match that of Wikibook's scheme for titles, that is, title-case (e.g. &quot;'''F'''ish and '''C'''hips&quot;).  Keeping page names in sentence-case violates Wikibook's page naming convention, see the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|manual of style]].  To make linking easier, [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|redirect pages]] should be created, so links to either title appear as &quot;blue&quot; active links, and duplicate pages are not created.  At least one contributor prefers actions (&quot;Boil'''ing'''&quot;, not &quot;Boil&quot; or &quot;Boiled&quot;) in gerund form. They also advocate keeping ingredient lists in lower-case.

==Help describe and rate the recipes==
Many recipes are poorly described. Beginning cooks can not imagine what the result is supposed to be like. You can describe the food right at the top of the recipe. You can discuss your cooking attempts on the recipe's talk page. If you are able to compute Calories accurately, you might do so. It would be helpful to assign difficulty levels and total preparation times.

==Convert units==
Leave the original [[:Category:Units of measurement|units]] as they are, whatever they may be, and add the new units in parentheses after them. Unit conversion requires more care than most people expect. A &quot;Large&quot; [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] in the USA is about the same as a &quot;size M&quot; egg in the EU; you should remove the size indication if you believe it refers to one of these normal sizes. The USA uses Queen Anne units, while Britain uses imperial (and metric) units. Imperial units are generally about 20% larger than Queen Anne units, so look for signs of a non-USA recipe author (based on [[Cookbook:International food terms|food terms]] and spelling) before you convert the units. Be aware of the distinction between [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (mass or weight) and [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]]. Proportion is important: if you convert 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] as 2 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] then use 4 mL for 1 t and 190 mL for 1 c, but if you convert 1/2 t as 3 mL then use 6 mL for 1 t and 285 mL for 1 c. Adjust the pan size, serving count, and eggs (ouch) as required to match.

==Get junk pages deleted, and save the legit pages==
Simply add '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Delete|your reason goes here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to the top of any page that no reasonable person might want to keep. If there has been significant human effort put into the page, you should instead place the page up for a [[WB:RFD|deletion vote]] and use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{RFD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to mark the page. At the [[WB:RFD]] page, you can also vote on other pages that have been put up for a deletion vote. Be sure to vote based on the quality of the page; for example a vegetarian should take care to vote in favor of something like the [[Cookbook:Beef]] page in spite of any personal disgust at the concept of eating beef.

==Link from Wikipedia to the Cookbook==
Many topics (recipe, ingredient, tool, activity) discussed here in the Cookbook are also covered in [[w:Main_page|Wikipedia]]. From a page over there, you can link to a cookbook page called '''Cookbook:Whatever''' by using '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookbookpar|Whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to make the link. You might best do this at the very top of an &quot;External links&quot; section; the result will be a box on the right side of the page.

==Main Page content==
The Featured Recipe and Featured Ingredient on the main [[Cookbook]] page should be updated regularly.  If the current recipe and ingredient have been up for over a week, feel free to find replacements.  If the featured content has been updated recently and you find a good module for the front page, add the module to either [[:Category:Featured recipe candidate]] or [[:Category:Featured ingredient candidate]], for future consideration.

When replacing featured content, modules with an appropriate photograph should receive higher priority.  Recipes without a photograph can use the five dot difficulty image instead. Create the one paragraph blurb in the templates ([[Template:Featured recipe]] and [[Template:Featured ingredient]]), using content from the module if it is available, and add the pages to [[:Category:Featured recipes]] and [[:Category:Featured ingredients]], while removing any candidate categories.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Confections|Confectionery]]

This recipe describes how to make home-made ''Marshmallows''. They can be used in [[:Category:Marshmallow recipes|any recipe that calls for marshmallows]].
 
==Ingredients==
*About 1 cup confectioners' sugar 
*3 1/2 envelopes (2 tablespoons plus 2 1/2 teaspoons) unflavored gelatin 
*1/2 cup cold water 
*2 cups granulated sugar 
*1/2 cup light corn syrup 
*1/2 cup hot water (about 115 degrees) 
*1/4 teaspoon salt 
*2 large egg whites 
*1 teaspoon vanilla extract

==Procedure==
#Oil bottom and sides of a 13 by 9 by 2-inch rectangular metal baking pan and dust bottom and sides with some confectioners' sugar.
#In bowl of standing electric mixer or in a large bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let stand to soften.
#In a 3-quart heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar, corn syrup, hot water, and salt over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to moderate and boil mixture, without stirring, until a candy or digital thermometer registers 240 degrees, about 12 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour sugar mixture over gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved.
#With standing or a hand-held electric mixer beat mixture on high speed until white, thick and nearly tripled in volume, about 6 minutes if using standing mixer or about 10 minutes if using hand-held mixer. In a large bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites (or reconstituted powdered whites) until they just hold stiff peaks. Beat whites and vanilla into sugar mixture until just combined. Pour mixture into baking pan and sift 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over top. Chill marshmallow, uncovered, until firm, at least three hours, and up to 1 day.
#Run a thin knife around edges of pan and invert pan onto large cutting board. Lifting up 1 corner of inverted pan, with fingers loosen marshmallow and let drop onto cutting board. With a large knife trim edges of marshmallow and cut marshmallows into roughly 1-inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and add marshmallows in batches, tossing to evenly coat.

==Variation==
Coat with toasted coconut or cocoa powder instead of powdered sugar.

      <comment>/* Slapping And Popping */ removing redundant information related to the two previously removed links.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Bass guitars have similar design features to other types of guitar but scaled up: thicker strings, longer neck and larger body, etc. This allows lower notes to be created when the strings are tuned to a playable tension. They are sometimes categorized as guitars but are also occasionally categorized as a separate instrument. Although there are many variations, the standard bass guitar has four strings tuned EADG, one octave lower than the bottom four strings of a guitar in standard tuning. Although the bass guitar can be played like an oversized guitar, it also draws much inspiration from double basses and the instrument has a vocabulary of playing styles and music all of its own.

== Slapping And Popping ==
One of the distinguishing features of the bass guitar is the slap style. It is typically distinct to the bass guitar, although it has been used on acoustic guitars by skillful players.

Slapping is accomplished by percussively striking the string - usually E or A on a standard tuned bass - with the left hand side of the thumb (for a right-handed player). This is done towards the neck of the bass. The thumb is then pulled away as quickly as possible, to create a distinct, &quot;fretty&quot; noise.

Popping is accomplished by curling the fingertip of the index or middle finger under the string - usually the D or G string. The string is then plucked to create a similar sound to slapping on the thicker strings. This is, again, performed towards the neck of the bass.
*[http://www.howtoslapbass.com/slap-bass-tutorial/?=wiki Slap Bass Tutorial Video (Free)]

== Different Basses ==
The &quot;standard&quot; bass is a 4 string bass, tuned EADG (low to high). Other variations of this tuning include DADG and CGCF. These lower tunings are often used in metal and heavier music, as they extend the instrument's range lower.  Altering the tuning of a bass to a lower range (or any other fretted instrumented) by reducing string tension can cause problems that new players should be aware of: looser strings are more prone to &quot;fret buzz&quot;, in which a string rattles on the fretboard, producing a sound that is usually unwanted.  Loosening strings also alters the tension on the neck, which can lead to warping the neck.

To achieve a clear tone on notes lower than standard tuning, a standard 5-string bass adds a low B string, with the bass normally tuned BEADG (low to high).  It is also common to restring a 4-string bass as BEAD, leaving off the high G.  There exist strings that go even lower in range, however these are typically found only on specialty instruments.

==Bass Runs==
Bass runs are particularly nice sounding. For example if one wants to change from a C chord to an Am chord, they could do a nifty bass run.

&lt;pre&gt;

 --C chord--                                       --Am Chord--

 ===========     ==&gt;      ===========      ==&gt;     ===========

== Coordination ==

Coordination may be defined as the process of managing dependencies between activities (Malone &amp; Crowstone, 1994). The need for coordination arises from the fact that literally all organizations are a complex aggregation of diverse systems, which need to work or be operated in concert to produce desired outcomes. To simplify the picture, one could decompose an organization into three broad components of actors, goals and resources. The actors, comprising of entities such as management, employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders perform interdependent activities aimed at achieving certain goals. To perform these activities, the actors require various types of inputs or resources. As explained later in the paper the inputs may themselves be interdependent in the ways that they are acquired, created or used. The goals to which the actors aspire are also diverse in nature. Some of them will be personal while others are corporate. Even where the goals are corporate, they address different sets of stakeholders and may be in conflict. 

Calls for coordination are evident is situations where a) temporality is a factor, such that effects of delays or of future consequences of today’s decisions are not immediately apparent b) there is a large number of actors c) there is a large number interactions between actors or tasks in the system or d) where combinations or occurrences in the system involve an aspect of probability (stochastic variability). In summary, the more complex the system (and organizations are complex aggregations) the more coordination is necessary.

Multiple actors and interactions, resources and goals need to be coordinated if common desired outcomes are to be achieved. Viewed from the need to maintain perspective and solve problems that might arise from these multiplicities, coordination links hand in glove with the concept of systems thinking.

In contrast to traditional methods of problem analysis, system thinking focuses on how a component of a system under study interacts with other constituents of the same system (Aronson, 1998). Organizations are systems in the sense that they comprise of elements that interact to produce a predetermined behavior or output. Traditional analysis approaches focus on isolating individual parts. The systems thinking approach instead works by expanding the analytical spectrum to take into account the broader picture of how the constituent parts of the system interact with each other. Change in a constituent part of a system may constrain efficient functioning of other parts of the same system or alter required input or output specifications. Others, especially resources, may need to be used in combination to achieve desired changes. The point here is that looking at small parts of an interacting system involving multiple actors, resources and goals may accentuate a problem that analysis seeks to solve. Coordination, in a systems thinking approach fashion is called for.

Crowstone (1998) refers to coordination theory as “a still developing body of theories about how coordination can occur in diverse kinds of systems. According to this theory, actors in organizations are faced with coordination problems. Coordination problems are a consequence of dependencies in the organization that constrain the efficiency of task performance. Dependencies may be inherent in the structure of the organization (for example, departments of a university college interact with each other, constraining the changes that can be made to a single department without interfering with the efficient functioning of the other departments) or dependences may result from processes - task decomposition or allocation to actors and resources (for example, professors teaching complementary courses face constraints on the kind of changes they can make without interfering with the functioning of each other).

The solution to coordination problems, according to coordination theory, lies in the actors performing additional activities called coordination mechanisms. A professor who wishes to change a course module must check if the changes will affect other courses in the department and other departments in the college. The theory maintains that dependences and mechanisms to counter them are general in the sense that they arise in one form or another in nearly every organization. The theory this makes a recommendation that it is essential to identify and study dependences in a system and their related coordination mechanisms before decisions are made or action taken. Actors must also realize that there are several mechanisms to manage a dependency each of which may result in different processes. The ideal one should be based on situational factors and often involves trade offs. To summarize, an organization considering change (or an organization in the process of formation) ought to first identify inherent dependences and coordination problems likely to be faced and then choose from alternatives the coordination mechanism that best achieves the desired goals in the circumstances (Crowstone, 1998). A key point here is that coordination mechanisms are variable parts of the organization system and that choice of a specific mechanism has consequences for efficiency and goal achievement.

A simplified typology of the kind of dependences that call for coordination in an organization may be: 
a) Task-task:
o	Tasks may have overlapping, conflicting or outputs with the same characteristics;
o	Common inputs for tasks may be shareable, reusable or non-reusable
o	The output of one task may be the input of other tasks or a prerequisite for performing subsequent tasks. There may be conflict in specifications that need coordination.
b) Task-resource i.e. resources required by a task
c) Resource-resource: a situation in which one resource depends on another resource. 
Each of these dependences requires an appropriate coordination mechanism to manage it.

In conclusion, solution to organizational problems, implementation of change or formation of a new organization involves the management of numerous dependences among tasks, resources and goals. Dependences are best managed by coordination of the dependent parties. The choice of a specific coordination mechanism results in a unique organizational form and/or processes that have consequences for achievement of organizational goals. Coordination is a constituent application of systems thinking in the sense that it requires an organization wide examination in how a change in one component of the organization affects other components of the same system. The aim of coordination is not new; improvement of performance is a universal organizational goal. Approaching the task from a broad perspective differs from the traditional mechanisms of analysis i.e. breaking down the problem into small parts. Finally focusing on dependences and coordination mechanisms is not a one-time effort. For organizations in dynamic environments, it is a recurring theme.

'''Grotten Hans''' is a recipe that has been called a big dumpling but is basically steamed sweet bread.  The recipe was traditional in the German areas of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/archrecipes/index.cgi?cat=German-Russian NDSU Recipe Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
*¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|c]]. [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 c. [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ c. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 [[Cookbook:egg|eggs]], beaten
*3 c. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
# Cream lard, sugar and salt.  Add eggs. Mix flour and baking powder.  
# Add this flour mixture to the lard mixture alternatively with the milk. Mix well.  
# Pour into a well-greased 2-pound coffee can.  A piece of wax paper on the bottom of the can works well.  Cover with foil, and tie this on with a string.  
# Set this tin into a large kettle of hot water several (3) inches deep.  This will steam the dumpling.  Cook for 2 hours.  The old way was to dip a towel in hot water, then cold water, then sprinkle with flour.  
# Pour dumpling onto towel and tie up.  Drop into boiling water and cook 2 hours.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Raisin Sauce:
*2 c. [[Cookbook:raisin|raisins]]
*2 c. [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 scant tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*½ c. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

Mix raisins, water, lemon juice, cinnamon and sugar.  Simmer for 1 hour.  Thicken with cornstarch. Serve over Grotten Hans.  Cherry sauce is nice also.

Serve with ham.

== Discussion from [[Talk:Getting a date]] ==

===Deletion discussion (Kept, no consensus to delete)===

'''Keep and Edit''' Most of the material is indeed unvarifiable and not easily scientifically proven, however it is usefull. Many of the techniques in social research indeed is controversial. Neverthelsess keep it and rather than deleting it allow it to remain and fix itself so that the most fundamental principles can surface themselves. Original, finished work should go to [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikisource]. Wikibooks is a place to develop books.

My main concern right now is that it is not presented as a book or as a guide, but more or an encyclopedia entry. To be truly usefull as a book, textbook or a guide which it claims to be, it must be writen from the perspective or &quot;how&quot; versus the present &quot;what&quot;. We are not talking about what it is, we are talking about how to do it. Let's stop asking what it can do for me and start asking how I can make it better.

--[[User:Seductionreport.com|Seductionreport.com]] 06:57, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

Some parts of this book seem to be similar to the now-deleted Getting a Girl. (See [[/Archive]]). The other parts seem like a simple joke. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 21:52, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
* If you were following the earlier VfD discussion, the current book grew out of that debate.  Rather than fixing the old book in place, the current book(s) were created out of an NPOV'ed subset of the old content.  I was the one who NPOV'ed and moved it; I am certainly not one of the original authors, and the subject matter doesn't interest me much.  However, I think that we should be having the difficult and serious discussion about whether such a book is appropriate for Wikibooks, not whether poorly-written or highly POV content belongs here (it doesn't!).  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:24, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
** As for my take on keeping or deleting it, I think the content has the potential to be useful, neutral, and presented in the form of a textbook; I also think it could be an enjoyable read, along the lines of the many self-help books published on the subject.  I have conflicting thoughts about what Wikibooks content should encompass, but my current thoughts on the matter lend themselves to a '''weak keep'''.  Pages that induced me to try to salvage the previous book were [[Getting_a_girl (for guys)/Appearance|Appearance]] and [[Getting a girl (for guys)/Dating ideas|Dating ideas]].  --[[User:Sj|Sj]]

'''Keep''' Some people really do need all the help they can get. Maybe not you. Have some pity on fellow human beings who are struggling to satisfy one of life's most basic needs.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:14, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

'''Comment''' To be fair, they authors seem to have tried to address the bias towards straight men by adding three other sections. It also now uses subpages so it isn't polluting the main namespace like the old one was. I'm no longer sure about this so please do not count me listing this page as a vote either way. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 23:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' I'm kind of curious to see where this book goes, and I'm amused by what's already in there (its predecessor, [[Getting a girl]], was extremely funny), but I see nothing in the book so far that indicates that it's going to be more than people's random ideas and suggestions that they've thought about over the years, none of which is scientific, verifiable, and much of which is bound to be contradictory.  The very nature of what has been written thus far indicates, to me, that the book has about zero chance of being useful to anybody, or worse, that anyone taking the book seriously will be as likely to be harmed by its contents as helped. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 21:43, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:By that argument, the Cookbook needs to go too. The recipes are all nothing more than people's random ideas and suggestions that they've thought about over the years, none of which is scientific, verifiable, and much of which is bound to be contradictory. This &quot;Getting a data&quot; book would have been damn useful to me 15 years ago. Have some pity, will you? Many of your fellow humans are suffering. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:34, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:: &lt;[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 21:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)&gt; If the book were renamed &quot;tips on how to get a date,&quot; then sure, it would be an appropriate resource for various ideas about dating, kind of like a cookbook, or really, tips on any subject, and there would be no need for it to be scientific.  Also, a recipe book is rarely contradictory: each recipe is a particular means to its own end (i.e., incapable of contradicting other recipes, because recipes by their very nature do not need to contain general principles about cooking--any such information is beyond its scope), and any internal contradictions within a recipe can quickly be spotted.  Additionally, a recipe book is also quite verifiable.  If someone follows the recipe, and gets a pile of grey goo when they were expecting an eclair, then they will know that something was either wrong with their ability to follow the instructions, or with the recipe itself.  The wiki philosophy can and will (over time) sort out any recipes that produce results that differ from the expectations set forth in the recipe.  The ideas set forth in &quot;getting a girl/date,&quot; however, are not verifiable, and where the results differ from what is written, the error can scarcely be traced to a particular element wrong in the instructions or in the execution of the instructions.  The wiki philosophy simply doesn't work for such casual advice: we cannot asymptotically arrive at &quot;truth,&quot; because there is no truth to arrive at--just a shitload of unverifiable conjecture.  What you would have found helpful 15 years ago could easily cause another person great distress now, and not simply because they failed to follow the clear and precise instructions.
*:: In addition to these general issues, I have some problems with the specifics of how this book is being approached.  To begin with, the book seems to frequently rely on the premise that a girl can be &quot;gotten.&quot;  In many cases, a given man will be incapable of &quot;getting&quot; a particular girl, and following the instructions set forth will essentially further his transformation into an obsessive, determined maniac that will find himself presented with a restraining order.  Also, most principles around &quot;getting a girl&quot; are largely dependent on context, and yet no attempt is made to clarify this, or to establish which principles are general ones, which are applicable only to specific contexts (and to what contexts they are applicable), and which might be applicable to many, but not all contexts.  The problem here is that people are only familiar with the contexts to which they've been exposed, and are not suited for giving advice to another person in differing circumstances.
*:: Consider this ridiculous piece of advice: &quot;A girl likes to know that you would fight for her honor and to keep her safe (whether she can defend herself or not).&quot;  While this may have been useful information to a particular person in every (potential or otherwise) dating situation they've been in (though in such a case, I suspect that there are some problems with that person's analysis of those situations), there are also many scenarios in which this outmoded idea (and any behavior that follows from it) is totally inapplicable.  Yet the book presents it as a general statement, with no explication regarding what circumstances it might be true in, and with no explanation of what sort of knowledge or expertise the author has that he might be able to give such advice, and no reference to any data (solid or otherwise) that is capable of supporting this.  Any claim that the author simply &quot;knows this to be true&quot; is simply bullshit--a single person's experience, no matter how broad or deep, cannot establish profound knowledge of the human condition in general.  The best we could hope for is that this piece of information is based on international surveys, statistical analysis, and years of experimentation through relationship therapy--in which case this information would then provide us with certain types of contexts and scenarios for which the information is appropriate (which is certainly not all of them), and it would certainly be much more detailed.
*:: That sample piece of advice is not unusual within the text of the book as it stands.  The entire book is written in the same way.  '''My vote stands'''.&lt;/[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]]&gt;
*:: Comment: this book is not a form of pity, it is a form of &quot;kicking them while they're down,&quot; if anything. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]]
*:::I see. The problem is that the book is not politically correct. The example you present (able and willing to keep her safe) is in no way outmoded... even if many woman won't admit it to themselves. It will be outmoded perhaps some day, after about a million years of future human evolution. The premise that &quot;getting a girl&quot; via pursuit is possible is mostly true as well, and it is something I wish I'd understood about 15 years ago. It sure did work for my step-sister-in-law's husband, who is now married to the woman of his dreams. Tradition still works, surprisingly well in fact. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:41, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:::: That is not a matter of political correctness.  I am not as concerned about the offensiveness of the content (as some others are) as I am the inaccuracy, invalidity, and purely speculative qualities of the information.  You have given evidence of this with your attempts to back up the information using purely information from your own life (which is necessarily incomplete data, the sort of which does not belong in this book--and if the book is to be composed entirely or even mostly of this information, then it does not belong in wikibooks). [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 00:13, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*::::: I see no such requirement for wikibooks. The wikipedia entry for wikibooks says &quot;manuals, and other texts&quot;, but says nothing about prohibiting the humanities. This sure counts as a manual. It also might actually get used... the idea of a wiki &quot;book&quot; being used to teach a serious college science course is just laughable. A guide to getting women doesn't need to be stable and well-organized over an entire semester. In other words, it's perfect for a wiki. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:39, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:::::: On the contrary, what is &quot;perfect for a wiki&quot; are books containing information that can be repeated (if it is providing instructions, as in a cookbook), verified, and improved by the community.  This, on the other hand, only contains speculation and opinions that are lumped one on the other (with some of the most awful poetic phrasings), without any truth that can be arrived at.  There are some experimental ideas out there about creating fiction or art on a wiki, or other such contributional work that has no truth to arrive at, but wikibooks is not one of those projects.  The idea of a wiki &quot;book&quot; being used to teach a serious college science course is not at all laughable, it just happens to be something of a distant hope at this point in time.  All of the wiki projects are long-term projects, and even the most mature one: the English wikipedia, is not a terrible good reference as of yet.  All indications are that it will be in time, however--or that it will be good enough for most people, most of the time.&quot; [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 02:50, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*::::::: The guide for getting women actually does have truth that can be verified and improved upon. The methods may differ from what you are familiar with. One simple way things could work would be for people to mark tactics as they succeed or fail. Any variations caused by situation are experimental error, just as in any science. In time, each method will have a success rate associated with it, with accuracy according to how often the method was attempted. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:39, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:::::::: That, my friend, is a contentious and non-neutral point of view, as is everything I've read within the text about which we are arguing. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 20:30, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*I've asked for Jimbo Wales' opinion, as it's not in anybody's interests for him to find out about this months later and delete it. See [[w:User_talk:Jimbo Wales#b:Getting a date]]. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 00:52, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' noticed [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] comment to Jimbo and thought I would read it and add my two cents. Seems worthy of keeping and seeing what will happen. [[User:Trödel|Trödel]]

*'''Delete''' This is not a textbook and the &quot;advice&quot; is unhelpful and simplistic. I don't think any scholarship will ever make its way to this module, either. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:35, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:: The advice is helpful, particularly regarding mindset and overcoming fear. It would be easy to improve this book. Doing so while a vote for deletion hangs over it is not exactly fun. (yeah right, people are going to contribute to something under threat of being destroyed) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

*Jimbo has suggested that this book should be moved to [[w:Wikicities]]. Would the proponents of this book be happy with that as a compromise?
*:Hmmm, this is more of a textbook than the [[Cookbook]], which really does need to move to it's own domain. So I might like the cookbook to move, pending some study of server reliability and capacity. The Getting_a_date book does really seem to belong on wikibooks, fitting in rather decently with both the stated mission and the various structural restrictions imposed by a shared wiki. The cookbook on the other hand, has outgrown a shared wiki and has no need for the proposed linearization-to-paper enhancements that this wiki might be getting. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:42, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' The textbook, while currently somewhat simplistic, is no worse than a lot of other books out there. If people attempt to follow the advice in there and come back with their experiences, it would improve in a controlled manner. I see nothing sacred in this subject; it is probably a craft that can be learned by a dedicated student. The argument that people will get hurt is silly: If you engage in dating (or life) you will get hurt. most likely. That is the price of the game. If you followed the advice in the book, at least you have something to blame :)

(Edit: I think many parts of the current version deals with not only dating, but with psychology (fear), health (diet) and interaction skills in general so I believe there are a lot of interesting information in it even if its not about dating.

*'''Keep''' the most apeal of Wiki-everything comes from that it is-not-a-paper thing, simplistic no problem there are peole needing simplistic advice, other guys and gals can click throught by the time the book grows, this book can be left here, if there is any joke parts of it they can be fixed. Anyway I admit this book for me is a great way to indulge my extravert part, by examining other peoples view on this subject in every simplistic detail.''The Getting a girl'' had many problems beyond title.~~Gnomz007 from Wikipedia

=== Deletion discussion here instead of at [[WB:VFD]] ===
&lt;s&gt;This discussion is interesting, but I missed it, instead posting at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. I would think that this discussion is too biased in favor of the book, because of its location. Use the VFD page so that the entire Wikibooks community can discuss it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Sorry, that was February 2005, now it is November 2005. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:21, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

== Discussion from [[Talk:Getting a girl (for guys)]] ==

I'm confused. I read on the vote for deletion page that this book was to be deleted, yet it has not only been re-created, but has forked into 4 different books. Am I mis-understanding something here?
: I believe you are.  The book was npov'ed, content was removed, other neutral content was added, and the book was properly identified as &quot;getting a date&quot; for only one of the four most common sexual orientations and circumstances.  This was done after discussion with Jimbo and others involved with the previous debates.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:29, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:This book is good, but it's got a few bad features: It's written from the first person, it's not NPOV, it's somewhat America-centric, or at least Western-hemisphere-centric. It needs a lot of work, but it has a right to existance. The dating ideas are a good repository! --wp:is:Spm

Double Your Dating ? Why do we have that there, if we are having external links 
can we seperate them into commercial and non-commercial sites David DeAngelo 
is well known on the internet for his dating books , but I don't think this is the place
for it though, does anyone agree?  If we put up david's material 
whats to stop us putting out all the other seduction/pickup
stuff that's out there ? --aUserOnline

== Discussion from [[Talk:Getting a guy (for girls)]] ==

=== Additions after my proximity edit ===

I bet those were all made by women, still mystified by what men want.  I tell ya, it ''is'' that simple. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 14:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[Guide to Social Activity]] ==

I have not edited every submodule, but I unilaterally decided to move [[Getting a date]] to [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]]. Explanation:
# [[Getting a date]] was nominated for cleanup, yet there was no recent work on it.
# I wanted to write [[Guide to Social Activity/Alcohol]] and decided that alcohol and courtship belong in the same book.
# Users have threatened [[Getting a date]] with deletion, despite efforts to improve it. I wanted to continue these efforts to improve it.
# [[Getting a date]] was unnecessarily divided four ways, depending on the gender of the participants. There is not much difference between a man with a woman, and a woman with a man, so I decided to combine them.
# The book contained mostly advice for dating, but I think that it should contain additional material, such as a description and history of dating.
--[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:20, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;I want to merge in [[Getting a boy]], but [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]] is at votes for deletion, and [[Getting a boy]] is not a deletion candidate. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:38, 1 December 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Since [[Getting a boy]] is now a deletion candidate, and seems useless, I have voted to delete it and removed the proposal to merge it here.

=== Problems while improving the Courtship module ===

I am trying to fix [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]] (formerly [[Getting a date]]). The three major improvements are:
# ''Establish gender-neutrality.'' Some persons claim that the old version was [[wikt:sexist|sexist]]; I think that the module should be gender-neutral. The information, in most cases, is as applicable to a man and a woman as to the other three cases.
# ''Establish verifiable information.'' By finding Wikipedia or Internet links, I can use these to determine whether the usefulness of the existing content. (I have already removed some of the existing content that I expect not to try and verify.)
# ''Broaden scope of some modules.'' Some modules are doing poorly, and improvements would probably broaden their scope from courtship to social activity in general.

I have made not much actual progress for this. Most of what I tried so far was to establish gender-neutrality. In particular, sometimes I am trying to provide general information, and sometimes I am trying to write a how-to. I might need to make another module first, perhaps [[Guide to Social Activity/Alcohol]], and use it as a module for Courtship. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:30, 9 December 2005 (UTC)


== I miss Rock 'n roll ==
This dating site is too sweet and christian. It only takes in account the stereotype relationships without taking the reality into account that all people are different. There is no atention for gays and lesbians. There is no atention for the bad boys and the fact that girls tend to like bad boys. 'Showing respect for everybody you meets' sounds like bullshit to me. I don't like the rolemodels that girls should let the boys ask them out and that boys should be protective. We have just witnessed 50 years of attempts to create freedom. Must we go back to the days in which half of the population was not able to find happyness in a relationship. I think this whole guide should be nominated for deletion.

:I found it through a Wikipedia article of the same name. All I have to say is that for something as fundamental as a relationship, it is impossible to make a gender-neutral article. I'm a very left-wing liberal, but for a topic that is the reason for gender you just cannot treat it like that. While I respect the fact that it doesn't always have to be the guy who asks the girl out or that it doesn't even have to be a guy and a girl at all, I think that you have to accept the fact that women and men interact differently and it would make more sense to have situation based guides for each that allow for the reader to be either a leader of follower. --[[User:64.148.27.99|64.148.27.99]] 02:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

''O would that all were truly Christian! It is easy to be a Christian on the tongue, but hard to be a true one. Today [1910] some five hundred million souls are Christian, but the real Christian is very rare: he is that soul from whose comely face there shineth the splendour of Christ; and who showeth forth the perfections of the Kingdom; this is a matter of great moment, for to be a Christian is to embody every excellence there is.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often, in experiments with finite sample spaces, the outcomes are equiprobable.
In such cases, the probability of an event amounts to the number of outcomes comprising this event divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.
While counting outcomes may appear straightforward, it is in many circumstances a daunting task.
For example, consider the number of distinct subsets of the integers {1, 2, ... , n} that do not contain two consecutive integers.
This number is equal to

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \phi^{n+2} - (1 - \phi)^{n+2} }{ \sqrt{5} } ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2&lt;/math&gt; is the ''golden ratio''.
It can also be obtained recursively through the ''Fibonacci'' recurrence relation.

Calculating the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed is part of the field of ''combinatorics''.
In this section, we introduce useful counting techniques that can be applied to situations pertinent to probability theory.

==The Counting Principle==

'''The Fundamental Rule of Counting'''  
If a set of choices or trials, T1, T2, T3, …, Tk, could result, respectively, in n1, n2, n3, …,nk possible outcomes, the entire set of k choices or trials has n1×n2×n3× … ×nk possible outcomes. (The numbers n1, n2, n3, …, nk cannot depend on which outcomes actually occur.) 

By the Fundamental Rule of Counting, the total number of possible sequences of choices is 5×4×3×2×1 = 120 sequences. Each sequence is called a permutation of the five items. A permutation of items is an ordering of the items. More generally, by the Fundamental Rule of Counting, in ordering n things, there are n choices for the first, (n-1) choices for the second, etc., so the total number of ways of ordering a total of n things is 
n × (n-1) × (n-2) × . . . × 1. This product, n×(n-1)×(n-2)× . . . ×1, is written n!, which is pronounced &quot;n factorial.&quot; By convention, 0! = 1

The counting principle is the guiding rule for computing the number of elements in a cartesian product as well.

&lt;math&gt;
S \times T = \{ (x, y) | x \in S \wedge y \in T \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The number of elements in the cartesian product S x T is equal to mn.
Note that the total number of outcomes does not depend on the order in which the experiments are realized.

[[Image:countingprinciple.png]]

'''Example:'''
Consider an experiment consisting of flipping a coin and rolling a die.
There are two possibilities for the coin, heads or tails, and the die has six sides.
The total number of outcomes for this experiment is 2 x 6 = 12.
That is, there are twelve outcomes for the roll of a die followed by the toss of a coin: 1H, 1T, 2H, 2T, 3H, 3T, 4H, 4T, 5H, 5T, 6H, 6T.


The counting principle can be extended to compute the number of elements in the cartesian product of multiple sets.
Consider the finite sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_r&lt;/math&gt; and their cartesian product

&lt;math&gt;
S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_r
= \left\{ (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_r) | s_p \in S_p \right\} .
&lt;/math&gt;

If we denote the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;S_p&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n_p = | S_p |&lt;/math&gt;, then the number of distinct ordered r-tuples of the form &lt;math&gt;(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_r)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n = n_1 n_2 \cdots n_r&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example - Sampling with Replacement and Ordering:'''
An urn contains n balls numbered 1 through n.
A ball is drawn from the urn, and its number is recorded on an ordered list.
The ball is then replaced in the urn.
This procedure is repeated k times.
We wish to compute the number of possible sequences that results from this experiment.
There are k drawings and n possibilities per drawing.
Using the counting principle, we conclude that the number of distinct sequences is
&lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example:'''
The power set of S, denoted by &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all subsets of S.
In set theory, &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of all functions from S to {0, 1}.
By identifying a function in &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; with the corresponding preimage of one, we obtain a bijection between &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; and the subsets of S.
In particular, each function in &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic function of a subset of S.

Suppose that S is finite with n = |S| elements.
For every element of S, a characteristic function in &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; is either zero or one.
There are therefore &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; distinct characteristic functions from S to {0, 1}.
Hence, the number of distinct subsets of S is given by &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Formulae'''
The formula for counting combinations has special cases that are worth memorizing: 
''nC0 = nCn = 1'' (There is only one way to pick no thing and only one way to pick all n things.) 
''nC1 = nCn-1 = n'' (there are n ways to pick one thing or to leave one thing out) 
''nCk = nCn-k'' (There are the same number of ways of picking k of n things as there are of leaving out k of n things)
 
[[Image:powerset.png]]

== Permutations ==
'''Permutation:''' an arrangement of objects without repetition where order is important.
Permutations using all the objects: ''n'' objects, arranged into group size of ''n'' without repetition, and order being important. P(n, n) = N!
Example: Find all permutations of A, B, C

Permutations of some of the objects: ''n'' objects, group size ''r'', order is important. P(n, r) = N!/(n-r)!
Example: Find all 2-letter combinations using letters A, B, C
'''Distinguished permutation:''' if a word has ''n'' letters, ''k'' of which are unique, let ''n'' (n1, n2, n3....nk) be the frequency of each of the ''k'' letters: N!/(n1!)(n2!)(n3!).

Consider the integer set S = {1, 2, ... , n}.
A ''permutation'' of S is an ordered arrangement of its elements, a list without repetitions.
The number of permutations of S can be computed as follows.
The number of distinct possibilities for the first item is n.
The number of possibilities for the second item is n-1, namely all the integers in S except the first element in the list.
Similarly, the number of distinct possibilities for the m-th item is n - m + 1.
This pattern continues until all the elements in S are listed.
Summarizing, we find that the total number of permutations of S is n ''factorial,
n! = n (n-1) ... 1 .

'''Example:'''
We wish to compute the number of permutations of S = {1, 2, 3}.
Since the set S contains three elements, it has 3! = 6 permutations.
They can be listed as 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.

[[Image:permutation.png]]

=== Stirling's Formula ===

The number n! grows very rapidly as a function of n.
A good approximation for n! when n is large is given by Stirling's formula,

&lt;math&gt;
n! \sim n^n e^{-n} \sqrt{ 2 \pi n}
&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
The notation &lt;math&gt;a(n) \sim b(n)&lt;/math&gt; signifies that the ratio a(n)/b(n) approaches one as n tends to infinity.

=== k-Permutations ===

Suppose that we list only k elements out of the set S = {1, 2, ... , n}, where &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.
We wish to count the number of distinct k-permutations of S.
Following our previous argument, we can choose one of n elements to be the first item listed, one of n-1 elements for the second item, and so on.
The procedure terminates when k items have been listed.
The number of possible sequences is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = n (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) .
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:'''
A recently formed music group has four original songs they can play.
They are asked to perform two songs at a music festival.
We wish to compute the number of song arrangements the group can offer in concert.
Abstractly, this is equivalent to computing the number of 2-permutations of four songs.
Thus, the number of distinct arrangements is 4!/2! = 12.

[[Image:kpermutation.png]]

'''Example - Sampling without Replacement, with  Ordering:'''
An urn contains n balls numbered one through n.
A ball is picked from the urn, and its number is recorded on an ordered list.
The ball is not replaced in the urn.
This procedure is repeated until k balls are selected from the urn, where &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.
We wish to compute the number of possible sequences that results from this experiment.
The number of possibilities is equivalent to the number of k-permutations of n elements, which is given by n!/(n-k)!.

== Combinations ==
'''Combinations''': arrangement of objects without repetition, where order is NOT important.
A combination of ''n'' objects, arranged in groups of size ''r'', without repetition, and order being important. C(n, r) = n!/r!(n-r)!
Another way to write a combination of ''n'' things, ''r'' at a time, is using the Binomial notation ('''Binomial Distribution'''). Combinations of this type are referred to verbally as &quot;n choose r&quot;.

Consider the integer set S = {1, 2, ... , n}.
A ''combination'' is a subset of S.
We emphasize that a combination differs from a permutation in that elements in a combination have no specific ordering.
The 2-element subsets of S = {1, 2, 3, 4} are
{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4} ,
whereas the 2-permutations of S are more numerous with
(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4),
(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) .
There are therefore fewer 2-element subsets of S than 2-permutations of S.

[[Image:combination.png]]

We can compute the number of k-element combinations of S = {1, 2, ... , n} as follows.
First, we note that a k-permutation can be formed by first selecting k objects from S and then ordering them.
There are k! distinct ways of ordering k objects.
The number of k-permutations must then equal the number of k-element combinations multiplied by k!.
Since the total number of k-permutations of S is n! / (n-k)!, the number of k-element combinations is found to be

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} = \frac{ n (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) }{ k! } .
&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called a ''binomial coefficient''.
Observe that selecting a k-element subset of S is equivalent to choosing the n-k elements that belong to its complement.

'''Example - Sampling without Replacement or Ordering:'''
An urn contains n balls numbered one through n.
A ball is drawn from the urn and placed in a jar.
This process is repeated until the jar contains k balls, where &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.
We wish to compute the number of distinct combinations the jar can hold after the completion of this experiment.
Because there is no ordering in the jar, this amounts to counting the number of k-element subsets of a given n-element set, which is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Again, let S = {1, 2, ... , n}.
Since a combination is also a subset and the number of k-element combinations of S is &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;, the sum of the binomial coefficients over all values of k must be equal to the number of elements in the power set of S.
Thus, we get

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} = 2^n.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Partitions ==

Abstractly, a combination is equivalent to partitioning a set into two subsets, one containing k objects and the other containing the n-k remaining objects.
In general, the set S = {1, 2, ... , n } can be partitioned into r subsets.
Let &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r&lt;/math&gt; be nonnegative integers such that
'''
&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{p = 1}^r n_p = n.
&lt;/math&gt;'''

Consider the following iterative algorithm that leads to a partition of S.
First, we select a subset of &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; elements from S.
Having chosen the first subset, we select a second subset containing &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; elements from the remaining &lt;math&gt;n - n_1&lt;/math&gt; elements.
We continue this procedure by successively choosing subsets of &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; elements from the remaining &lt;math&gt;n - n_1 - \cdots - n_{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; elements, until no element remains.
This algorithm yields a partition of S into r subsets, with the p-th subset containing exactly &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; elements.

We wish to count the number of such partitions.
We know that there are &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{n_1!(n-n_1)!}&lt;/math&gt; ways to form the first subset.
Examining our algorithm, we see that there are

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(n - n_1 - \cdots - n_{p-1})!}{n_p!(n - n_1 - \cdots - n_p)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

ways to form the p-th subset.
Using the counting principle, the total number of partitions is then given by

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_r!} .
&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called a ''multinomial coefficient''.

'''Example:'''
A die is rolled nine times.
We wish to compute the number of outcomes for which every odd number appears three times.
The number of distinct sequences in which one, three, and five each appear three times is equal to the number of partitions of {1, 2, ... , 9} into three subsets of size three, namely

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{9!}{3! 3! 3!} = 1680 .
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above analysis, we assume that the size of each subset is fixed, three subsets of size three.
Suppose instead that we are interested in counting the number of ways of picking the sizes of the subsets, r subsets of &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r&lt;/math&gt; size, where the sum of the sizes is a constant.
Specifically, we wish to compute the number of ways integers &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r&lt;/math&gt; can be selected such that every integer is nonnegative and

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p = 1}^r n_p = n&lt;/math&gt;.

We can visualize the number of possible assignments as follows.
Picture n balls spaced out on a straight line and consider r-1 vertical markers, each of which can be put between two consecutive balls, before the first ball, or after the last ball. 
For instance, if there are five balls and two markers then one possible assignement is illustrated below.

[[Image:Partitioning.png]]

The number of objects in the first subset corresponds to the number balls before the first marker.
Similarly, the number of objects in the p-th subset is equal to the number of balls between the p-th marker and the preceding one.
Finally, the number of objects in the last subset is simply the number of balls after the last marker.
In the figure, the integer assignment is

&lt;math&gt;
(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (0,2,3).
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Partitioning2.png]]

Two consecutive markers imply that the corresponding subset is empty.
There is a natural bijection between an integer assignment and the graphical representation depicted above.
To count the number of possible integer assignments, it then suffices to compute the number of ways to position the markers and the balls.
In particular, there are n + r - 1 positions, n balls, and r - 1 markers.
The number of ways to assign the markers is equal to the number of n-combinations of n + r - 1 elements,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(n + r - 1)!}{n!(r-1)!} .
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example - Sampling with Replacement, without Ordering:'''
An urn contains r balls numbered one through r.
A ball is drawn from the urn and its number is recorded.
The ball is then returned to the urn.
This procedure is repeated a total of n times.
The outcome of this experiment is a table that contains the number of times each ball has come in sight.
We are interested in computing the number of distinct outcomes.
This is equivalent to counting the ways a set with n elements can be partitioned into r subsets.
The number of possible outcomes is therefore given by

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(n + r - 1)!}{n!(r-1)!} .
&lt;/math&gt;

== Computing Probabilities ==

In this section, we present two straightforward applications of combinatorics to computing the probability of winning the lottery.

'''Example - Pick 3 Texas Lottery:'''
The Texas Lottery game ''Pick 3'' is easy to play.
A player must pick three numbers from zero to nine, and choose how to play them: exact order, or any order.
The Pick 3 balls are drawn using three air-driven machines.
These machines use compressed air to mix and select each ball.

The probability of winning while playing the exact order is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{10} \frac{1}{10} \frac{1}{10}
= \frac{1}{1000} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of winning while playing any order depends on the numbers selected.
If three distinct numbers are selected then the probability of winning is 3/500.
If a number is repeated twice, the probability of winning is 3/1000.
While, if the same number is selected three times, the probability of winning becomes 1/1000.

'''Example - Mega Millions Texas Lottery:'''
To play the Mega Millions game, a player must select five numbers from 1 to 56 in the upper white play area of the play board, and one Mega Ball number from 1 to 46 in the lower yellow play area of the play board.
All drawing equipment is stored in a secured on-site storage room.
Only authorized drawings department personnel have keys to this door.
Upon entry of the secured room to begin the drawing process, a lottery drawing specialist examines the security seal to determine if any unauthorized access has occurred.
For each drawing, the Lotto Texas balls are mixed by four acrylic mixing paddles rotating clockwise.
High speed is used for mixing and low speed for ball selection.
As each ball is selected, it rolls down a chute into an official number display area.
We wish to compute the probability of winning the Mega Millions Grand Prize, which require the correct selection of the five white balls plus the gold Mega ball.
The probability of winning the Mega Millions Grand Prize is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{51!5!}{56!} \frac{1}{46}
= \frac{1}{175 711 536} .
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Random Variables: Definitions==

Formally, a ''random variable'' on a probability space &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,P)&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable real function ''X'' defined on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (the set of possible outcomes)

:&lt;math&gt;X: \Omega\ \to \ \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, 

where the property of measurability means that for all real ''x'' the set 

:&lt;math&gt;\{X \le x\} := \{\omega\in \Omega|X(\omega) \le x\} \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. is an event in the probability space.

===Discrete variables===

If X can take a finite or countable number of different values, then we say that X is a ''discrete random variable'' and we define the ''mass function'' of X, p(&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;) = P(X = &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;), which has the following properties:
* p(&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; 0
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} p(x_i) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Any function which satisfies these properties can be a mass function.

;Variables
:We need some way to talk about the objects of interest. In set theory, these objects will be sets; in number theory, they will be integers; in functional analysis, they will be functions. For these objects, we will use lower-case letters: a, b, c, etc. If we need more than 26 of them, we’ll use subscripts.

;Random Variable
:an unknown value that may change everytime it is inspected. Thus, a random variable can be thought of as a function mapping the sample space of a random process to the real numbers. A random variable has either a associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or a probability density function (continuous random variable).

;Random Variable &quot;X&quot;
:formally defined as a measurable function (probability space over the real numbers).

;Discrete variable
:takes on one of a set of specific values, each with some probability greater than zero (0). It is a finite or countable set whose probability is equal to 1.0.

;Continuous variable
:can be realized with any of a range of values (ie a real number, between negative infinity and positive infinity) that have a probability greater than zero (0) of occurring. Pr(X=x)=0 for all X in R. Non-zero probability is said to be finite or countably infinite.

===Continuous variables===

If X can take an uncountable number of values, and X is such that for all (measurable) ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;P(X \in A) = \int_A f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;,

we say that X is a ''continuous variable''. The function f is called the ''(probability) density'' of ''X''. It satisfies:
*&lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge\ 0\ \forall x \in\ \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1&lt;/math&gt;

===Cumulative Distribution Function===

The ''(cumulative) distribution function'' (c.d.f.) of the r.v. X, &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt; is defined for any real number x as:

:&lt;math&gt;F_X (x) = P(X \le  x)=\begin{cases} \sum_{i: x_i \le\ x} p(x_i), &amp; \mbox{if }X\mbox{ is discrete} \\ \, \\ \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(y) dy, &amp; \mbox{if }X\mbox{ is continuous} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The distribution function has a number of properties, including:

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to-\infty} F(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty} F(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
* if x &lt; y, then F(x) &amp;le; F(y) -- that is, F(x) is a non-decreasing function.
* F is right-continuous, meaning that F(x+h) approaches F(x) as h approaches zero from the right.

===Independent variables===
&lt;!-- Due to not understanding the notion of function, r.v. and density, the following is not correct

2 Variables x and y are independent if their joint probability function is the product of their individual probability functions

&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)= f(x)* f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

For example if

&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=exp(-(x+y))x,y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
and if
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=exp(-x) x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(y)=exp(-y) x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

then x and y are independent random variable

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is inflation?'''

Inflation can be defined as the increase in the overall level of prices. Whilst the price of individual goods or services may vary due to changes in [[supply and demand]], [[production costs]] or technological progress, inflation refers to the increase in the price level as a whole or for a selection of goods and services (commonly referred to in economics as a [[basket of goods]]).  The result of inflation is that the nominal amount of goods and services that a unit of currency can purchase (its [[purchasing power]]) declines over time. 

Of course, there is, in theory, nothing which make inflation an inherent feature of our economies. In historical times there have been prolonged periods of [[deflation]] (where the overall level of prices falls) as well as [[hyperinflation]] and [[disinflation]].

'''Examples'''
1) ..... The average price of a specific &quot;basket&quot; of goods and services today is 100. If one year later the average price of a &quot;basket&quot; containing the SAME goods and services will cost you 300, then the currency of your country is worth only 1/3 as much as a year ago as a result of inflation. As a result of inflation all the prices of the SAME goods and services have increased.

..... Inflation is stated as a percentage. Assume, for example, that inflation is steady, every year the same, at 2% per year. Then an item that costs now 100 would cost after 1 year 102, then in future years: 104.04 106.12 108.24 110.41 112.62 114.87 117.17 119.51 121.90 and so on.


2) ..... Labor or labour unions always want more and more money to &quot;make ends meet&quot;, and so do most other people. The price of goods and services must cover all costs, including all involved salaries and wages. If the currency is worth less as a result of inflation, then all costs go up, and therefore all prices go up. But because prices go up, everybody wants a raise in wages/salary. Therefore the costs go up again, the prices go up some more, and so on and so on. THAT is the unfortunate result of the inflation &quot;spiral&quot;.

[[Image:Hand Beater.jpg|right|thumb|Egg beater (hand powered)]]
A '''beater''' is the normal [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] attachment, typically somewhat [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]-like in shape. It can also be a hand-powered tool, usually called an ''egg beater'', as shown at right.

Beaters are used with foods that do not require great force to mix. Example usages:

*making [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]] from [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*[[Cookbook:Beating|beating]] [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] to make a [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]]
*mixing thin [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] batter

Beaters are not suitable for mixing thick [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookie]] dough, [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] dough, or [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] dough. The beaters might stall the motor of the mixer or bend. Beaters are also difficult to clean dough from. You should use [[Cookbook:Dough Hook|dough hooks]] for such tasks.</text>

[[Image:Handheld Electric Beater.jpg|thumb|right|electric mixer with beaters]]
[[Image:Hand Beater.jpg|thumb|right|hand-cranked mixer (&quot;beater&quot;)]]

A '''mixer''' is a kitchen appliance for mixing, beating, kneading, and whipping.

Usually, a mixer is used with [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]-like [[Cookbook:Beater|beater]] attachments. These are usually removable from an electric mixer, but permanently attached to a hand-cranked mixer. For this reason hand mixers are sometimes simply called beaters.

A typical mixer is electric and has two removable beaters that spin in place. The mixer comes with an optional stand that holds the mixer and a purpose-made bowl, allowing the bowl to rotate. Helical (corkscrew-like) [[Cookbook:Dough Hook|dough hook]] attachments are usually provided for working with moderately tough dough. Sometimes these mixers are sold cheaply without the stand and bowl.

A more effective and expensive design uses a stationary bowl and a single beater that moves in an orbital motion in addition to rotating. In this case the mixer can not be operated in a hand-held manner, but it is more likely to have a powerful motor and provide good support for unusual attachments like grinders. Mixers of this type can be very large. Sometimes the bowl is clamped at both sides rather than being held from the bottom.

A hand-cranked mixer can only perform the job of a [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]. Compared to a whisk, the advantage of a hand-cranked mixer is gearing that allows for high speed.</text>

[[Image:Waffle Maker.jpg|thumb|right|Electric waffle maker]]

A '''waffle maker''' (also known as a waffle iron) is a type of kitchen appliance used to make [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffles]]. It usually consists of two hinged metal plates, moulded to create the square indentations found on waffles. The batter is poured between the plates, and heated to make the waffle. Commonly these come equipped with an internal heating element, although waffle irons exist that do not depend on electricity; they generally are held over an open flame.

Rectangular shaped waffle irons often can be converted to a '''griddle''' (or flat iron) by removing the iron plating and flipping it over.  This is ideally used to make pitchy breads (specifically pancakes), but can also double as an ungreased frying pan (grease will generally run into the spill groove; batter should be too thick).  Oddly shaped or patterned irons usually lack this feature, as they will heat unevenly.  Check the manual or manufacturer's website before attempting this conversion.

And no man hath&lt;br&gt;ascended up to heaven, but he that came&lt;br&gt;down from heaven, even the Son of man&lt;br&gt;which is in heaven.

He&lt;br&gt;that believeth on me, as the scripture hath&lt;br&gt;said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of&lt;br&gt;living water. (But this spake he of the&lt;br&gt;Spirit, which they that believe on him&lt;br&gt;should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not&lt;br&gt;yet given; because that Jesus was not yet&lt;br&gt;glorified.) Joh. 7: 37-38

|Surely he hath borne our griefs, and&lt;br&gt;carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem&lt;br&gt;him stricken, smitten of God, and&lt;br&gt;afflicted. Is. 53: 4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Toaster.jpg|thumb|right|A Toaster]]

A '''toaster''' is a kitchen appliance for toasting food such as sliced bread, crumpets, and bagels. Toasted bread is called toast. A typical toaster uses heat radiated from hot electric elements to heat a piece of bread. The toasting process consists of reducing the bread's water content, raising its temperature, and slightly charring and caramelizing its surface. The caramelizing process is a chemical reaction in which the complex starch molecules break apart into simpler sugar molecules upon heating. That is why toast is usually sweeter than normal bread.

More recent additions to toaster technology include the ability to toast frozen bread (as with the toaster pictured), separate operation levers to allow users to toast either two or four slices, and reheating functions which allow toast to be warmed without being burned.

A '''pasta maker''' or '''pasta machine''' is a medium-sized kitchen tool designed to simplify the process of rolling and cutting [[Cookbook:Strong Noodles|strong noodles]], [[Cookbook:Egg noodles|egg noodles]], or other kinds of dough to make fresh [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] such as ravioli, lasagne, fettuccine, and tagliatelle.

The machine is used to roll pasta dough into a progressively thinner sheet with each pass through the machine. When the desired thickness is reached, the sheet can be used as it is to make ravioli. Some machines (like the one shown) have inbuilt cutters where the sheet can be passed through a cutter and separated into strips of the appropriate width.

Unlike an extrusion type pasta maker, the manual type has a crank attached or in most cases, slots for a crank on the side.  The crank turns a series of rollers, some interlocking to cut, and others just to flatten.  An adjuster wheel on one side controls the distance between the flat roller wheels.  There are typically two sets of cutting wheels, each with its own slot for the crank.  One set is very finely spaced for cutting spaghetti, the other is spaced at about ¼&quot; (5 mm) for fettuccine.</text>

== Arabia, Pre-Islam ==
Before the rise of Islam, the Arabian peninsula was dominated by nomadic '''Bedouin''' cultures that dominated the region.  The polytheistic bedouin clans placed heavy emphasis on kin-related groups, with each clan clustered under tribes.  Warfare between tribes was common among the Bedouin, and warfare was given a high honor.  The difficult living conditions in the Arabian peninsula created a heavy emphasis on family cooperation, further strengthening the clan system.

Although the majority of Arabia was nomadic, there were several important cities that came into being as centers of trade and religion, such as Yathrib [Medina], '''Mecca''', Karbala and Damascus.  The most important of these cities was Mecca, which was an important center of trade in the area, as well as the location of the '''Ka'ba''', one of the most revered shrines in polytheistic Arabia.

Culturally, Pre-Islamic Arabia was similar to what would come later, with some notable differences.  Pre-Islam, most Bedouin tribes were polytheistic and animist, with some notable exceptions (three of the ruling tribes of Yathrib were Jewish).  A few tribes worshiped one supreme being, called Allah, but this was not common.  Like later cultures in the region, the Bedouin tribes placed heavy importance on poetry as well as oral tradition.

== Muhammad and the Beginnings of Islam ==
'''Muhammad''' was born to the prominent Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe.  His father died befor he was born and his mother died when he was six. He was raised by his grandfather until he died when Muhammad was eight and later by his uncle.  Muhammad was raised as, and became, a merchant.

While a young man, Muhammad worked as a trader for a wealthy widow, '''Khadijah''', whom he would marry a few years later.  His work as a merchant arguably influenced his philosophy as he encountered different cultures and religions, most notably Christianity and Judaism.

Around 610 AD, Muhammad received the first of his revelations from the angel Gabriel; these revelations were written (in Arabic) into the '''Qu'ran''', where they would form the basis for the religion of '''Islam'''.  The early followers of this new faith were small, including mostly his wife, some clansmen, some servants and slaves.  Muhammad began to preach his new faith to his clan and the people of Mecca.

As Islam spread, the dominant clan in Mecca, the '''Umayyad''', saw the new faith as a threat to their political power and to their religious power held by controlling the polytheistic shrines at Ka'ba.  As the religion spread, Muhammad grew to be further threatened by the Umayyads.  Muhammad was perceived as a danger similar to the conditions in Yathrib, where two religions (Judaism and the Bedouin religion) fought for power.  

Because of the the danger for Muhammad and his followers in Mecca, they left Mecca in favor of Yathrib.  This event is known as the ''hijra''.  Muhammad was jubilantly welcomed in Yathrib, and the city was renamed &quot;Medina&quot;, due to his ability to end the religious quarrels in the city.  Islam spread rapidly in Medina, and became a center of the new faith.  Muhammad's power grew in the city of Medina.

Under Muhammad's leadership, Medina strengthened in power and soon rivaled Mecca.  Muslim raids on Meccan treaders further endangered the Umayyads.  The Quraysh fought with the Muslims in the mid-620s.  In 628, Muhammad signed a peace treaty with the Umayyads.  In 629, Muhammad and 10,000 converts returned to Mecca.  Claiming to have proven the power of Allah, the shrine at Ka'ba was smashed. The Umayyads and others in Mecca converted to Islam in time.

== The Rise and Fall of the Umayyad Empire ==
Muslim armies conquered most of Arabia by 633, further spreading Islam.  Muslim armies soon conquered north Africa, Mesopotamia and Persia, significantly shaping the history of the world through the spread of Islam there.

Following the death of Muhammad in 632, tribal leaders convened on who should succed him.  After much debate between the choices of '''Ali''' (Muhammad's son-in-law) and '''Abu Bakr''' (Muhammad's close friend, an early convert, and political strong), Abu Bakr was chosen to lead and became the first caliph, this decision would later spawn controversy.'''Ali''' would go on to become the fourth caliph later 

During the caliphate of Abu Bakr (632-634 AD), the warlike Bedouin clans united to spread Islam.  The weakness of the rich Byzantine and Persian empires encouraged them to expand.  These new lands were placed under Arab control through this jihad (Western fallacy is that jihad is used to spread Islam.  Jihad is a struggle and comes in many forms).

A '''dough hook''' is a [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] attachment, typically shaped like a helix (corkscrew shape) or hook. Beaters are used with foods which require great force to mix. Example usages:

*[[Cookbook:Knead|kneading]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* kneading [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] dough
*mixing tough cookie batter

Dough hooks are not very good for making [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]] from [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], [[Cookbook:Beat|beating]] [[Cookbook:Egg|Eggs]] to make a [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]], or mixing thin [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] batter. Normal [[Cookbook:Beater|beaters]] are much more efficient for these tasks.

Unlike most beaters, dough hooks are typically easy to clean.</text>

      <comment>/* Parasympathetic */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Autonomic Nervous System==
*maintains homeostasis by controlling organs, glands, and heart
*controls blood flow, pressure, body temp, and stomach secretions

==Introduction==
*Definition: motor neurons that supply nerves to glands, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles
*The somatic nervous system has different effectors, pathways, and neurotransmitters
*motor unit of ANS is two-neuron chain
**preganglionic neuron is in CNS
**preganglionic axon synapses with ganglionic neuron (an autonomic ganglion) outside CNS
***axon is lightly myelinated, thin
**postganglionic axon extends from the ganglionic neuron to the effector organ
***axon is unmyelinated, thinner
*somatic motor division has no ganglia
*norepinephrine is released at effector organs in sympathetic division
*acetylcholine is released at effector organs in parasympathetic division

==ANS Divisions==
*Parasympathetic and Sympathetic
**usually have opposite effects on same organs/glands - called ''dual innervation''
#Parasympathetic Division
#*conserves body energy
#*maintains base levels for homeostasis
#Parasympathetic effects:
#*pupils constrict
#*increased digestion activity
#*lowered blood pressure, heart rate, breathing
#Sympathetic division
#*fight-or-flight
#Sympathetic responses:
#*pupils dilate
#*increased blood pressure, heart rate, breathing
#*bronchioles dilate
#*increased blood glucose levels for increased muscle activity
#*sweating
#*During exercise, blood is taken from the skin and digestive viscera to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles.

==ANS Anatomy==
*divisions are distinguished by
**origin
***parasympathetic - brain and sacrum
***sympathetic - thoracic and lumbar
**length of fibers
***parasympathetic - long preganglionic, short postganglionic
***sympathetic - short preganglionic, long postganglionic
**location of ganglia
***parasympathetic - close to visceral effector organs
***sympathetic - close to spine

===Parasympathetic===
*oculomotor nerves (III) - for constricting pupils
*facial nerves (VII) - activates nasal, lacrimal, and salivary glands
*glossopharyngeal nerves (IX) - salivary glands
*vagus nerves (X) - 90% of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers
**to neck, nerve plexuses
**cardiac plexuses
**pulmonary plexuses
**esophageal plexuses
**aortic plexus
**supplies liver, gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, kidneys, pancreas, proximal large intestine
*sacral outflow
**serves distal large intestine, bladder, ureters, reproductive organs
*parasympathetic fibers never run in spinal nerves

===Sympathetic===
*more complex than parasympathetic - more organs
*sympathetic neurons produce the lateral horns, which are absent in sacral region of spinal cord
*nerves leave cord through the ventral root
**pass through the white ramus
**enter chain ganglion, where it either:
**#synapses in same ganglion
**#moves to another ganglion and synapses there
**#passes through ganglion without synapsing
**If 1 or 2, nerve goes through gray ramus and exits
**If 3, exits through white ramus

===Visceral Reflexes===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nut}} | [[Cookbook:Vegetables]] | [[Cookbook:Legume|Legume]]

The '''peanut''', also known as the '''groundnut fruit''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Legume|legume]] that is often used as if it were a [[Cookbook:Nut|nut]].

Peanuts are used to make [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]], [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]], and [[Cookbook:Peanut Sauce|peanut sauce]].

==Recipes featuring peanuts include==
*[[Cookbook:Gado-gado|Gado-gado]]

==Warnings==
*Moldy peanuts are deadly. They contain [[w:Aflatoxin|aflatoxin]]. In time, even low amounts can lead to cancer.
*Many people are horribly allergic to peanuts. [[Cookbook:Cashew|Cashews]] can often be substituted.</text>

      <comment>/* JPEG vs. PNG */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Microsoft's XPS format ==
Someone added: &quot;Microsoft has introduced a new PDF-like fixed document format named XPS, based on XML. This format has already gained the support of many industry heavyweights and is poised to become a great format for archival purposes.&quot; Appart from not being NPOV the comparison with PDF is not quite correct. I'll look at that after the move. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 21:06, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== HTML vs. RTF ==

I'm surprised to see no mention of HTML.
Is RTF significantly superior to HTML?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:33, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

See this article
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_document_markup_languages

Good point, I think I'll redo that bit. The danger is that people using MSOffice will think that saving it as html is a good thing. In that specific case RTF is better. -- Duncan (not signed in)

== JPEG vs. PNG ==
I'd like to point out that JPEGs saved at level 12 (highest quality) are, in fact, lossless. They are sometimes also smaller (though not always) than an equivalent PNG image, and thus may be preferable for use (especially considering their universal use; not all applications can read PNG.)

''No. JPEGs are always lossy.''
''Have you ever compared images before and after JPEG compression?''
''The [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/part1/section-13.html JPEG FAQ (Last-modified: 28 March 1999)] says''

:&quot;cranking a regular JPEG implementation up to its maximum quality setting *does not* get you lossless storage; even at the highest possible quality setting, baseline JPEG is lossy because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  Roundoff errors alone are nearly always too small to be seen, but they will accumulate if you put the image through multiple cycles of compression (see section 10).&quot;

''While I've heard that the Joint Photographic Experts Group are working on lossless compression of images, my understanding is that far more applications understand PNG than any kind of &quot;lossless JPEG&quot;.''
''If this situation has changed since 1999, I will be very suprised -- please tell me more. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:33, 26 May 2005 (UTC)''

: The JPEG2000 standard allows for lossless compression, but it is a) proprietary (that is, licenses need to be purchased for software implementing the standard) and b) not highly deployed or well supported in software due to a) ... 
: ''The thing about standards is... there's so many of them to choose from.''
: -- [[User:Horst.Burkhardt|Horst.Burkhardt]] ([[User talk:Horst.Burkhardt|talk]]) 08:21, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

== patents ==

While patents may be a problem '''now''', they are certainly no special risk for '''long-term''' data storage. If anything, that eliminates the risk. The patent will expire. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:08, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== Thoughts (Encryption, DRM, Spreadsheets, multiple formats) ==

Perhaps the dangers of DRM and encryption should be mentioned? I'd hate to see someone archive something in, say, an encrypted odf and forget the key... Also, why are databases and spreadsheets listed together? Why isn't it mentioned that it may be wise to store multiple copies? For example, keeping an ODF and an ASCII text file of the same thing, or a vector graphic and then a rasterized copy.

:Please sign you comments in future. Someone is very welcome to write about DRM. Not my field. Password issues are valid and should be included, would anyone like to add a note where appropriate? Yes, people should keep multiple copies, but that's for a backup article to say, maybe we could mention it though. ODF files are ASCII compliant, though I have questions about the uncompression issues in the future - any thoughts out there? --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 09:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

==linking style==
Why did you change [[Cookbook:Gado-gado]]? Maybe you misread my changes. To someone ''not'' editing the page, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s and [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; look identical. ([[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s and [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]) To someone editing the page, it is easier to read and change the wikitext if the &quot;s&quot; is inside the square brakets.
* Untrue.  Putting the plural outside of the square brackets is better style.  It discourages the habits of using piped links and redirects unnecessarily, and it discourages the habit of treating the square brackets as if they were parentheses, which they are ''not''.  (I've seen ''punctuation'' put inside the square brackets before now, because of such thinking.)  The claim that it is easier to change the wikitext if the whole word is within the square brackets is false.  (After all, [[Help:Editing#Links.2C_URLs|link]]ing is a basic feature of the wiki markup that every editor soon learns to be familiar with.)  Indeed, doing so actually makes things ''harder'' to edit, since it encourages practices and thinking that lead to mistakes and broken links, for the reasons given. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 09:30, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
** You're using Wikipedia thinking on Wikibooks, where it truly does not belong. Piped links are mandatory here. If I wish to change the word, the rules of the English language dictate that I might also need to change the ending. I should not need to hit the arrow key or delete and retype the square brackets. Having the word in one place is obviously more readable too; breaking words for no reason is very bad.
*** Wrong on both counts.  The wiki markup is the same everywhere, and the same thinking applies everywhere.  (You are apparently unaware that the page that I linked to above, [[Help:Editing]], is the same everywhere.  It's from Meta.)  And piped links are ''not'' mandatory here.  They are simply ''more common'', which is simply because hiding the existence of sub-pages is more common.  That's not the same as being mandatory.  Moreover, the argument about &quot;rules of the English language&quot; is just silly.  There are no &quot;rules of the English language&quot; that dictate wiki markup.  There ''are'', however, good stylistic and foolproofing reasons to take advantage of the WikiMedia blended ending feature, which I've outlined above. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 23:29, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==the [[Cookbook]] style==
We don't use subpages in the cookbook. This has been generally agreed upon and accepted. Please take care next time you edit pages related to the cookbook. Following the style everyone else uses would be greatly appreciated. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:58, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
*''This has been generally agreed upon and accepted.'' &amp;mdash;  False.  See the big pastel box at the top of [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]].  ''Please take care next time you edit pages related to the cookbook.'' &amp;mdash;  The person that you should be addressing your comments to is the anonymous user who created the cookbook pages without adhering to ''any'' convention, not me.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:26, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
**Yes indeed, see that page. In the pink box: &quot;for all '''future''' Wikibooks&quot;. Then, if you can read down the page a bit, the Cookbook is given as an example of a book using the &quot;:&quot; convention. So, right on that page, it says you should use the &quot;:&quot; for the Cookbook. Then you can simply look around in the Cookbook, see [[User_talk:Gentgeen]] where Gentgeen agrees with me, notice that even the recipe template uses &quot;:&quot; notation... Note that I do have some respect for people who can admit they are wrong. In any case, you are expected to abide by the style of any book you edit, even if you don't like that style. Style changes need to be generally agreed upon '''by the normal cookbook editors''' (Gentgeen, me, Redlentil, etc.), then fully implemented with the horrendous task of converting everything. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:37, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
***''I do have some respect for people who can admit they are wrong.'' &amp;mdash; By that principle, we should only respect you for admitting that you were wrong for addressing your comments to me instead of to the anonymous user who created the cookbook pages without adhering to ''any'' convention.  You still haven't. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 02:33:06, 2005-08-19 (UTC)

== Creating user page ==

''I am my contributions history''

Heh. Lemme guess. Someone complained about the &quot;red link&quot;. But I agree with you. A user should be primarily judged on their contribs, and not what they say on their user page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:51, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki ==
I see you either you or your bot is moving pages from the transwiki pseudo-namespace into the [[Cookbook]] without fixing the links. For example, [[Cookbook:Drawn butter]]. Can you please avoid this, since newbies tend to click on these and fill them in with dictionary definitions. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:28, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
*The 'bot copies the pages exactly as they stand, as it should.  If you want the internal links turned into interwiki links, then either ''fix them yourself'' or have some patience and ''wait'' until I've processed the entire queue and I'm free to go back and join everything up.  (It should be obvious that I'm only partway through a long task.  I haven't even linked the new cookbook recipes into the Cookbook proper, yet.) [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:43:56, 2005-08-18 (UTC)
**Okay. It's fine if you intend to fix all this yourself, but I'd prefer you did these transwikis one at a time, and fix them before moving onto the next. As a general rule, stuff dumped here from WP which is not fixed up to conform will get deleted. Sorry, but I don't have the time to fix-up all the unwanted shite from WP. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:18, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
***There's no &quot;unwanted shite from Wikipedia&quot;.  That's simply false.  I suggest less parochialism and more looking at what is actually the case.  Read the transwiki log and the actual articles that have come through the system.  As for how you would prefer me to work, since you state that you don't &quot;don't have time&quot; to do the actual work yourself, you'll have to accept the way that those of us who ''do'' do the work, choose to do it. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 02:33:06, 2005-08-19 (UTC)
****Even if &quot;the work&quot; you &quot;choose&quot; to &quot;do&quot; is more of a hinderance to our goals than a help? However. Let me try to be more helpful. I don't mind people leaving stuff in the transwiki pseudo-namespace, but when moving content from there to an actual book, it ought to meet the guidelines of the book in question. If you can't be bothered to fix it up, then just leave it in the transwiki pseudo-namespace, so someone else can do it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:29, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
*****''Even if &quot;the work&quot; you &quot;choose&quot; to &quot;do&quot; is more of a hinderance to our goals than a help?'' &amp;mdash; It's not a hindrance in any way.  Your question is based upon a false premise and is unanswerable.  It's also sneering in tone.  The remainder of your comments, talking about what &quot;I prefer&quot; and &quot;I don't mind&quot;, come across as exceedingly egotistical, moreover.  You are not the king of Wikibooks.  That's [[User:Jimbo Wales]].&lt;p&gt;''If you can't be bothered to fix it up'' &amp;mdash;  Have a care!  If there's anyone at whom the charge of &quot;cannot be bothered&quot; can be levelled at here, it is ''you'', not anyone else.  See your above response to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sofixit}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;p&gt;''just leave it in the transwiki pseudo-namespace, so someone else can do it'' &amp;mdash;  That's entirely the wrong idea, and is a recipe for stagnation.  If an editor knows what book or bookshelf the transwikied article belongs in, then it is perfectly all right to rename the article there and link it into the book/bookshelf, leaving further attention to the article to other editors.  Wikibooks is founded upon the notion of ''collaborative editing'', remember.  It is ''not'' required that one editor do either everything or nothing.  Rather, it is perfectly acceptable for one editor to do just ''one'' of the steps towards improving a book.  Every little helps.  [[User:Kellen]] is demonstrating collaboration in action.  This is how wikis are supposed to work.  Please watch and learn.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:03:55, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
******Okay. Let's end this exchange of personal insults, as it's not achieving anything useful. In keeping with site policy, you ought to update your bot's code to change links of the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:article|article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:49, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
*******Again you demand that ''I'' do edits that ''you'' (singular) want made.  I reiterate the &amp;#123;&amp;#123;sofixit&amp;#125;&amp;#125; above: ''If you want something edited, edit it yourself.''  This is a wiki.  I also reiterate my suggestion that you watch and learn from [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 23:51, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
*****I think in the case of the Cookbook, the additional tagging of things with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; takes care of this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
Hi, for the transwikis, would you mind adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the top so that we can see they need help? Thanks! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:25, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
*Bear in mind that if you want to tag all of the pages with whatever tags you like yourself, you need only follow [[Special:Contributions/Uncle G's 'bot]] or (the probably more convenient) [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log/Articles moved to here]]. (I haven't logged the page moves in the latter, yet.  But it is reasonably obvious even without that which are the recipe articles.) [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 02:33:06, 2005-08-19 (UTC)
**I'm not trying to be snarky, but if you have a bot going through stuff, a lot of which is Cookbook-related, it would be more useful for your bot to automatically tag them than for someone like me to go through and manually tag them. This will lessen the amount of work you do later (assuming you'd update links, etc, etc by hand) since someone unfamiliar with the fact that you are doing transwikis might pay more attention to them if they're properly demarcated. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:20, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
***TRANSWIKI cannot do this.  It's a generic transwikification utility that has no special knowledge of Wikibooks, let alone of the Cookbook.  I've had to write a whole new 'bot. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:46:10, 2005-08-19 (UTC)
****Thank you for doing so. I shall be doing some cleanup on the transwikis. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:03, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
*****Excellent.  There are a few more Cookbook articles yet to be transferred from Wikipedia. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:03:55, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
*****There are no more Cookbook articles in the queue.  (It's just the trickier stuff. &amp;#9786;)  Please cast an eye over [[w:Category:Soups]] and note any that you don't have. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 03:26:37, 2005-08-23 (UTC)

== Transwiki of images ==
What's the proper form for the tranwiki-ing of images? I have [[w:Image:Arambas.jpg]], which should probably go to commons (it's linked from a transwikied recipe; unlinked anywhere else on WP). I didn't see any documentation on this -- do I just save it and reupload it? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:08, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
*I don't know.  I've never done it.  If an image were a ''public domain'' image, then you could just download and upload it.  I don't know the procedure for GFDL images.  I believe that, for starters, you're supposed to upload all of the older revisions of the image in addition to the current one.  The problem with ''that'' particular image is that it isn't tagged with its copyright status, so we don't even know whether it is allowable on Commons at all.  I've listed it at [[w:Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:11:01, 2005-08-23 (UTC)

== Nomination for Adminship ==
I hope you don't mind, but I've [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Nominations for adminship|nominated you for adminship]] here on Wikibooks.  You've been a solid editor and contributor here, and seem to have a good grasp of what is going on in terms of general policies.  I'm not expecting you to necessarily be active in admin duties, but you certainly have proven yourself ''here'' on Wikibooks as an avid contributor and somebody IMHO worthy to have the extra privileges that can be given to admins.  If you would like this, please reply and accept the nomination. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:56, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

== MoC ==

Hi, I'm curious what you think of [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/The_Manual_of_Crime#Jimbo.27s_recommendation_on_Wikibooks_policy|Jimbo's comment]] with respect to the MoC (and indeed to wikibooks in general). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:29, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Sandbox and bot ==
Please change the way your bot resets [[WB:SB|Sandbox]]. Sandbox does not need to be included in the page any more, because it's included in {{tl|Welcome to the SandBox!}}. Now there are two shortcuts in Sandbox. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 00:12, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
*Done.  It will take effect from the next pass. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 00:14, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki ==
Transwikied articles aren't easy to find now. I suggest your bot adds a template categorising new articles in category like ''Transwikied articles''. We should also provide link to this category and instructions what to do with these pages, f.e. from Projects in Community portal. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:57, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
*They're easy to find, and always have been.  No categories are required.  All transwikifications performed by me are recorded in the [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 01:07, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
But this page is not linked well, it's hard to reach it. BTW, why your bot does not have bot flag? I don't like bots appearing at recent changes. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
*It's the standard place to find the transwiki log on ''all'' projects.  And [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]] does not do the sort of high volume work that requires a flag.  That's the remit of [[User:Uncle G's major work 'bot]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:14, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== Thanks for deletion and moving ==
Hello. You are very kind to have moved many pages (Japanese/Vocabulary related), not just deleted the pages on VfD. Thanks a lot! - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 08:42, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
*I leave it to you to remove all of the now superfluous navigation links from the pages. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:00, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

== computer systems ==
I am making a list of all laptop computers currently sold (new) for under $500.
I think such a list should go on a wiki. (That way, other people can help me keep the list up-to-date by removing things that are no longer being manufactured, and adding new things as they come on the market).

(I've already stuck the list online at
http://communitywiki.org/odd/ComputerComponent/NoteBook
.
However, that location is very experimental / non-permanent, and I'm looking for a better location.
)

Do you think such a list would be appropriate for Wikibooks? Should I stick that list on or near modules [[Computers for Beginners/Buying A Computer]] or [[How To Build A Computer]], or is there somewhere else more appropriate?

I ask you because I see from [[Special:Undelete/Computer_Magazine/Systems/Reviews]] that
: Uncle G deleted &quot;Computer Magazine/Systems/Reviews&quot; (Reviews are fundamentally incompatible with the [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]].)
I hope this simple &quot;list of all laptop computers currently sold (new) for under $500&quot; can be made NPOV without too many conflicts. What do you think?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:55, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
*Speaking for myself only and not for other editors (so double check at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]): Unlike the case for reviews, the question here is one of compatibility with the project aims, not neutrality.  A simple catalogue of computer prices, even a collaboratively written one, doesn't seem to me to fall within the &quot;instructional and educational texts&quot; remit of Wikibooks ''at all''.  It's neither instructional nor educational.  One wouldn't expect to find that sort of thing within a school textbook on computers or within a &quot;teach yourself computers&quot; book.  I don't see it as falling squarely within the &quot;sum of human knowledge&quot; remit of the Wikimedia Foundation projects as a whole, even.  The Wikimedia project whose remit comes closest would be Wikipedia, but it's not close enough I think.  A collaboratively maintained catalogue of computers by price would almost certainly be excluded from Wikipedia, on the grounds of it being original research and Wikipedia not being a resource for conducting business.  I know that customer-maintained &quot;price watch&quot; sites exist elsewhere on the World Wide Web.  Have a look around to see whether there is one that covers laptop PCs.  If not, maybe it's time for you to set up your second wiki. &amp;#9786; [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 17:31, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

== CheckUser ==
You probably have missed CheckUser discussion in Staff Lounge. I would like to become a candidate for CheckUser rights, but I need at least one more person who also wants to be CheckUser.

*I actually saw the discussion.  If the community is happy that we actually ''need'' users with this privilege (as opposed to relying upon Stewards) in the first place, I'll accept that nomination.  Do you think that we need the opinions of more editors on that? [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
**I think 2-3 people with CheckUser rights would be just ok, but I don't see third candidate for this function now, noone has expressed will to become one. Maybe you have any suggestions? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
***I'll think it over.  Are 2 insufficient? [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== Hi...  ==
Are you aware that we have [[Special:Import]] enabled from Wikipedia? Please turn off the bot :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
*[[Special:Import]] is only available to administrators.  [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]] does not have administrator privileges, and so cannot use it. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
**Aren't you an admin here? In general, we wanted the import tool because we didn't want to use that kind of transwiki when avoidable. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
***That's wrong.  You are confused about what Wikibooks doesn't want.  What Wikibooks doesn't want is people just copying and pasting articles from other projects here.  That's very different to the proper transwikifications that [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]] does.  The 'bot does all of the several things that are necessary for GFDL compliance.  Part of the reason that we don't want people just copying and pasting articles here is that plain copies and pastes ''aren't'' GFDL-compliant, and unless someone like me comes and fixes them to be GFDL compliant (which I've actually done several times in the past few years &amp;mdash; using the 'bot) we have to delete them for copyright reasons.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:35, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
****Well, that's part of it, but the advantage of imported pages is that the contrib list is all in one place (rather than partially on the history page and partly on the talk page). There are still some cases where we could use the bot though, since Import won't work on pages with much over 1k revisions (surprisingly, there are a lot of those). You don't need a bot for importing... it's very fast and easy, automatically added to the import log, etc. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

== Deletes? ==
Hi - thanks for the work - appreciated.  I see you marked a couple of autobio type pages for deletion.  I ''think'' they are supposed to be subpages of [[Instructional Technology]] (a class project type one I think with a few other misnamed pages).  Would you be happy with them being moved to there?

So, I ask around where to put a new book about FIT2D. People tell me that that is a 'good question' and suggest the Physics bookshelf. The latter proves to be a protected page, but there is a [[Modern Physics]] book that has a page titled [[Modern Physics:X-Ray Diffraction Techniques|X-ray ''diffraction'']] but only contained references to [[XANES]] which is X-ray ''spectroscopy'' not diffraction. So I clean it up a bit and start my FIT2D page there and now it gets tagged as not being linked ot anything, but [[XANES]] does not. Is this part of a general policy to discourage any new additions?

*Please read our [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], and [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]].  Our policy is to encourage textbooks, and we attempt to ensure that orphaned single pages aren't left lying around forgotten.  If your [[FIT2D]] page is intended to be part of the existing [[Modern Physics]] book, then it should be a sub-page, which you can arrange by simply hitting the &quot;move&quot; button.  If it is intended to be a standalone book in its own right, then it should be listed on a bookshelf.  [[Wikibooks:Physics bookshelf]] is not protected, only semi-protected.

==Catullus==

Hello, I've been making steady progress on [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus]], and I've got quite a few poems comprehensively annotated. I was wondering, where I could find a template that warns the user of obscene content? Similar to the template right at the top of the contents page. As you may know, Catullus was infamous for his downright disgusting remarks to his enemies. Thanks in advance. [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 17:13, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

Actually, looking at the code, I think I can do just as well by editing yours? Would something like this be appropriate? [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Poetry_of_Gaius_Valerius_Catullus/113 Catullus 113] [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 17:19, 12 May 2007 (UTC)
*We generally, on any Wikimedia Foundation project, don't do individual content disclaimers for individual pages.  In part this is because there is no neutral standard for deciding what pages such disclaimers should not apply to, and in part because they are wholly redundant.  At the bottom of ''every page here'' you will find a link to the project's disclaimers, amongst which is our [[Wikibooks:Content disclaimer]], which applies globally to all content. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 08:54, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

==[[Special Relativity]]==

Thanks for tackling the issue of deleting that page.  The page in question is no longer linked from the main TOC to the advanced section of the book and it is good that you have raised the issue of whether it should exist at all. SR is in a conceptual vice with the ill informed skeptics on the one hand trying to undermine it using Euclidean ideas and working theoretical physicists on the other hand saying (correctly) that the geometrical interpretation of SR is inconsistent with GR! It is difficult to know what to do in this situation and I have just reflexly taken the approach of adding another section where an objection would undermine the text (probably incorrectly in the case that you raised).

== Topology Wikibook ==

Dear Uncle G,

I have read your notice but I just want you to have a look at the topology wikibook. I have somewhat improved it and hope to do more work. I am new to Wikibooks (but I am a Wikipedian user), so could you please give me your opinion on this? I have written mainly on local connectedness, the comb space and linear continua.

== Inactivity ==

So you're aware, you're up for removal of your adminship due to inactivity. The request will be placed at Meta in one month's time. Thanks for your service; you're welcome to request adminship again if you return to Wikibooks. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:48, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

== Copyright violations ==
Did you notice that the UN has released this content through [[m:OTRS|OTRS]]? I noted that on [[Talk:Asia and Pacific UNISDR Informs Issue 1]] and the other talk pages. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:24, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
*Has it ''actually'' done so?  Did the OTRS volunteer, whoever that was, check that the person from the U.N. contacting xem was in fact authorized to re-licence the copyright?   Did xe check that the U.N. even had the rights to re-licence those of its books that have long lists of authors (such as ''Living with Risk'' whose list of contributors extends to 4 pages)?  Did xe check that the U.N. was actually licencing this as [[w:free content|free content]]?  It might have been merely confirming what it says in the copyright licence of (for example) ''Indicators of Progress'', which is that &quot;Any part of this text may be reproduced without permission provided that it is reproduced accurately and not in a misleading context and the source of the material is clearly acknowledged by means of the above title, publisher and date.&quot;, which is non-free because it prevents the creation of modified versions that differ from the original.  Was due diligence actually employed? [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] ([[User talk:Uncle G|talk]]) 11:49, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
**I was the person who handled that, and the answer is &quot;yes&quot; on all counts. If you had doubts, the correct course of action would have been to ask first. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:28, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
***I ''just did'' ask.  See above?  Those questions are me asking.  So what copyright licence is the U.N. re-releasing ''Indicators of Progress'' under? [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] ([[User talk:Uncle G|talk]]) 13:12, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
****No you didn't, you nominated them for speedy deletion. I'm guessing you would have deleted immediately yourself them if you had the tools. The only reasons these questions got asked is because you couldn't delete them yourself, and I happened to notice that you had tagged them.&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't have to point out that as an OTRS agent it's basically my job to handle permissions issues like this adequately - I do have some idea what I'm doing, otherwise I wouldn't have access. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:55, 4 December 2008 (UTC)
*****Your assumptions reflect how ''you'' would handle this, not how I would.  Stop painting me with your own colours.  You clearly don't handle things well.  That doesn't mean that I would do as you do.&lt;p&gt;How I would handle it is, self-evidently, how I ''did'' handle it, by nominating the articles for deletion as copyright violations.  I notice that you once again failed to answer the question, which I have clearly asked twice, and which I clearly ''did'' ask.  (Again, it's right there in front of you, above.)  This avoidance on your part leads me to doubt your claims that you handled this properly.  You are an OTRS ''volunteer'', not an OTRS ''agent''.  You don't automatically assume a mantle of infallibility by volunteering for something.  Are you going to answer the questions?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hmm, I see that beater has moved to mixer. I'm not familiar with a distinction between beaters and mixers. To me, it seems that different cultures have different norms for their terminology. For me, it's beater for the hand powered, hand-held, and the bench top versions. But, I suppose that the majority opinion rules. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 03:16, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

[[Image:Bain-marie.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Using two pots as a double boiler]]

A '''double boiler''' is a double-walled cooking pot with water in between the walls. This construction limits the maximum temperature to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] point of water, which is generally about [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|200 °F to 212 °F]] (93°C to 100 °C). Two suitably sized pots can function as a double boiler, provided that the inner pot can be kept from touching the outer pot (except perhaps at the top edge) and can be kept stable enough.

If the inner pot seals fairly well against the outer pot, it is not necessary for the inner pot to touch the water.

Double boilers are most commonly used to melt [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]. They can be used to cook [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], preventing the outside from crusting before the inside is fully cooked. Double boilers are also used in the making of Hollandaise sauce and custard-style ice creams to cook egg yolks.

A similar device is the [[Cookbook:Bain-Marie|bain-marie]], which is for use in an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section explains the various camera types and accessories available on the market. It does not attempt to categorize '''all''' available accessories - that's impossible - but attempts to describe the generic types of cameras and accessories available.

==Buying a camera==

===Types of digital cameras===

Broadly speaking Digital cameras can be segregated into two major types: '''Consumer''' and '''Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR)'''. A third type, the '''Prosumer''' camera, usually offers all the features of the consumer camera with some of the features of the DSLR. 

*'''Digital Consumer Cameras'''
:These are made as an all-in-one device. They typically have a fixed lens, and are often loaded with a lot of gimmicks to make them attractive to the average consumer. '''Consumer''' cameras can be roughly divided in two subcategories: 

:* [[wikipedia:Point-and-shoot_camera|Compact Cameras]]
[[File:Panasonic-lumix-tz5.jpg|thumb|right|A Panasonic Lumix TZ5 compact camera]]
::These are generally designed with form in mind over functionality, and are designed to have a high form-factor for the stylish crowd. They tend to have very basic user control or have predefined modes, and often don't allow for much manual adjustments. Typically, these cameras have more pixels and lower image quality.

::These cameras are a good choice if you always want to have your camera with you; they tend to have good form-factor and are lightweight, and most of them can fit into your pocket. Point-and-Shoot cameras can be used without any special knowledge, so they are attractive for those who just want to document events in their lives and do not want go deep into technical aspects of photography.

:* High-end Consumer Cameras
[[File:S6000fujifilmfinepix.jpeg|thumb|right|Fujifilm Finepix S6000 bridge camera.]]
:: These have additional manual control features to allow more creativity and flexibility. For the photography enthusiast, these tend to be the bridge between Point-and-Shoot, and the almost inevitable progression to Digital SLR. 

:: In fact, some of these cameras try to look like Digital SLR cameras but do not have interchangeable lenses and ''Through The Lens'' viewfinder. As they are built with components similar to those found in the Point-and-Shoot cameras, they also suffer from the technical limitations of the Point-and-Shoot cameras. However, better quality control and the use of better optics means these camera can deliver images that are quite good.

: If you have a limited budget and still want to get some of the effects like DOF (Depth Of Field) in your shots then you must select the camera which provides the option of Aperture and Shutter Priority shooting Modes. You can select the model based after trying your hand to click using these settings at the shop. There are many Digital Consumer Camera which have these facilities. Th

[[File:Nikon D700 mit 105-1.8 01 08.jpg|thumb|The Nikon D700 professional camera.]]
*'''Digital Single Lens Reflex Cameras (Digital SLR) '''
:These have ''Through The Lens'' viewfinder, and typically have an interchangeable lens (there are a few digital SLRs which have fixed lenses. In general, however, SLR cameras, both traditional and digital, will have interchangeable lenses). The image sensors on digital SLRs are much larger and of a different construction than on consumer cameras and contributes to higher image quality. 

:Digital SLR focuses on giving high manual control to the user, and when combined with possibility to change lenses, gives a high degree of flexibility to the user. Entry-level Digital SLRs usually have several different automatic modes (similar to Consumer cameras) to make them less intimidating for beginners.

:The high degree of quality control and the array of high-quality optic lenses has a correspondingly huge drawback: cost. A Digital SLR tends to cost a good deal, and a professional level Digital SLR can be 10 to 20 times the cost of a Consumer camera.. ''before'' adding the cost of the lens.

[[File:Nikon D80DSLR.jpg|thumb|Nikon D80, the successor to the D70]]
*'''Digital Prosumer Cameras'''
:'Prosumer' is a term coined by the media and picked up by the industry to describe cameras that are professional in quality but yet sold at consumer prices. It can also be used to describe users of said cameras.

:As such, Prosumer cameras can be either High-end Consumer cameras, or Digital SLR. The key distinguishing factor is high quality at a low price band, and not so much the type of camera.

:As a practical example, [[wikipedia:Nikon|Nikon]]'s ''D70'', a Digital SLR, is generally talked of as a prosumer camera model, and/ or as an entry-level Digital SLR. At the same time, [[wikipedia:Nikon|Nikon]]'s recent addition to their ''Coolpix'' series are largely SLR-like cameras which are also considered prosumer due to their quality.

:In recent years, as the technology in digital photography progressed and matured, [[wikipedia:Nikon|Nikon]] in particular has been pushing more models into the prosumer market. In a similar vein, [[wikipedia:Canon|Canon]] has also been pushing their digital camera models in this direction in direct competition. Other manufacturers like [[wikipedia:Sony|Sony]] and [[wikipedia:Fujifilm|Fujifilm]] are pushing more towards the Point-and-Shoot market, with more emphasis on form-factor and ease-of-use rather than on pushing the capability of their cameras.

:As such, while more prosumer cameras are on the market, these are largely from very well established manufacturers that has extensive experience in camera manufacturing. At the same time, a slew of Point-and-Shoot cameras are coming on the market, some from companies which have very little experience in this industry.

===Memory Cards===
Nearly all digital cameras have an SD-Slot and many newer cameras can use the SDHC-Cards up to 32GB. So the memory card type should not be the deciding factor when purchasing a camera. 
However, if you have other digital devices that use memory cards like an Smartphone, then this may factor into your decision, because not only will this allow you to save some the cost of duplicate sets of cards, but it may allow you directly view the photographs on your Smartphone.

That being said, here is a list of the most popular memory card formats:


'''[[:wikipedia:SD_Card|Secure Digital]]''' [[File:SDHC_memory_card_8GB.png|thumb|8GB SDHC card]] (SDHC) are widely available in a wide range of sizes (up to 32GB) and are cheaper than CompactFlash (CF). 
Because of their smaller size, they are available in many cameras from entry-level up to DSLR-Cameras. 
There is also newer SDXC standard that allows for up to 2TB capacity, many newer devices since 2010 do support these cards.

There is also older SD standard that allows for up to 2GB capacity, which is supported by many older devices.
SDHC and SDHC devices are backward compatible and SD(HC/XC) cards are forward compatible.

'''[[:wikipedia:CompactFlash|CompactFlash]]''' [[File:CompactFlash_Sandisk_4GB_ExtremeIII.jpg|thumb|4GB CompactFlash card]] (CF) cards are widely available in a wide range of sizes (up to 32GB) and are cheaper per megabyte than other standard media. Most prosumer cameras now use CF. CF cards come in two varieties:
*CF Type I - 3.3 mm thick. Cameras designed for CF Type I can't use CF Type II.
*CF Type II - 5 mm  thick. Cameras which use CF Type II also can use CF Type I.  Some manufacturers are selling [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_Microdrive Microdrives] (mini hard drives) packaged in the CF II format.  If your camera supports the CF Type II format it may also support the Microdrive.

'''[[:wikipedia:Multi_Media_Card|Multi Media Card]]''' (MMC) are similar to SD card from outside, but not compatible with SD cards. 

'''[[:wikipedia:XD-Picture_Card|xD-picture Card]]''' (xD) are developed by Fuji and Olympus. They are very compact in size, but usually about two times more expensive than CF or SD cards.

'''[[:wikipedia:Memory_Stick|Memory Stick]]''' (MS) are used by most Sony cameras, and only by Sony Cameras. Most of MS cards are produced by Sony (the only other manufacturers are SanDisk and Lexar) this factor influence rather high prices of MS cards
Memory Stick Duo (MS Duo) variant which is smaller in size, and can be used with regular MS card cameras via adapter.

When buying a digital camera the safe bet is to choose camera which can use CompactFlash, SDXC or SDHC cards. Some cameras can use two different types of cards (e.g. Olypus E-5 and Canon EOS 1D Mark IV can use CompactFlash and Secure Digital cards).

===Battery Life===

Digital compact cameras with no optical viewfinder need much more power than other cameras, because the LCD display is the largest power consumer.

Nearly all digital cameras come with '''[[:wikipedia:Rechargeable_battery|rechargeable]]''' '''[[:wikipedia:Lithium-ion_battery|Li-ion batteries]]'''. Some DSLR cameras like the Pentax K-x use standard Mignon batteries and the most DSLR cameras can be attached to a '''[[:wikipedia:Battery_grip|battery grip]]''', which can hold multiple batteries.


'''Non-rechargeable batteries''' refer to the common batteries cells, commonly available in a variety of sizes. Non-rechargeable batteries are not recommended, because most batteries (or cells) are designed to discharge gradually over time; digital cameras draw power in bursts, which quickly exhausts ordinary batteries. There are batteries designed specifically for digital camera usage, but these tend to be expensive.

Rechargeable batteries have one additional advantage, and that's universal compatibility. You can go to pretty much any country and recharge them with a universal charger supporting 110-230V.

== Other Accessories ==
===Card Readers===
Most cameras come with a [[wikipedia:USB|USB]] connection which you use to transfer digital images from the camera to your computer.  If you are lucky, both your computer and your camera use the USB 2 specification.  Some older cameras use the slower USB 1 specification, or slower yet, your computer's COM port to transfer images.  A device that can speed things up is a USB card reader, which can be purchased at an electronics store, usually for less than the price of one memory card alone.  Most card readers support more than one card type; just make sure it supports the card type you use.  When you wish to transfer the images from the card to the computer, connect the card reader to your computer, pop the card into the card reader, and copy the images from the card to the computer by using file drag and drop.

Many laptop and netbook computers made by Dell, Acer, Asus, and other manufacturers now have built-in card readers. Some support only SD cards, while others support a wider variety. These small card readers seldom support CompactFlash, due to that card's large size and the fact that CF cards can be read using an inexpensive PC card adapter.

===Lens Filters===
[[File:LensFilter-001.jpg|thumb|Three commons styles of lenses filters]]
Among the first accessories a serious photographer considers is lens [[wikipedia:Filter_%28photography%29|filter]]s.  There are many filters available for DSLR lenses, less so for fixed lens cameras.  Lens filters have a threaded mount that screws onto the front of a lens.  They work by modifying the light before it passes through the lens for a wide range of interesting and useful effects.  

When you buy a lens filter you need to buy the correct size for your lens size.  Look for the a number on the front of your lens, some common lens sizes are 52mm and 55mm.  Many camera shops carry the more common sizes.  If yours does not, you may want to contact the manufacturer of your lens if you have a DSLR, or of your camera if you have a fixed lens camera.

A word of caution applies to using colored lens filters with digital photography.  Colored (e.g. orange, red and blue) filters work by limiting the light of a given color passing through the lens; using a blue filter compensates for a yellowish cast; using an orange filter compensates for a bluish cast.  These are used mainly with film photography for color balance, but since almost all digital cameras have an automatic white balance, the effect of a colored filter will not be the same as with film.  In addition some new prosumer cameras have built in filter effects so using an additional colored filter would never be necessary.

Some common and interesting lens filters are:

'''[[wikipedia:Infrared_filter|Infrared Filter]]''' or IR Filter. This filter reduces visible light and allows IR light to pass through the lens; the filter itself appears black or reddish-black.  Infrared images can appear ghostly or other-worldly simply because Infrared radiates and reflects off objects differently than does visible light.

'''''[[wikipedia:Diffusion_filter|Diffusion Filter]]'''. ''A diffusion filter is a translucent photographic filter used for a special effect. When used in front of the camera lens, a diffusion filter softens subjects and generates a dreamy haze. This can also be improvised by smearing petroleum jelly on a UV filter or shooting through a nylon stocking. Diffusion filters may be uniform or may have a clear center area to create a vignette of diffused area around the clear center subject.

Diffusion filters are also used in stage lighting (and likewise in photography setups), where they may also be called diffusion gel, or just diffusion. This is a reference to color gel, which is another type of lighting gel. Diffusion gels soften the light in order to reduce or diffuse shadows or glare.

Silk sheets can also be used in this manner, and in fact were until the invention of translucent plastics. &quot;Opal&quot; is a common translucent or opalescent diffusion.''''

'''[[wikipedia:Polarizer|Polarizing Filter]]'''.  This filter is made of polarizing glass that rotates freely in a circular ring.  A polarizing filter cuts down on reflected light from some angles while allowing light from other angles to pass through the filter.  The effect of a polarizing filter is to darken either the sky or reflections off leaves or water depending on the position of the filter.  The effect can be quite pronounced and appealing.  For more information on how polarizing filters work, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization Polarization]

'''[[wikipedia:UV filter|UV Filter]]'''.  This filter cuts down on UV rays that can make your photograph appear hazy or excessively bluish on bright days.  UV filters come in a range of strengths.
''TIP:'' To protect the front element of that expensive lens you've purchased, get a mild-strength UV filter and screw it onto the lens.  The cost of the filter is very small in comparison to the cost of the lens and having the filter always in place can protect the front lens element with the added benefit of reducing haze whenever you use the lens.  Note: There is considerable controversy on the actual protection a filter supplies to a lens in the event that it dropped. Shards of glass can be very damaging to the surface of the lens.  Many will argue that a lens hood will provide significantly more protection to the front element of a lens AND help reduce the effects of flare and loss of contrast from strong side lights (to which filters are prone).

===Tripods===
[[File:Mini tripod.jpg|thumb|Mini-tripod]]
Tripods are three legged devices used to support a camera to provide stability and greatly improve the quality of photographs.  A single-legged tool that serves the same function is referred to as a monopod.  Because a tripod can remove almost all camera motion, the quality of a tripod is almost as important as the quality of the lens.  The cost of a tripod can vary by an amazing amount.  Flimsy tripods are less stable, durable, flexible, and may even be heavier than a high-quality tripod.

Tripod substitutes:
*monopod
*beanbag

This section deals with the nuts and bolts of actually taking pictures. This is the part where most of us like to spend time on.

====Camera Basics====

A camera is made of two basic parts - the lens, and the camera body. The lens and camera body work together to form all the functions found on this page. 

===Choosing your Level of Control===

Taking a digital photo can be as easy as turning on the camera, pointing it, and pressing the shutter button. The camera will make all the necessary decisions for you. This of course, assumes that you have your camera controls set to auto or program mode. A point and press camera will not make correct adjustments when scenes are heavily back-lit or in mixed light situations for example.  

Advanced cameras allow you to take more control of this process, to allow you to hopefully take better photos. But care must be taken, otherwise you may actually take worse photos.

You will need to decide what level of commitment you want to make to taking terrific photos. There is no guilt here, just do what is best for you.

===Controlling Exposure===
[[Image:Shutter speed in Greenwich.jpg|800px|thumb|center|A demonstration of the effect of exposure in night photography. Longer shutter speeds mean increased exposure.]]
Digital cameras capture a limited range of brightness. File formats like jpeg and tiff, and computer monitors and printers have limits also.

When a digital image is significantly underexposed, certain parts of the image will be simple black, other parts will not express colors accurately, and digital noise will be visible.

Overexposure can cause areas to become simple white, without detail. This is known as &quot;blowing out the highlights.&quot;

In automatic mode, most digital cameras try to adjust exposure to make every picture average brightness. This may not be what you want if you are taking a picture of a bride, or a flamingo, or fireworks. You can improve your pictures by controlling exposure.

====Exposure Value of an Image====

There are four factors which affect the brightness of your image:

* [[wikipedia:Exposure_value|Exposure value]] (EV). Brightness of the scene itself.
* [[wikipedia:Aperture|Aperture]]. The size of the entrance pupil of the lens. The larger the aperture, the more light; the smaller the aperture, the less light.
* [[wikipedia:Shutter_speed|Shutter speed]]. The length of time over which an exposure is made. The longer the exposure, the more light that falls on the imaging medium; the shorter the time, the less light.
* [[wikipedia:Film_speed#Digital_camera_ISO_speed_and_exposure_index|ISO speed]]. Increasing the ISO setting on a digital camera increases the sensitivity of the sensor to light.

====Setting Exposure====

''[[wikipedia:Exposure_%28photography%29|Exposure]]'' - controls the amount of light which reaches the image sensor. Exposure is measured in ''[[wikipedia:Exposure_value|ev]]''. The Aperture and Shutter work together to allow the correct amount of light into the camera. If, for reasons to be discussed later, you wish to make the shutter speed faster (letting in less light); you must compensate by having the aperture open wider (letting in more light). This relationship is known as reciprocity (as it is a reciprocal relationship). As stated in the introduction, you can feel free to play with your camera and get a feel for how this principle can be used without worrying about wasting valuable film. 

*''[[wikipedia:Aperture|Aperture]]'' - defines the size of the opening in the lens. Aperture is measured in ''[[wikipedia:F-number|f-numbers]]'' and often referred to as &quot;f-stops.&quot; Discussion of f-stops is counterintuitive in that the larger the f-stop - the smaller the opening of the lens. The correct unit usage of f-stops appear like: f/2, f/4, f/5.8, etc... However, most cameras find it more economical to truncate the display to show: 2, 4, 5.8, etc... Forgetting that the larger the f-stop - the smaller the hole is a common pitfall of early camera students. 

*''[[wikipedia:Shutter_speed|Shutter speed]]'' - defines the exposure time i.e. the time for which the shutter is held open during the taking of a photograph to allow light to reach the sensor.  Shutter speed is measured in seconds or fractions of a second (e.g. 1s, 1/30s, 1/60s, etc.). 

====Sensitivity of the sensor - setting ISO speed====
[[File:ISO comparison.jpg|thumb|250px|ISO 100 on top compared to ISO 1600 on the bottom.  Taken with a Canon EOS 400D.  Different cameras will have different, but similar results.]]
In film photography, ISO measures the sensitivity of the film used. The more sensitive the film, the less light required to make an appropriate exposure. Consequently, the more sensitive the film, there is a noticeable increase in grain. In digital photography, the metaphor is maintained. The more sensitive you tell your sensor to be, the less light you need to create an exposure; but, it will also be more sensitive to noise. The difference is slight and only a matter of terminology (grain versus noise) but the idea as a whole is transferable. 

There is always a correlation between ISO and noise; however, the amount of noise present at a particular ISO setting is dependent on the specifications of the image sensor - and thus, every camera is different. ''Generally speaking'', professional level cameras have less noise for each of the ISO settings compared to the same settings on consumer level cameras. 

Prosumer SLR cameras tends to perform very well up to ISO800, and even at ISO1600, the noise is noticeable but tolerable. As can be expected, ISO1600 offers a tremendous advantage to photographers in low light/ night environment.

====What is light metering ?====

It should be stated that &quot;metering&quot; is photographer talk for &quot;measuring.&quot; Metering, in photography, can either refer to measuring the light or measuring the actual distance from the camera to the subject. 

There are normally three types of light-metering: evaluative, center weighted average and spot. Your camera uses these to decide on what exposure it should aim for.

Evaluative means your camera will try and choose an exposure which will work well for the entire image. However the implementation of this feature can vary vastly from camera to camera meaning that different cameras will make different decisions in the same lighting conditions. Evaluative metering usually is preferable when you use automatic or semiautomatic (Av aka Aperture Priority, and Tv aka Shutter priority) exposure setting.

Spot is the exact opposite of the Evaluative setting, rather than taking into account the whole of the image it tries to choose an exposure that is appropriate for whatever appears in the center of the image ignoring the rest of the image. This metering method is useful if you set the camera to manual exposure mode. A typical camera has dynamic range of about 6 ev steps. Areas for which camera show +3 ev in picture will be absolutely white, and areas with -3 ev will be absolutely black. The easiest way to set correct exposure will be to meter highlights (brightest white spots) in your composition and set exposure so that highlights read at +2.7 or +3 ev. 

Center weighted falls between these two settings, the camera chooses an exposure which will work well for the entire image, but places more importance on getting the exposure right for the center section.

====Exposure modes of digital camera====

Usually a digital camera has three types of exposure modes:
* Automatic modes (A, Autopicture, different picture modes (portrait, landscape etc.), P (Program)), in which the camera sets your aperture and shutter speed. 
* Semi-automatic or priority modes:
** Shutter priority (Tv) - you set the shutter speed and the camera sets the correct aperture.
** Aperture priority (Av) -  you set the aperture and the camera sets the shutter speed.
* Manual mode (M and B) - you set the aperture and shutter speed.

===How to achieve sharp digital photographs===

The reasons for the lack of sharpness in your digital photos can be attributed to one or more of the following reasons:

* Camera movement.
* Lack of proper focus.
* Using a &quot;soft&quot; camera setting.

'''Camera movement''' (or camera shake) usually comes from hand-holding your camera while using a slow shutter speed.  To minimize camera movement while using slow shutter speeds of 1/25th of a second or lower you should use a tripod.  If you don't have a tripod with you, try placing the camera on a flat surface and using the camera's self timer (obviously, this works best when there is not much movement in the scene).  Sometimes, if the lighting conditions are marginal where your shutter speed is right at 1/25th of a second, if you have a very steady hand, you can try holding your breath briefly as you snap the shutter.  You can also try manually increasing the shutter speed at the expense of using a wider aperture (lower f-stop).  Generally, a higher shutter speed decreases the effect of camera movement, but the lower f-stop decreases the depth of field and requires more careful focusing.

'''Lack of proper focus''' is another cause for lack of sharp photographs.  Fortunately, most digital cameras today come with autofocus capabilities.  In a few fixed lens cameras and in almost any digital SLR, the autofocus can be disabled allowing you to focus the lens manually.  Greater care must be exercised to make sure the object that you wish to be the center of attention in the photo is sharply focused.  

In more inexpensive cameras, the only focus adjustment may be a normal and macro mode.  The normal mode is usually represented by a mountain icon and the macro mode is usually represented by a flower icon.  If your camera only supports these two modes, make sure it is in the proper mode before you snap the shutter to achieve the sharpest photos. 

Camera with normal and macro focusing modes

'''Poor lighting conditions''' may cause your photos to lack definition and contrast.  You may notice that even when you use a tripod and with your camera handling the autofocus, your photographs may not appear as sharp as you might wish.  This is especially true for available light photographs where you do not wish to use a flash.  The fault for this lies not with your camera but with the scene itself.  In cases like this, try increasing the available light shining directly on the subject.  This can improve the photograph by allowing the edges to be more sharply defined against the background.

'''In camera sharpening''' can also affect the sharpness of an image.  Some higher end cameras offer a sharpness adjustment that usually ranges from +2 or +3 to -2 or -3 with zero in the center.  Increasing the sharpness can give you crisper looking images, and decreasing it will give a more &quot;soft focus&quot; effect.  Some photographers like to use a soft-focus effect when taking portraits, especially of women, because it tends to smooth out the appearance of the skin.  Increasing the sharpness will not compensate for camera shake or lack of proper focus.  Many photographers choose to leave the sharpness setting at zero and perform any sharpening in the post-processing stage.

===What's the slowest exposure time you can get away with ?===

&quot;Camera shake&quot; is what happens when you don't hold the camera sufficiently still. The longer the exposure time, the longer you have to hold the camera perfectly still, and the more chance there is for shake.

How long an exposure time you can use before being affected by camera shake depends very much on the individual.  With a lot of practice it's possible to hold the camera still for as much as half a second, but most people should be able to hold a camera still for 1/20 of a second with a little practice. Beginners should be able to hold for 1/25 of a seconds without problem.  

As a general rule of thumb, it is recommended to not use a shutter speed lower than the inverse of the focal length of the lens used.  For example, if you use a 50mm lens, try not to use a shutter speed slower than 1/50.

Another way to find out what shutter speed to use is by testing. 

# Pick something which will stay motionless and has straight lines which can easily be used to detect blurring. A good option would be a piece of paper which has large lettering printed on it, or use a suitable book cover.
# Be somewhere that has a reasonable amount of light (not necessary - but then all of your photos won't have the same brightness). If light is sufficient, feel free to turn off the flash to allow you to take photos faster.
# Switch your camera to exposure-time/shutterspeed priority mode.
# Set the camera to a reasonably long exposure time (say 1 second).
# Take a photo of your target in the way you normally take photos. Don't go out of your way to try to be more stable unless you are willing to do that every time you take a photo.
# Reduce the exposure time by one or two steps (how long this is in seconds will depend on your camera).
# Repeat the last two steps until you get down to about 1/30th of a second.

Now load the photos onto your computer, the one taken at 1 second will be blurred unless you are some sort of statue, but as the exposure time decreases the amount of blurring decreases.  Go through the photos in order until you find where the blurring is no longer noticeable. That photo will represent the maximum exposure time you can take photos without &quot;camera shake&quot;. Don't worry if you didn't note down the exposure times while taking the photos because most modern digital camera will store the information alongside the photo using what is known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF EXIF]. Most photo-manipulation packages can read this EXIF information as can many stand-alone EXIF-readers.

(If you use Windows XP you can get the EXIF information by right clicking on the photo and choosing properties, then the summary tab and clicking on advanced.)


The EXIF-data will include a lot of information, but the field you'll want to find is &quot;exposure time&quot; which, logically, will tell you the exposure time used when that photograph was taken.

Now you know what exposure-time you can get away with.  Many photographers have their own techniques for stabilizing the camera  so that they can use longer exposure times. These normally involve levering body parts against each other for greater stability. One common technique is to hold the camera directly against the brow or nose. Another is to try to lean against the nearest stable object like a tree, wall, etc., and then hugging your elbows into your chest. How well these work for you will very much depend on you, and of course, practicing.

Now that you know how long an exposure time you can get away with using your normal technique, you can start experimenting with other ways to hold your camera that will allow for longer exposure times without causing camera shake.

When taking shots with exposure times longer than you normally use, it's a good idea to take several shots if you have the spare memory. The more shots you take the better the chances that you manage to hold sufficiently still for one of them to come out well.


As a general rule of thumb, the ''longest'' exposure time that tends not to be affected by camera shake is about 1/60th of a second or 1/125th of a second. At those values, the camera shutter is operating fast enough that the image captured is typically not affected by camera shake. 

However, such values are typically achieved only at locations with good lighting, say, a typical afternoon outside. It is tricky to achieve this lighting indoors and photography at those shutter speeds without compromising on ISO (see below) or aperture is difficult at times

In addition to this, high end digital cameras are starting to appear with image stabilization or vibration reduction technologies. These ''can'' help to increase the longest exposure time to about 1/30th of a second or even 1/15th of a second when used right, and it is a huge advantage in indoors/ low light environment. Unfortunately, the technology is expensive at the moment, but it would eventually trickle into the more consumer-friendly models.

===The non-human approach to reducing camera shake===

Use a tripod or monopod. Failing the availability of either, find a flat, stable surface you can set your camera on. You may find that a small bean or wheat bag helps when placing your camera onto an uneven surface. If your camera allows you to set it off remotely or to use a timer, these also help reduce camera shake to an absolute minimum. 

Another technique that can be used for stabilizing your camera is, if you have a camera strap, turn your self into a bipod. This is done by steadying your legs and then pulling the camera away from yourself.

Some cameras have a function that attempts to compensate for camera shake by moving the sensor or parts of the lens.

===When is long exposure time useful ?===

Sometimes a long exposure time is the best way to increase the brightness of a shot in the low light situations. However longer exposure time can also increase &quot;noise&quot; in images. Many cameras have an automatic noise reduction system which kicks in at about 1.25-1.5 seconds. This means that the camera has to do more post-processing after the shot is taken so it may take slightly longer before the camera is ready to take another shot.

There are also times when you want to deliberately cause light streaks. Moving objects such as stars (for the ultra-long exposures) and cars (at night, when the headlamps are on) can create quite beautiful photographs when you utilize long exposure deliberately.

There can be cases when one wants to capture a portrait at night with usual exposure and flash no details in background can be captured. Here a longer exposure is taken with flash, flash can freeze and provide detail of person's face while longer exposure time will generate details of small lights in the background.

===Why do images become darker with short exposure times  ?===

Let's say you want to shoot a little leaguer running to first base, and not have it blurred.  If your camera is in a semi-automatic mode (for example shutter-speed priority), you can adjust the shutter-speed to be faster (i.e. shorter exposure time).  The camera then tries to modify the other settings (flash and aperture size) to make the image have an appropriate brightness.  

But there are limits to how far the camera can go. The amount the aperture can be opened is physically limited.  Once the aperture has been opened to its widest and the camera is out of other options, the brightness can't be increased further. This means that when you decrease the exposure time beyond that point the image will get darker, or &quot;underexposed&quot;.

Luckily your camera will be able to tell you when it reaches this point. How it does this varies from camera to camera but the most common way is to make the aperture size change to red on the display (you may have to have the LCD display turned on to see this).  On many cameras this information is only updated when the shutter button is pressed half way. Further details on this should be available from your camera manual.

===At larger apertures, why do images become brighter ?===

Just as in the case above, where short exposure time images can become darker, or underexposed, when you exceed the camera's ability to &quot;open up&quot; the aperture, the camera is limited by how much the aperture can be closed down. So, in very bright conditions, if the camera cannot close down further, images will be brighter, or &quot;overexposed&quot;. Again, most cameras have a way of warning you when this point is reached, and unless in manual mode, will not allow you to shoot.

===Why should I take control of exposure time ?===
[[Image:Shutter_speed_waterfall.gif|frame|Shutter speed can have a dramatic impact on the appearance of moving objects. Changes in background blurring are apparent from the need to adjust the aperture size to achieve proper exposure.]]
Hopefully  by now you understand the basics of exposure time and how it affects your shots. If you have shots that you've taken before that have turned out blurred now is a good time to go and have a look at their EXIF information and pay attention to the environment the photos were taken in. Almost certainly, your blurred photos will have been taken in low light situations and the EXIF information will reveal that the exposure time was fairly long (longer than your &quot;stability limit&quot;). 

You should now be able to make educated guesses as to what your camera's automatic system was doing that resulted in blurred images. The camera detected low light so it probably tried to compensate by turning the flash on and opening the aperture as far as it could.  However, even after doing this, the camera thought the photo would be too dark, so it increased the exposure time. Here it made the fatal mistake! Since the camera doesn't know how stable you can hold the camera or if it is on a tripod, it assumes that you can hold perfectly still for as long as you want.

Since you know that's not true, this is a perfect example of a situation where you should step in and take control. In most situations you don't want a blurred photo, (though you do have to consider what you want). If, for example, you would prefer a darker photo but without blur or camera shake, then all you have to do is switch to shutter-speed priority mode, set the exposure time to a setting which you are comfortable with, and let the camera handle the rest of the settings. 

What if you want the image brighter? Well, the simple answer is to increase the lighting.  If you're indoors, then turn the lights on if they aren't on already or set up what you want to shoot near window light. If that's not an option, you can start playing with other settings such as the ISO. Increasing the ISO can increase the brightness of the shot by increasing the camera's sensitivity to light, but at the expense of causing more noise to appear in the image (more on ISO later). 

All of these choices involve compromise, and your camera can't choose which compromise to make for you as it doesn't know why you want the photo and what's important about it. Only you can make that decision, and that's why you have to take control.

===Why change the aperture ?===
[[File:Page 01.jpg|250px|thumb|An example showing how a narrow depth of field can impact a photo.]]
In general, cameras are fairly good at automatically changing the aperture to deal with the light situation.

However, as mentioned earlier, if you want to increase Depth of Field (the range around your subject that remains in focus) or improve the focus on distance shots, you might want to step in and make the aperture smaller.

Without getting into a lot of theory and mathematics, aperture widths are measured in what are called &quot;F-Stops&quot; written like this: f/1.0, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6 f/8.0, f/11, f/16 etc. As these numbers get larger, the aperture gets smaller. So from these numbers f/1.0 means the aperture is the widest (wide open in fact), while f/16.0 is the smallest.  When you increase the size of the aperture by setting it to a lower numbered f-stop, it is called '''opening up'''.  When you decrease the size of the aperture by setting it to a higher numbered f-stop, it is called '''stopping down'''.

Put your camera into manual aperture priority and move the dial back and forth to adjust it.  You will see the numbers in the view finder change as you open and close, and can see the range of options your specific camera has.  Each of these numbers represents one &quot;stop&quot; more or less of light reaching the camera.  Another, more indirect way of changing the aperture, is to switch to time mode and do the same drill, observing that the time notation changes for the amount of the light reaching the camera.  The numbers show what part of a second the aperture is open.  For example, t/90 means 1/90th of a second.  You will see the numbers change something like this: t/90, t/125, t/180, t/250, t/350, t/500.  Again, as the numbers change, so does the amount of light-- there's one &quot;stop&quot; less light with each shorter exposure.

If you use aperture-priority mode on your camera, beware of the same problems that you can get in fully automatic mode. Your camera may increase the exposure time significantly to compensate for less light through the aperture, so make sure the exposure time isn't too long when taking the shot.

If it is too long, then you have to use a tripod or other method to stabilize your camera, and switch to manual mode.   This will mean that you have to set both the aperture and exposure time by hand. But that's not too hard, now that you see that the numbers simply represent step changes in the amount of light reaching the camera. 

Remember, as shown above, each step increment change of either the f/stop or time exposure represents one &quot;stop&quot; of light.  As long as the change is proportional between these measurements, the amount of light is the same.  I.e.  If you open the lens up more, shorten the time the same number of steps to still get the same amount of light... if you close the lens more, increase the time the same number of steps to still get the same amount of light. 

So, here's how you can set manually without fancy light meters.  Simply find out what the camera's light meter is recommending in the automatic mode.  For example, it may think you need t/250 with f/8.  But you want to get a greater depth of field, say f/16.  That is two steps smaller aperture than f/8, hence, two stops less light.  So in manual mode, set f/16 (which is two clicks less light than recommended to get the right amount of light) and then INCREASE the amount of light two stops above what the automatic setting recommended, in this case, moving two clicks from t/250 to t/125. Actually, you can simply think of it as turning two &quot;clicks&quot; up or down for each setting and don't worry about the numbers.  

Again, a simple solution for manual mode is to take the automatic mode setting, then switch to manual and &quot;click&quot; the same number of steps up or down to get your new aperture and speed settings.

Most camera lenses do not produce images of the best resolution with the aperture wide-open (e.g. f/1.4 on a 50 f/1.4 lens). Stopping down (increasing the f-stop setting) can improve their resolution, often drastically. This can be referred to MTF charts.  Using f/8 or f/11 on most lenses produces an image with fine detail. Beyond this would actually degrade images due to diffraction, so don't overly stop-down unless you need greater depth of field.


The major trade off a photographer will encounter when fiddling with the aperture is this: low aperture allows more light in, but at the cost of Depth of Field; high aperture allows less light in, but have more Depth of Field.

Normally, you would want to shoot with aperture as low as possible, as not having enough light is typically more common than having too much light. Under some circumstances though, a low aperture gives more headaches than the increased light. One very obvious case is when you are taking photographs in macro mode. 

In macrophotography, you are pushing the camera to capture details on a small object, typically close to the lens. In these cases, when the object is close to the lens, ''Depth of Field is critical''. Having insufficient Depth of Field means only part of the object is in focussed. This is good if it's your artistic intention, but that's rarely the intention.

In these cases, you have to stop down to higher aperture numbers, and balance the trade offs elsewhere. Normally these come out from shutter speed (longer shutter speed) or ISO (higher ISO settings), which is why macrophotography tends to occur in controlled environment.

Thus, as a general rule of thumb, an aperture of around f/4 is probably adequate for normal photography; anything lower and you begin to get noticeable loss of Depth-of-Field. At f/2.8, the Depth-of-Field is visibly constrained to fairly narrow bands.

For macrophotography, apertures around f/8 or f/10 or even higher are common. such high aperture values would mean a corresponding increase in shutter speeds.

There is another aspect of apertures that may not be obvious to casual users. Higher apertures gives you more ''Depth-of-Field'', which means more things are in focus -- ''which means you have more room for errors in terms of focussing''.

This is most obvious when you have a low-aperture lens, shooting a distance (really distant! Say, 150~200+ metres away) object, in poor light and/ or on a moving platform.

(Aside: One has to wonder why a photographer is in these conditions, but we digress... )

Even with autofocussing technologies in today's camera, getting a sharp picture in those circumstances is difficult. Autofocussing relies largely on contrast and not so much on image context, so it is easy for the autofocus to focus on the wrong portion of the subject.

If your aperture is set high enough, this isn't an issue; ''depth-of-field'' will ensure your subject is in focus. However, if you are shooting at low apertures -- say, f/2.8 --
the low ''depth-of-field'' will mean you need to be very precise in your focussing to ensure the subject is in focus. Make a mistake (easy enough when your lens is hand-held and shooting at 150+ metres), and your subject slips out of the ''depth-of-field'' and you end up with a blurred shot.

As such, using a high aperture gives you more margin of error when it comes to focussing on a subject. As usual, you have to adjust for the (generally) lower amounts of light a higher aperture implies, and it becomes a balancing act.

===Changing what automatic/semi-automatic mode aims for===

When you use automatic, shutter-priority, or aperture-priority modes the camera has a fixed idea about what exposure (brightness) it should aim for. What if you want to change this without having to use manual mode ?

Luckily most cameras come with a feature known as &quot;exposure compensation&quot; which allows you to underexpose or overexpose shots easily. However how much you should change the exposure depends on the situation and on your camera, so the best way you can learn is by experimentation.

Many digital cameras tend to overexpose and it's common for photographers to use an exposure compensation of -1/3 to -2/3 as default.

Many photographers use &quot;bracketing&quot;, this is the name given to when you take several photos with a range of exposures to ensure one photo comes out with the correct exposure. Automatic mode normally gets fairly close to a good exposure so taking photos at one level above and below its defaults will probably get you a good shot.

===Speeding up recovery time ?===

recovery time (also called latency) is the time taken between shots (i.e. after you take a photo how long do you have to wait before you take another)

You can speed up the recovery by turning some or all of the following things off,

* compression
* image sharpening
* flash
* getting a better memory card

Latency time is one of the downfalls of point and shoot type digital cameras, but as time goes by and technology improves the latency time has been reduced dramatically. More advanced digital SLR cameras are as fast as their film counterparts ever were with some professional SLRs offering up to eight frames per second with a buffer of forty frames.

===Image sharpening===

The general opinion is that image sharpening should be left to the post-processing stage. Some cameras offer in-built sharpening, however these are normally less sophisticated than those available on most photo-manipulation packages. There is no technical advantage in using in-built sharpening over using a computer based sharpening tool. Actually image sharpening must be the last step in image manipulation, so if you will need some post processing the in camera sharpening will only decrease the quality of the final image.

The canon user manual will suggest which settings to use with their higher end digital SLRs.

===Photo effects/Color modes===
[[File:Photograph.sept1895.jpg|thumb|Sepia was a technique used to preserve photos and is now a sought-after style for some situations.]]
These let you take shots in Black and White, Sepia, vivid mode, etc. The basic rule is don't use them, shoot in colour and apply these effects in post-processing if you want them. Like with sharpening, your computer is able to take advantage of more sophisticated algorithms resulting in a better end-result.

===White balance===

White balance often confuses beginners; after all, white is white, isn't it?

Actually, it isn't. Your camera sees what colour an object is; unfortunately this won't be the same colour as humans see. This is because the human brain makes people see non-white colours as white.

The colour of an object is dependant on the light source, however humans automatically adjust so that anything which roughly combines the primary light colours together appears white.

&quot;White-balance&quot; is the name given to the technique cameras use to try and depict the image as humans see it. Most cameras will have at least three options (daylight, fluorescent, and tungsten) and may have many more which are designed to adjust to the light source.

Some cameras will also have a custom option, the custom option will allows you to setup a &quot;White-balance&quot; for a specific lighting situation. The way it works is that you have to show it something which is white (or more often a grey card) and using that it makes corrections to the photos taken.

Luckily automatic white-balance detection is fairly sophisticated so most of the time leaving white-balance on auto mode will get you the result you want.

===Depth of Field and achieving blurring effects===
[[File:DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of a very shallow depth of field.]]
The [[wikipedia:Depth_of_field|depth of field]] (DOF) is the distance in front of and behind the subject which appears to be in focus. Areas which are out of DOF look blurred. Sometimes it's very useful to have shallow DOF to separate the subject from the background (and/or foreground). Photographers try to get the subject in focus and the background slightly blurred. 

DOF for given camera depends on three factors:
* Distance to subject. Getting closer to subject will make DOF shallower;
* Lens focal length. The longer focal length will make DOF shallower;
* Aperture. The larger aperture will make DOF shallower;

Despite there are three factors which affect DOF, only aperture can help you control it. If you choose a longer lens to get the full subject in frame you need to increase the distance to your subject and these two factors will compensate effects of each other. 

So to have shallow DOF you need:
* fill as much of the frame as possible with your subject (it is usually easier with a long lens)
* set big aperture (f4.0, f2.8 or even f1.4 if you have such lens)

Worth noting that cameras with bigger sensors will have shallower DOF for the same f-number, because of the same focal length of the lens you will need to get nearer to your subject to fill the frame. So with a digital SLR getting shallow DOF is much easier than with a compact Point &amp; shoot camera.

It is also possible, relatively easily, to introduce blurring at the post-processing stage although the effect may not be as good compared to that done in-camera.

===Taking infra-red photos===
[[File:Infrared 09073-kalamis.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of a photo taken by a converted Sony DSC-F828.]]
Some digital cameras have sensors which are capable of detecting infrared, if your camera is capable of doing so then you should be able to obtain a infrared filter relatively cheaply (about £10 GBP/ $15 USD) which allows you to take infrared photos.

The simplest way you can tell if your camera is infrared-sensitive is to point an infrared source into your lens and see if it is visible on your LCD screen. Almost any infrared source can be used including remote controls (point the emitter at your lens and hold down a button on your remote).


A more technical explanation follows:

All digital camera sensors are capable of detecting infrared; this is actually a problem with early digital cameras, because they pick up infrared and as such alters the captured image.

To deal with this issue, camera manufacturers build something called a ''hot mirror'' into digital cameras. Effectively this is an IR filter, designed to filter out IR so that the final images are not affected by the extra 'light' coming in.

''Hot mirrors'' aren't 100% effective, thus some cameras are more sensitive to IR than others. Of course, if you are daring enough, you can open up your digital camera and replace the ''hot mirror'' with a glass of matching optical index, '''but this is not recommended and not advised'''. Doing that will almost certainly void your warranty, and sometimes break the camera.

IR filters are filters which filter ''out'' non-IR light; the filter itself appears black or reddish-black. When you hold it up to a light source, you may see a dim image of the light source showing through, but pretty much nothing else will show up.

But attach the filter to a IR-sensitive camera, and when you take photographs, you will see some images captured. How does this work?

Essentially, it's the same idea how photographs are taken. IR light are reflected off objects the same way 'normal' light is, and the IR filter will remove the 'normal' light, leaving the camera to interpret only the IR light. This results in an image that can be eerie in the extreme: Trees are white (IR reflects off leaves strongly), dark clothing becomes white and vice versa, things simply aren't what you expect.

IR photography does have some issues to take note of. First, IR light tends to be lower in intensity, so you need to compensate with lower aperture, longer shutter speed, and/or higher ISO. Also, IR focuses slightly differently from normal, which is why some SLR lens have IR markings for them. So you may end up with slightly out-of-focused images.

The last issue is not technical, but moral. IR can and does reflect straight through clothing, especially thin clothing. This can lead to some morally questionable photography, although it's really really much harder to achieve than people are led to believe. The ability does exist though and it has to be left to the individual photographer's morals to determine what to take in IR.

===Example shots===

* An action shot 
:: Obviously we want a short exposure time here, to compensate we would open up the aperture. We might also use the flash, but remember using the flash will mean you have to wait for the flash to warm up/fire.

* A landscape shot
:: This time we'd want a large aperture as we want to photograph a large area. If we want to increase the brightness of our shot then we'll need to increase the exposure time (as the flash probably won't be powerful enough to light up our scene). In a landscape shot the most likely source of motion is the camera person, so it's best to take these shots using a tripod to avoid motion.

* A framed painting
:: If there is glass in front of the painting you will almost certainly want to turn the flash off otherwise you'll get effects like this:
::[[image: frameref.jpg]]
::Which obviously you want to avoid. Using a wide-aperture is an obvious move, if you have a tripod or otherwise stable place where you can place the camera a long-exposure time will also help. If you still don't have enough light then you might consider increasing the ISO but going over ISO 400 is likely to cause a noticeable noise effect on the final image. 

::Another solution would be to take the photo at an angle to reduce the reflection of the flash, however &quot;straightening&quot; the photo in post-processing may take more effort than it is worth.

*Glass enclosed exhibits
:: Most of what we've said about framed paintings also applies here, however you're more likely to be able to get away with taking photos at angles. Consider the following two images which are both taken with flash,
[[Image: dodoflash.jpg]]
[[Image: dodoflash2.jpg]]
:: In the second the reflection from the glass is almost unnoticeable, while in the first it destroys the balance of the image. However all is not lost in the first image either as the majority of the flash reflection happens away from our main target we should be able to remove most of the flash reflections in post-processing:
[[Image: dodoflash3.jpg]]
:Another problem with this sort of image is that the glass can often reflect other items in the room including the photographer. One way to avoid this is to take the photo while holding the camera very close to the glass. A secondary advantage of this approach is that you can make it appear that there is no glass between yourself and the exhibit for example in the following photo,

[[Image:Siberischer tiger de.jpg|400px]]

Another way to dramatically reduce reflections is with the use of a polarizer.

*Portraits
:: Use a low depth of field and try to avoid using an on-camera flash. If you can't increase the surrounding lighting use an external (preferably bounce flash) flash instead. Using the on-camera flash will create harsh shadowing and is responsible for red-eye.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

'''Easy Wedding Soup''' is a simple variation on Italian Wedding Soup that requires only four ingredients and water.

==Ingredients==

* 6 cups [[Cookbook:Broth|chicken broth]] (from [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cubes]] is fine)
* 2 cups [[cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 10 oz packet frozen [[cookbook:spinach|spinach]]
* 12 oz spicy [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] (pre-cooked)
* 3 tbsp acini di pepe (''pastina'', little bead-like [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]])

==Procedure==
# Bring broth and water to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] in 4 quart [[cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]].
# Add frozen spinach.
# Cut sausage into small pieces.
# Add sausage and acini di pepe
# Bring back to boil and allow to boil for 10 minutes.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
* Calorie content may vary depending on the specific ingredients you use; 80 kcal is reasonable.
* The spicy sausage will impart more subtle flavor to the soup, making further spicing unnecessary.  Using different types of sausage will vastly change the character of the soup.
* This recipe may require salt if you use home made chicken stock.  Bouillon cubes tend to be heavily salted already.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of using certain theoretical approaches to instructional design?

'''Behaviorism'''&lt;br&gt;

Weakness -the learner may find themselves in a situation where the stimulus for the correct response does not occur, therefore the learner cannot respond. - A worker who has been conditioned to respond to a certain cue at work stops production when an anomaly occurs because they do not understand the system.

Strength - the learner is focused on a clear goal and can respond automatically to the cues of that goal. - W.W.II pilots were conditioned to react to silhouettes of enemy planes, a response which one would hope became automatic.

'''Cognitivism'''&lt;br&gt;

Weakness - the learner learns a way to accomplish a task, but it may not be the best way, or suited to the learner or the situation. For example, logging onto the internet on one computer may not be the same as logging in on another computer.

Strength - the goal is to train learners to do a task the same way to enable consistency. - Logging onto and off of a workplace computer is the same for all employees; it may be important do an exact routine to avoid problems.

'''Constructivism'''&lt;br&gt;

Weakness - in a situation where conformity is essential divergent thinking and action may cause problems. Imagine the fun Revenue Canada would have if every person decided to report their taxes in their own way - although, there probably are some very &quot;constructive&quot; approaches used within the system we have.

Strength - because the learner is able to interpret multiple realities, the learner is better able to deal with real life situations. If a learner can problem solve, they may better apply their existing knowledge to a novel situation.

== Four Teleological Orders ==

According to Quentin Smith (1981), the four teleological orders are the relations of one aim to another as (1) a “means to” it, (2) a “part of” it, (3) a “concretion” of it, and (4) as “subsumed” under it. These teleological orders interconnect three different types of aims: (1) ends, (2) goals and (3) purposes.
Smith uses the term “ends” to refer to those aims that are directly pursued in voluntary actions. Ends are terms of one or both of the teleological relationships that we are designating as the “means to” relationship and the “part of” relationship. The ends that are terms of these relationships are either physical ends, mental ends, or interpersonal ends. 
1. Physical ends are either to alter the physical structure of my surroundings (such as to saw a branch in half), or to alter and move my body for its own sake (as is the case when I engage in exercise). 
2. Mental ends are not to change the physical environment or my body, but to “bring to my mind” ideas, images or memories. Examples of mental ends are “to solve a mathematical problem,” “to recall a person’s name,” “to read a poem,” and “to conceptualize in an accurate manner a vague insight.” 
3. Interpersonal ends are to influence or affect the consciousness of another person. 
Goals are formally defined as aims that are constituted by two or more ends. The smallest scale goals are constituted by the fewest ends, and the largest scale goals are constituted by thousands of ends. Goals differ in essence from ends in that they are mediate aims of voluntary actions, whereas ends are immediate aims of these actions. An end is immediately and directly attained by an action: it is the volitional activity and striving that either are the end itself, or that bring about the end as their direct result. A voluntary action, however, cannot immediately attain a goal. A goal must be attained by a series of voluntary actions, such that they become attained only through the attainment of a series of complete actional ends. In this sense the attainment of the goal is mediate: it is mediated by the attainment of a series of actional ends.
The explanation of this definition of goals involves a distinction of goals from complete actional ends. Complete actional ends differ from goals in two respects. Complete actional ends are such that: (1) they are continually posited from the moment they are willed by a volition until the moment they have been completely attained by the subsequent voluntary action. This entails that these ends (2) are pursued in a continuous and uninterrupted action and striving, such that I act and strive without intermission from the moment I will the end to be attained until the moment I attain it. 

== Goals ==

Goals, on the other hand: 
(1) are not continually posited from the moment they are willed until the moment they are attained. Rather they are posited as my aims at different times. The pursuit of a goal is interspersed with modes of behavior that do not aim at attaining the goal; these modes of behavior may be actions that aim to attain other goals, or they may be non-actional modes of behavior, such as passions, moods, periods of day-dreaming, sleeping, etc. 
(2) Corresponding to this discontinuous positing of the goal, the voluntary activities and strivings that aim to realize the goal are engaged in at different times.
This definition of goals indicates that they differ from ends in the manner in which they are posited and pursued. They do not necessarily differ in their contents (although they usually do). This occasional similarity between their contents is apparent in the smallest scale goals and the complete actional ends. At one time I may pursue and attain one aim in a single voluntary action, and at another time I may pursue and attain a similar aim in two or three different actions. In the first case, since the aim is attained in a single action, it is nothing more than the complete end of this action. In the second case, it is the mediate aim of several actions: it is the goal to which the several actional ends are ordered. 
This distinction between ends and goals enables us to note a fundamental difference in kind among the various aims of actions. This difference is usually overlooked. For example, Sartre does not distinguish between the different kinds of aims we empirically desire. For Sartre (L’Etre et le Neaot; Paris: Librairie Gallimard, 1943), “drinking a glass of water” and “conquering Gaul” are undifferentiated instances of the aims we can empirically desire. However we believe there is a fundamental difference in kind between these two aims. The aim of “drinking a glass of water” is achieved in a single and continuous action, whereas the aim of “conquering Gaul” is achieved by a vast number of such actions. The former aim is an end, the immediate aim of one action, whereas the latter aim is a goal, the mediate aim of a number of actions.
The relation of goals to purposes is different in kind than the relation of ends to goals. Goals are neither “means to” nor “parts of” purposes, but “concretions” of purposes. Goals “make concrete” the “abstractions” that are purposes. Specifically, goals are the concrete determinations of undetermined instances of universals. It is the nature of purposes to be undetermined instances of universals, and it is the nature of goals to be the particular determinations of these instances. Whereas ends and goals constitute the unique individuality of our actions, purposes are the unconditioned meanings of our actions. They are the ultimate “reason” or “what for” of our actions. If it is asked why or “what for” a person is engaging in an action, the final reason he can give is that he is doing it in order to realize a purpose. While goals are the meaning of ends, in that ends are pursued for the reason that they realize goals, purposes are the meaning of goals, for purposes are the “reason why” we pursue goals.
 [[Image:Wikkkki.jpg]]
If we consider this order and distinction between these terms and their relationships, then the order of things may be presented in the way similar to graph above.  Once the purpose of the action is formulated in the mind of a person, he/she pursues the goal(s) required to be accomplished, in order to achieve definite (and desired) end(s), with ultimate result of fulfilling this purpose. 
Ends, goals and purposes, as they are interrelated by the four teleological orders, constitute a teleological structure of voluntary actions. According to this interpretation of goal structure, the goal is mediate aim of a number of actions. Hence, it consists of the series of actions intended to achieve proximal and distal effects. If we use Smith’s example, adapted from Sartre, aim of “conquering Gaul” requires series of actions. In order to achieve this military aim, Julius Caesar might have devised this series of actions: 
•	Divide the territory into areas of responsibility between legions, in order to prevent communication of Gaul tribes. 
•	Ascertain key terrain features that need to be controlled by legions, to establish camps and uninterrupted lines of communication and supplies for the troops, etc. 
These hypothetical actions of Caesar would represent the series of activities designed to achieve proximal effects. Distal effect of this series of actions would still be, of course, “conquering Gaul.” 
The structure above has five levels, each level being an interrelationship between some of these aims. The relationship between ends and other ends constitute the level that lies at the basis of this structure: the “part of” and “means to” order between ends is the irreducible foundation of voluntary and aim—directed action. Founded upon this basic level of the interconnection of ends, there is a second level consisting of the “part of” and “means to” relations between ends and goals. And upon this level there is based a third level: the “part of” and “means to” relations that connect goals to other goals. These relations serve as the foundation for a fourth level of this teleological structure: the “concretion” order that links goals to purposes. Upon this level there is built the uppermost level, which is the “subsumption” order that connects purposes to other purposes. The final purpose in this “subsumption” order is the empty purpose of “attaining some purpose.” This is the most general aim of voluntary action, and with it the teleological relationships terminate. Any phenomenon that is to become an aim of human action can only do so through being integrated in an immanent fashion within this interconnected teleological structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Despite appearing to be an impossibility on first observation, it is quite possible to keep bees in residential or even heavily residential areas. Though it is not necessarily the easiest or most successful method of beekeeping, residential beekeeping is by no means an unfeasible act. It is often possible to keep bees in the most crowded suburban areas, within small residential lots or even on the rooftops of mid sized buildings. If enough effort is made, it is usually possible to keep bees in some capacity within an urban environment. For the most success, beekeepers of this ilk must adapt and manage in such a way as to cause the least amount inconvenience for both their bees and their neighbors.

Because of the factors affecting residential beekeepers, they will almost always act as a [[Beekeeping/Hobby Beekeeping| hobbyist beekeeper]], or in some areas rent a hive from a local commercial beekeper. Due to limited amount of space and resources, it is recommended that residential beekeepers start small with just two or three hives, and only expand once a proper feel for the local area has been achieved. However, some residential beekeepers also have other apiaries, in which they can create a small [[Beekeeping/Sideline Beekeeping| sideline]] business, but rarely do they go the [[Beekeeping/Commercial Beekeeping| commercial]] route.

Before keeping bees in a residential area, be sure to know local laws, requirements and regulations. Some areas don’t allow beekeeping and other areas require a permit to be purchased. If you are on good terms with your neighbors and wish to remain as such, it may be a good idea to speak with them before committing yourself to keeping bees in a populated area.

==Hive Placement Factors==
When working the urban environment with bees, particular attention must be taken to properly place the hive to eliminate or increase certain [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Behavior| behaviors]] and actions of the bees.
===Out of Sight, Out of Mind===
Chances are, a new residential beekeeper’s neighbors will not be as excited about bees as the new neighborhood beekeeper. Keeping this in mind, it is often a good idea to keep any hives out of direct line of sight, or disguise hives that are out in the open. Sometimes all it takes is moving a hive from a front or peripheral yard into the backyard. Keeping hives out of sight may eliminate blame for any sort of insect stings, and in the extreme case [[Beekeeping/Vandals| vandalism]]. Most people will not even realize that a neighbor keeps bees if a hive is well placed, which may divert a great deal of stress and controversy. This is not to say that neighbors shouldn’t be allowed to know about beekeepers in the area, but often they must first be appeased and educated before they would be agreeable to this new possibly threatening circumstance.

===Flight Pattern===
In general, bees exiting the hive to gather food will fly between three to ten feet from the ground. Having bees fly in people’s path will likely cause a great deal of unnecessary alarm. Planting tall plants or placing a fence a few feet in front of your hives will force the bees to choose a flight pattern that will take them above head level. Some beekeepers may even choose to locate their hives on a rooftop to eliminate conflicting paths.
===Hive Location===
Preferably, colonies of bees should be kept in a location in which they receive a full day’s sunlight. Shaded and cold bees tend to be more aggressive and ready to sting. Though it may not always be possible, the main hive entrance should be pointed to the southeast to get the best of the early morning sun. 
A placement of hives near neighbor’s yards is unadviseable, especially if the neighbors have young children who play outdoors. It is also advised that bees be kept away from swimming pools, as they may attempt to make it their primary water source.

==Resources==
One of the most important issues of beekeeping is having the proper resources for the bees.
===Foraging===
During most times of the foraging season, bees will be able to find adequate supplies of nectar and pollen for survival. Keep in mind that most bees choose to forage within a two-mile radius but ten is not unheard of. A two mile radius means that the bees will cover over 8,000 acres of land. Within this land, even in residential areas, many people have gardens, fruit trees and decorative gardens. So foraging may be no problem whatsoever to residential beekeepers. 
===Supplementing===
Occasionally, it may be necessary to supplement the diets of residential bees. But the same guidelines may be followed as with any other form of beekeeping.
===Water===
Depending on location, water may be a scarcity to the bees of a residential beekeeper. Bees require water to regulate hive temperature and for diluting honey for feeding. Water is often collected from the nearest source, though bees seem to prefer shallow pools of warmer standing water. Because of this, it is advisable to supply bees with a source of water so they do not attempt to drink from neighboring pools or birdbaths. Keep in mind that during the hotter parts of the year in some regions of the US, a single healthy colony of bees may use up to a gallon or more of water a day. Some beekeepers have a faucet slowly dripping over a shallow dish or plate. Once bees start using a specific water source, it may be difficult to prevent them from returning. It is often best to provide a non-diminishing supply of water near the hive before the bees begin flying.

==Working The Colony==
Whenever a beehive is opened or in some way disturbed, a potentially dangerous reaction may occur. To diminish the possibility of negative action, it is advisable to follow a set of guidelines when working the hive. 
===Be Aware of Nectar Flows===
A nectar flow may be the best possible time in which to work a colony. During a good flow, many of the [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| workers]] will be out of the hive foraging. This diminished population offers the best time to examine the colony. Be aware of the nectar flows in your area, though this may not be possible without good observations for several years. During a time of nectar dearth, bees may be more defensive and more populous in the hive.

===When to Open the Hive===
Weather and time of day hold a large influence over the temperament of a colony of bees. Opening a hive during non-peak condition, such as early morning, a rainy or windy day, or during cold weather should be avoided whenever possible. To minimize the likelihood of problems, hives should only be worked on ideal warm sunny days. This however, is also the time of day when neighbors tend to be out and about. When possible only work the hive when no one else is around the immediate vicinity.

===Expect Observers===
When working a hive, neighbors, especially children, may become interested in what you are doing. If you don’t mind an audience, be sure to have some extra protective gear on hand so some of your spectators may get a closer look or even help out. If you don’t have any protective gear to share be sure that spectators stay a reasonable distance away so they won’t chance getting harmed. Now would also be a good time to casually educate those around you in the art and science of beekeeping. A beekeeper, can often use a good assistant, some one who repeatedly chooses to watch may be just that person. It may even be a good idea to invite friends and neighbors to learn and enjoy your hobby. Just be prepared to answer many questions.

===Avoid Robbing===
Honey, nectar or hive parts exposed, or even leaving a colony open for a few minutes may encourage a [[Beekeeping/Robbing| robbing]] situation, which will likely lead to many defensive, ready-to-sting bees flying around. Always seal hives and cover attractive hive parts as soon as possible when working to avoid this situation.

===Avoid Gloves===
Wearing gloves while beekeeping can be a bad idea. Stings on hands are easily removed and the resulting pain quickly subsides. Generally stings on gloves are not felt, but alarm pheromones are released each time and will cause other bees in the hive to attack. Often this will build and the beekeeper will ignore a cycle that the residential beekeeper should avoid. Wearing gloves may cause the beekeeper to miss one of the best identifiers of colony mood. Working barehanded, a beekeeper is less clumsy and will be less likely to allow the bees to get out of control.

==Tips==
;Gentle Bees :When keeping bees in residential areas it is important to keep gentle bees. Select a [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| race of bees]] that is known to act non-aggressively. If a colony becomes temperamental, don’t hesitate to re-queen it.
;Consider Your Neighbors :It is best to keep your neighbors happy, though you may be within your legal right to keep bees on your property, an angry neighbor can cause severe problems for a beekeeper. For more information on this subject, see the [[Beekeeping/Gaining Support| Gaining Support of Friends and Neighbors]] module.
;Avoid Swarming :Even though a swarm of bees is often no threat, neighbors will not perceive it as such. 
;Join Hobbyist Associations :Often a residential beekeeper does not have the room or the need for some seasonal beekeeping equipment, by joining an association it may be possible to share such equipment an thereby eliminate some cost. If such an association is not available consider paying a small fee to a beekeeper with the proper equipment for rental or usage.
;Hive Design :Because a residential beekeeper often has differing requirements, you may want to consider alternate hive designs such as a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], which are known to be easier to work, cheap, and to encourage gentler bees.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== STRATEGIES TO ADOPT E-LEARNING ==

'''Incorporate e-learning or blended learning into the corporate strategy by linking training to a business goal.''' 

*It is imperative that training needs are clearly defined and matched to business goals. Management must then communicate loud and clear these strategic messages to all departments, champion its initiation, and maintain its support until results are achieved. 
*Of course, one needs to be mindful of the concept of &quot;scope creep,&quot; in which too many project needs are tied to a learning solution that tries to answer all departmental needs but ends up never fully adopted by any department. 

'''Match the appropriate e-learning learning methodologies to training needs.'''

*The foundation of organization-wide e-learning is the licensing of a learning management system (LMS). At its simplest level, an LMS registers students, runs courses, and generates reports on their completion. At more complex levels, an LMS performs many other functions, such as creating certification tracks, allowing the entry of offline learning results, and so on. 

*Buyers should only license systems that support either the SCORM (Sharable Courseware Object Reference Model) or AICC (Aviation Industry Computer Based Training Committee) standard for e-learning programming, and should only license content that is compliant with those standards. Most systems, but not all, comply with at least one of these standards. Compliance with one of the two is adequate, since most content providers will provide content for either. 

*Buyers need to be aware of another standard that isn't related to content production, the Standard Object Access Protocol (SOAP). This enables an LMS to integrate with a human resources information system. This integration can enable anything from the automatic updating of employee information from a program such as PeopleSoft to more complex analyses of job performance and training results. 

*A newer product is the Learning Content Management System (LCMS). This enables the storage of content pieces such as images, videos and documents in the system with the purpose of making them available for content creation by the organization.

'''ELearning Defined'''

E-Learning is not just about how technology is used in education.  It is a much broader term that has come to include both technical and social dynamics.  It is not a stretch to say that our society is moving (has moved) from an industrial age to an information age based on knowledge.  E-Learning will have an increasing role in this shift.  Some people think of E-Learning as just online or web learning, but it is a very narrow view.  There is more to it than just learning with computers and more elements makeup E-Learning than just websites.  Cognitive Design Solutions (CDS) created three different levels of E-Learning definitions.  The three levels are: Internet enabled instruction, Technology-based instruction and Learning tools of the New Economy. [http://www.cognitivedesignsolutions.com/images/elearn_define2.gif]
*In internet enabled instruction definitions dealing with networking technology would be found.
*The Technology-based instruction includes methodology issues such as:  instructional design, best practices and collaboration elements.
*Learning tools of the New Economy look at cultural and social impacts that are being advanced by technology.[http://www.cognitivedesignsolutions.com/ELearning/E-Learning1.htm]

Basically, what CDS is saying is that to do E-Learning justices one must look at the whole makeup of E-Learning (the technology, methodology and social elements). These three elements have interaction with each other to produce new networks to support learning.  When instituted correctly, E-Learning, provides a new array of tools and practices that can add value to a traditional learning setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Defining Visual Rhetoric

{{cquote|Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing [discovering] in any given case the available [appropriate] means of persuasion|30px|30px|Aristotle|qtd. in Bizzell 160}}

{{cquote|The duty and office of Rhetoric is to apply Reason to Imagination for the better moving of the will|30px|30px|Bacon|qtd. in Bizzell 629}}

According to the rhetoric page on this wiki site, rhetoric is the art of persuasion using language.  The classical philosophers used rhetoric in their speeches to persuade people to their point of view.  The art uses style and many different formulas to make the most pertinent argument to convince their audience.  The classical sophist, Gorgias, said rhetoric had the power to create images in a person's mind.  Quintilian also believed that rhetoric presented images into people's minds (Blakesley 2).  Visual rhetoric is actually representations and images.  It is using images to convince people instead of using words.  
 
	Images have just begun to be analyzed as rhetoric.  They have surrounded people since cavemen began drawing pictures on cave walls.  Images today are used in [[../Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric|Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric]] advertisements, schoolbooks, movies, magazines, paintings, the list could go on forever because images are everything we see.  The visual surrounds people all the time.  The definition of visual rhetoric depends upon the scholar, but it can be any range of the items listed previously.  In Defining Visual Images, the authors, Charles Hill and Marguerite Helmers,  explain that visual rhetoric is “understanding how images… work upon readers” (Helmers 2).  So visual rhetoric is the study of what impression visuals give a viewer.  There are many categories to look at when determining this impression or impact.
  
	One aspect of visual rhetoric is intertextuality.  This is how one image relates to another image.  Are there similarities?  Is it a certain type of image, advertisement, family photo?  This is important because the more images that are similar, the more symbols our society comes to know, and the study of semiotics is born.  The reason that images can mean something or create emotion in viewers is because of semiotics.  Objects in images represent concepts known to our culture, that have a common meaning throughout our society.  One example is the American flag.  The American flag in an image at least in America, stands for freedom.
  
	Psychology must also be looked at when studying images.  Trying to figure out what impact certain colors, shapes, symbols have on people is important in figuring out their reactions.  This psychology could change from culture to culture.  Cultural studies are then also important.  Two people from different backgrounds could see images in completely opposite views.  Read more about this [[../Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric|Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric]].
  
	Visual rhetoric found its beginnings in art criticism.  Analysts would look at aspects in the design and symbolism in a piece of fine art, to try and explain what the artist was trying to say.  One example of this is Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh.  To some people it is just a pretty painting to look at, while others see a foreshadowing to his death.  He includes a cypress tree, which is a cemetery tree.  He also has the stars, in Van Gogh’s time, heaven was being in the stars.  Now that painting would be looked at by a rhetorician and be analyzed in the same way- by looking at all aspects of it.  

	Visual rhetoric is highly connected to design.  When the maker of an image is creating it, he looks at the lines.  What direction are the lines going?  Are they thick or thin?  Are they diagonal?  In The Grammar of Visual Design, Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen write about vectors.  [[Rhetorical Vectors]].  Vectors are diagonal lines throughout an image.  Vectors create action in an image.  They determine whether or not an image is narrative or conceptual.  Another ‘grammatical’ concept in their book is modality.  Modality is how believable or realistic an image is- [[../Modality and Visual Representations of Reality|Modality and Visual Representations of Reality]].  Another ‘gramatical’ concept in their book is framing and salience.  Kress and Leeuwen say that the rhetoric of an image is affected by the framing around it- the way the image is cropped.  This makes the image either more or less believable.  
All of these concepts need to be analyzed in order to determine the rhetoric of an image.  And even through looking at each aspect scholars may disagree about the meaning.  Each person has previous knowledge and experiences that lead him or her to have his or her own opinion about different symbols.  But through semiotics and using ‘grammatical’ concepts, hopefully the study of visual rhetoric can become more stabilized and well thought of in intellectual circles- [[../Status of Visual Rhetoric and Visual Literacy in the Academy|Status of Visual Rhetoric and Visual Literacy in the Academy]].

A simple hack I made to get around the limitation on the number of mice. It gets around the problem by ignoring that there are multiple mice.

This is useful if you have a trackpad on a laptop and need to use an external mouse. 

&lt;pre&gt;
function [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse_AllowMultipleHack(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)
% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section of the [[Beekeeping| beekeeping wikibook]] exists as a place to quickly answer some frequently (and perhaps some non frequently) asked questions. Answers will generally be brief and possibly point in the direction of a pre-existing module on the subject. Any items that go into particular depth and don’t have a related module may eventually become a new module. Because of the ease and simplicity involved in answering (most) quick questions, there may, and likely will, exist information within this module that is not present in other modules.

Please keep in mind that most questions have a wide range of possibly correct answers. An old saying goes “if you ask 100 beekeepers the same question you will get 101 different answers.” Though some beepers may disagree with that statement, which does not change the fact that there will be different opinions as to the correct answer to a question. Because of this, hopefully more than one answer may be supplied for each question. If you choose to answer any questions, please do not simply remove answers you disagree with, rather add reasons to support your decision and let the reader gather information as they please.

If you have a particular question that has not been answered within the overall beekeeping wikibook, or have a question for this list which you wish to know the answer too please submit it to the [[Talk:Beekeeping/Frequently Asked Questions| frequently asked questions discussion page]].

==Getting Started==
;How much does it cost to get started beekeeping?
:This depends completely on the new beekeeper, equipment can be build, and items purchased new or used. Depending on how many hives are desired, access to bees and so forth. A complete hobbyist beginner may spend any where from $0 to $1000.

;How much time does it take to keep bees?
:Beekeeping is a seasonal task. During the winter there is little to be done, during the spring your time may be completely occupied. Once a beekeeper becomes accustomed to keeping bees it may take any where between five to thirty minutes per hive per week during the active season. However, this is not to say that beekeeping can’t consume more time if desired. 

;Is a license or permit required to keep bees?
:This is wholly dependent on where you live and possibly the number of hives you wish to keep. If you call your local agricultural department they can likely point you in the right direction.

;Do I need to join a local association or club to keep bees?
:Joining a club or association will likely never be a requirement, though doing so is greatly advised. Some clubs require yearly dues, but often this money is quickly more than paid back through the resources that the club provides.

==Bee Stings==
;How often do beekeepers get stung?
:This is dependent on many factors, including the [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| race]] of bees the keeper keeps, the temperament of the individual colonies, the number of colonies and the beekeepers attitude and skill. Every beekeeper that does his or her job properly will get stung at some point, it is rarely the goal, but sometimes the result. A beekeeper may expect more stings as they begin keeping bees, and fewer as they continue.

;Does being stung hurt?
:It can, and likely won't depending on where the sting occurred. The best protection against being stung is not to bother the bees, however the second best is to wear the proper protective gear such as a [[Beekeeping/Veil| veil]] or [[Beekeeping/Bee Suit| bee suit]]. Some beekeepers even purposely get stung around ten times a season to build and keep a tolerance to bee venom, causing intermediate stings to hurt and swell less.
;How many people in the US die as a result of bee stings?
:Statistics show that lightning is more likely to lead to death than bee stings.

;I was stung by a bee, how should I remove the stinger?
:The stinger should be removed as soon as possible by scraping it out, such as by using a finger nail or credit card. Squeezing the stinger, and attached venom pouch, may cause the release of more venom in to the skin.
;Do bees really die after stinging a person?
:Yes, if the bee that stings is a [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker bee]] it will lose its life shortly after stinging. A [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee]] may survive after stinging, however it is extremely unlikely to be stung by a queen.

;I was stung by a bee and received some redness and swelling in the immediate area, was this an allergic reaction?
:No, this may be a standard reaction to a bee sting, however consult a doctor to be sure.

==Hive Population==
;How many bees live within a colony?
:There may be any where between 10,000 to 80,000 bees in a colony. Population is highly dependant on the activity and season of the bees. 

;How many queen bees exist in a hive?
:Normally there only exist a single mated queen bee within a hive, though it is not unheard of to have two, but it is even rarer to have three.

==Bee Flight==
;How fast can bees fly?
:Bees can fly between six and nine miles per hour.

;How far do bees fly in a life time?
:[[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| Worker bees]] may fly up to 500 miles during their foraging existence which may last on average between 5 and 30 days.

;What is the radius bees will fly from their home site in order to forage?
:Bees will only fly as far as they need to, but may fly as far as 5 to 10 miles from home.

==Foraging==
===Nectar Collecting===
;What percentage of foraging bees collect nectar?
:Around 50 to 80 percent

;How many trips will a single bee make a day to forage for nectar?
:As many as 30 trips for a single bee have been recorded

;How much nectar can a bee collect during a single trip?
:A full load of nectar may weigh about 85% of the body weight of a bee.

===Pollen Collecting===
;What percentage of foraging bees collect pollen?
:Around 15 to 30 percent

;How many trips will a single bee make a day to forage pollen?
:As many as 50 trips for a single bee have been recorded

;How much pollen can a bee collect during a single trip?
:Rarely more than 15 mg

==Castes==
===Queen Bee===
;Does the queen sting and lay eggs with the same body part? &lt;small&gt;(Submitted by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 25 Apr 2005)&lt;/small&gt;
:Yes, other than its use to deposit eggs in the center of an empty cell, the [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee's]] stinger secondary function is inject other competitive queens with venom in order to eliminate them. The bee’s stinger is a modified ovipositor, which developed in to a defensive mechanism.

==Eliminating Bees==
;How can neighbors be prevented from keeping bees? &lt;small&gt;(Submitted by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 25 Apr 2005) &lt;/small&gt;
:In most areas there is no legal way to prevent a neighbor by force from keeping bees on their own property. If a law does not already exist preventing beekeeping in your community, you may wish to speak to a local government representative in order to instate one. However, there is often no good legal reason to instate such a law and beekeepers associations tend to fight as a group preventing any such law from being created. Checking zoning laws may be a secondary option, but most allow beekeeping as long as the hive population is below a certain level, which is often in the hundreds. The best option is to speak to your neighbor and explain your grievances in order to work out compromise, though be aware that in most cases they have no legal requirement to make you happy.

==Hive Products==
===Honey===
;Isn't it somewhat unsafe to eat honey produced in residential areas? It could be contaminated with [[w:Rhododendron|rhododendron]] or azalea nectar, and thus poisonous. &lt;small&gt;(Submitted by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 3 May 2005)&lt;/small&gt;
:While it is true that bees can forage nectar from plants with [[Beekeeping: Bad Bee Plants| human toxic nectar]], you have to consider the distribution of such flowers. If poison-nectar plants are the predominant source of nectar for forming honey, don’t eat the honey produced. However, in most cases such nectar sources are few and far between on the foraging path of honeybees. This in combination with the sheer amount of nectar that must be gathered to make a small amount of honey makes the occurrence of honey poisoning extremely rare. Experienced beekeepers should be aware of possible toxic honey their hive may produce, this honey is often collected and used only for feeding back to the bees. If there is any question, avoid using any honey that you don’t trust.

;Is it a good idea to feed infants or people with immune deficiencies honey?
: No, honey should not be fed to infants under the age of 1 or to people with severe immune system deficiencies. This is due to possibility of botulism spores being present within the honey. This level of botulism present should have no ill effect on a healthy person.

#How can I keep bees away from the flowers and water in my yard? -[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:58, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:: I personally am unaware of any sort of bee repellant, but I will see what I can find out. My best advise is not to plant flowers that are attractive to bees. There is not much you can do in regard to water, other than not letting it stand uncovered. If the simple presence of bees worries you, keep in mind that lightning kills more people than bees do. Once I get around to it, and assuming some one else dose not first, I will write and post an article addressing the issues of the (lack of) danger that bees pose. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 02:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
::: Well, that would be wrong. Bee stings can lead to infection. I had to get antibiotics and a tetanus vaccination the last time I was stung. My toe swelled up terribly, over a few days following the sting. Probably I would be dead if I hadn't gotten some modern antibiotics. Had I died, I'm pretty sure the bacteria would have gotten credit for my death, thus underestimating the danger of bees. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
::::I more specifically, should have said that bee venom as the direct causes deaths less likely than lightning. As true with any wound, infection is possible and secondary effects may occur, which should be treated if necessary. The wound created by a bee sting should be treated as any other wound. In cases where allergies do not exist, it takes about ten stings per pound of body weight to administer a lethal dose of venom. More statistics relating to insect sting deaths can be found [http://bee-quick.com/StingDeath.html here] or from the [http://www.nationmaster.com/cat/Mortality World Help Organization]. If allergies are a problem, you should, as I advise everyone with that problem, carry an epinephrine pen. Remember that Epinephrine only treats a symptom and reduces the profusion to your tissues thus reduces swelling and allows your airway to re-open, it does nothing to stop the underlying problem. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 03:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)

==Answer Discussion==
*How is a bee supposed to hold 0.5 mL of necter? That's 1/2 cc. A bee is about 1/4 cc total. They don't bring buckets with them. A hummingbird might, just barely, be able to hold this much. from [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] on 20:45, 25 Apr 2005)&lt;br&gt;
:A full load of nectar may weigh about be about 85% of the body weight of a bee. This may seem like a lot, but bees are more than adequate to complete the task. Keep in mind that an adult bee can easily carry away hive debris many times her size and weight. The only thing that limits the amount of nectar that can be brought back is the size of the bees honey stomach. According to my source, which I now see is wrong, claims that .5 mL is about the size of a drop from an eyedropper. I did not initially see the error as I don't normally use SI, I removed that segment of the answer and hope someone has a better one. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 21:42, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)
*Is it better to leave a bee stinger in until a proper tool can be found, or to just crudely squeeze at the stinger immediately? -[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:58, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:See the answer to the question “I was stung by a bee, how should I remove the stinger?” under the [[Beekeeping: Frequently Asked Questions#Bee Stings| bee stings]] category. The short and sweet answer is use a finger nail to scratch it out and avoid squeezing the stinger if possible. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 02:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
::Well yes, but the problem is that I don't carry a proper tool with me. My fingernails are often very short. So, do I search for a proper tool or just squeeze the stinger with blunt fingers? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
:::I too keep my nails rather short, in fact I just clipped them last night. As luck would have it, I was stung this afternoon during an inspection. (I nor any of my family has been stung unless we were directly distressing a bee, in this case I had the hive open and was not paying attention and crushed a bee) The stinger came right out with a flick of the finger. If you don’t have the proper tool, such as a credit card, a knife or even a pen or a business card, you can pinch the stinger between your fingers and remove it. However, doing this you are quite likely to cause more venom to be introduced to the wound. Time is also an issue, as the stinger will both pump more venom, and work its way deeper into the skin if given the chance. Depending on how quickly you can get access to the proper tool may depend on your choice of removal. Also remember that bees leave behind a chemical scent marker when they sting, possibly encouraging more bees to sting the general area, so leave the area, and mask the scent if possible. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 03:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Why, in a world where everyone is so determined to be different, do vectors offer a bridge across the active and intentional need to see objects in uniquely different ways?'' But most importantly: what is the bridge? Vectors are “forces generated by the shapes and configurations of visual objects. A vector is characterized by its magnitude, direction, and base of attack. Visual vectors are seen as oriented in both directions unless a special base determines the origin of the vector’s attack and thereby its direction&quot; (Arnheim 218). Without vectors, the commonality that brings critics and casual observers, alike, together to agree on the aesthetic value of an image would not exist.

Let us first look at what it is that vectors do. Vectors are used to &quot;visually realize different ways in which objects and their relations can be represented&quot; (Kress and van Leeuwen 56). Vectors act as visual cues to the observer of an image that perform like road signs to connect two separate objects that give the viewer direction as to where to look and what to look at next in a temporal capacity, or artifact. The importance lays in the connection that is conveyed by the use of a vector or vectors because they not only act as visual cues in paintings, but are found in everyday images and scenes. We experience and interpret vectors in our everyday lives whether through photos, diagrams,  architecture, or advertisements. Vectors tell us visually what we would normally say verbally.

== Vector usage ==
Vectors are connectors that we use in order to tell or interpret a story. When used in a narrative or narrative process, vectors act as a set of visual symbols or characteristics brought together in order to persuade or draw attention to certain aspects of a piece. Narrative representation or process is one way to determine why it is that vectors are rhetorical. When one thinks of a painting that is highly influential, almost immediately he or she is drawn to a certain point in the image that is of interest. This main focus in direction must be present for rhetorical vectors, and essentially images, to effectively communicate with the viewer. Direction is established by a given object in the image or simply by a layout of the action. There are many different elements that go into making a vector and therefore may be “formed by bodies or limbs or tools ‘in action’, but there are many other ways to turn represented elements into diagonal lines of action. A road running diagonally across the picture space, for instance, is also a vector and the car driving on it an ‘Actor’ in the process of ‘driving’. In abstract images such as diagrams, narrative processes are realized by graphic elements…” (Kress and van Leeuwen 59) Kress and Van Leeuwen discuss the concept of ‘Actor’ and ‘Goal’ as an important aspect in the narrative interpretation process. Vectors must initiate from single or multiple sources, often this main source is the ‘Actor’ in which the direction of an image originates. The ‘Goal’ is what the vector is drawing attention to, or the intended outcome, whether it’s the viewer, another point in the image, or within upon itself.

== Vector Relationships ==
Vectors also help us realize different types of relationships that are represented in images. These three relationships are:

*'''Unidirectional transactional action'''
*'''Bidirectional transactional action''' 
*'''Non-transactional action'''

In the first, Unidirectional transactional action, a vector is formed that connects an 'Actor' and a 'Goal'. This vector is normally moving from the body of the 'Actor' and is directed toward the 'Goal'. For instance, if a human being were pointing at an orange in a picture, a vector would be coming from the pointing hand a the orange, showing us that our focus should move from the hand toward the orange. In the second relationship, Bidirectional transactional action, a vector is shot between two subjects that are connected. For instance, if two humans are looking at each other, a double-headed vector would be moving between the two of them pointing at each other. A relationship is being formed between the two with the aid of the vector which is linking them. In the final relationship type, a Non-transactional action, a vector emanates from an 'Actor', but does not point at another participant. For instance, this could be a human being looking off into the distance to something outside of the image. We cannot assume the subject, or 'Actor', is looking at anything, so the vector emanating from his person is not linked to another participant, making the relationship formed by the vector non-transactional. (Kress and van Leeuwen 74)

== How are vectors used? ==
There are two ways in which vectors can be used whether in the form of direct address or drawing attention to an &quot;imagined act&quot; (Kress and van Leeuwen 117). More often we interpret vectors as a form of direct address rather than constituting an imagined act because vectors in the form of a direct address draw our attention and are more apparent, oftentimes, to viewers than searching for meaning in an image by themselves. For example, older military recruitment posters feature [[Image:479px-Unclesamwantyou.jpg|thumb|Vectors eminate from Uncle Sam's eyes and hand toward the viewer.]]a strong, determined, and influential-looking individual that points directly at the audience as if to give the impression that it is viewer that should become part of the values advertised in the poster. This type of direct address forces the viewer to become interactive with the image. Immediately after viewing the image, there is a certain relationship established between the 'Actor' in the image and the audience ,especially in the military advertisement, because the vector is directed at the viewer at an eye level, forcing the audience to acknowledge their relationship.

== Vectors in everyday life ==
Vectors are not only limited to two-dimensional images; they are around us in everyday life.  Buildings or sculptures may use vectors to draw one's eyes to a specific location.  Many other three-dimensional objects or even humans use vectors on a daily basis as a form of non-verbal communication.  For instance, try this experiment.  Go stand in a busy area and just look up in a direction towards nothing particular.  Passersby will look toward where your eyes are pointing.  This is because your focus on nothing at all is shooting a vector from your eyes in a specific direction. Vectors will prompt others to look that way as well. Vectors help to facilitate logical progression of an image, creating a relationship between the 'Actor' and 'Goal' in order to portray messages and connections to an audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In recent years there has been a shift in the academic field of rhetoric to include not only studies of rhetoric as they pertain to the written and spoken word, but also as they relate to images.  However, while most scholars agree on the validity of visual rhetoric and find it deserving of academic study, the attention given visuals’ rhetorical purpose is still very contested in academia; due to its novelty, it has not yet been determined how to study or explain visual rhetoric.    

The problems that visual rhetoric has encountered in obtaining a place in higher education have surprisingly little to do with visual rhetoric’s validity as an academic subject.  Rather, a main reason that visual rhetoric has faced some difficulty in being accepted widely as a legitimate academic discipline is the fact that not many people know what “visual rhetoric” encompasses.  This is not to say that people have no idea what visual rhetoric is - in fact the opposite is the case.  Visual rhetoric lends itself to so many [[../Definitions of Visual Rhetoric|Definitions of Visual Rhetoric]] that there is quite a bit of confusion concerning where to draw the line between what should be studied as visual rhetoric and what should not be.  Indeed, the very scholars who extol the legitimacy of visual rhetoric as a discipline and lobby for its rightful place in academia, often do not share a definition of “visual rhetoric.”  

The meaning of both parts of the two-word term “visual rhetoric” is debatable, and this has caused a great deal of confusion as to what actually falls under the umbrella of visual rhetoric.  For example, more than twenty scholarly definitions of the word “rhetoric” can be found at the [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricdefinitions.htm American Rhetoric website].  Although a common trend of “persuading/informing” seems to run through most of the definitions of rhetoric, it is easy to see that visual rhetoric is thought of very differently from one person to the next.

The same can be said of the word visual.  What types of “visuals” should be studied as worthwhile examples of visual rhetoric?  Popular subjects include: charts and graphs, internet visuals, paintings, traditional two-dimensional images, television, etc. See [[../Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric|Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric]]. Debates over which of these outlets are the most capable of being studied in a scholarly fashion as rhetoric are disputed.  From the perspective of many scholars, it seems far-reaching and a bit naive to say that all images are rhetorical and as such deserve to be studied.  Yet others claim that all visuals possess rhetoric and deserve attention.  

Correspondingly, there is no unanimously agreed upon method by which visual rhetoric should be incorporated into academia.  Hypothetically suppose that an agreed upon definition of visual rhetoric has been established and the problem of what should be studied no longer is an issue.  There then arises a dilemma concerning how to relate visual rhetoric studies to society, and how to interpret the power visual rhetoric possesses.  In other words, how should visual rhetoric be presented to students in an academic setting?  Should visual rhetoric be studied as a totally new and unique form of expression, or does it go hand-in-hand with traditional perspectives about verbal and written rhetoric?  There seems to be a division between those scholars who wish to study visual rhetoric through means similar to that of text-based rhetoric, and those who see the two as totally separate, believing that visual rhetoric is independent and deserves its own unique interpretation.  In the scholarly debate between these two options, the former seems to have become more of the norm.

Due in part to a lack of faith in images as deserving of scholastic study, visual arguments have in many cases been taught through methods similar to those of textual arguments.  Notes art historian Barbara Stafford concerning what she sees as a widespread attitude towards images: “In spite of their quantity and globalized presence, for many educated people pictures have become synonymous with ignorance, illiteracy, and deceit.” (Hill, 3).  If one inserted the words &quot;sculptures&quot; or &quot;monuments&quot; (See [[Visual Rhetoric/3D and 2D Visual Persuasion|3D and 2D Visual Persuasion]]) in place of the word “pictures” in Stafford’s claim, the result would be the same; in academia, words often bare more intellectual weight than visuals.  This reality, combined with the fact that many of the professors teaching visual rhetoric courses are actually trained in traditional writing and rhetoric disciplines as opposed to graphic design or art, has led many academics to align visual rhetoric with written rhetoric.  Scholars in many instances have even gone so far as to explain visual rhetoric in terms of the same grammatical rules as are used in written language.  This approach is in reality probably not a bad one, and most likely successfully serves the purposes of evaluating visual rhetoric.  However, if visual rhetoric is to gain a substantial foothold in academia, more attention needs to be given to how visuals act independently from language.

Overall, the emergence of visual rhetoric classes in upper education is constantly improving as they become more widespread and the dialogue of visusal rhetoric becomes more acceptable.  At this point in the infancy of academically studied visual rhetoric, the main objective of scholars should be to engage in purposful discussion about what visual rhetoric is and what it is not, all the while keeping in mind the goal of visual rhetoric’s emergence as a full-fledged academic discipline.

== Overview ==

Like most other bicycle bearings the headset needs periodic maintenance to keep it running smoothly.

There are two basic types of headset.

The style more common on older bikes is the threaded system, so called because the steerer tube of the fork is threaded. The top bearing race (cone) screws onto the fork steerer tube and is held in adjustment by a lock nut. The stem has an extension that extends down into the steerer tube and is held in place by a wedge.  

Most new bikes now use the threadless system. The fork steerer has no threads. Unlike the threaded system the steerer tube extends beyond the top of the headset. The stem clamps onto the steerer tube holding everything together.  The headset bearings are tensioned (adjusted) by an allen bolt that pulls up on a star nut inserted into the steerer tube.  This applies tension against the upper bearing race (the stem needs to be loosened when for this adjustment to be made).

Headsets also use several different bearings types including loose ball bearings, roller bearings and cartridge bearings.

== Threadless Headsets ==
[[Image:br_aheadset.png|right|thumb|Threadless headset cross section]]
[[Image:Bicycle headset (threadless) exploded view-en.png|right|thumb|an exploded view of a threadless headset]]

=== Tools required ===

=== Disassembly ===

* Remove the pre load adjustment bolt on the top of the steerer tube. Also remove the top cap and any spacers that are above the stem.

* Making sure the fork is supported loosen the bolts clamping the stem to the steerer tube. Now the stem is loose pull it off the steerer tube. Since the stem is holding everything together the fork is free to fall out the bottom of the head tube if not restrained.

* Occasionally the conical compression ring will have a tight grip on the steerer. A gentle tap on the steerer tube with a mallet or your palm will free it up. Some (sealed-bearing) headsets will have a rubber O-ring fitted into the compression ring (bearing cap). Have a replacement handy, or take care not to shear the O-ring.

* Remove the fork from the frame, take care to note the location and orientation of the individual pieces.

* Clean and inspect bearings and races.

=== Assembly ===

* Apply grease to both cups, crown race and bearings.

* Assemble the parts in reverse order that you removed them

* Slide the stem and spacers onto the steerer tube (but leave loose) and refit the top cap and bolt.

* The bearings are adjusted by tightening and loosening the top bolt. The bearings should be adjusted so there is no play. Clamp the front brake and rock the bike backwards and forwards to check.

* Now the bearings are correctly adjusted line up the stem and tighten the bolts.

== Threaded Headsets ==
[[Image:br_threadedheadset.png|right|thumb|Threaded headset cross section]]

=== Assembly and adjustment ===


Adjustment of the threaded headset bearings is similar to the technique used for all cup and cone bearings.  The stem is not a part of the headset and should be removed for all of this work.  Don't worry about applying too much grease, excess will be squeezed out.
* Clean all old grease and dirt off all balls, races, cones, etc.
* Apply fresh grease to crown race and place clean (preferably new) bearing balls on the crown race, applying more grease as needed.  Be careful not to drop any balls.  If the balls are in a cage, slide the cage down the steerer tube and place it on the race.
* Slide the fork into the steerer tube of the frame, again being careful not to drop any balls.
* Apply fresh grease to the top cup and place clean (preferably new) bearing balls on the top cup, applying more grease as needed.  Be careful not to drop any balls.  If the balls are in a cage, carefully place the cage in the top cup.
* Apply a thin layer of grease to the fork steerer tube threads (mainly to ease removal in the future).
* Screw the threaded race down the fork until it is tight enough to prevent any balls from falling out, but still leaving some play, to be adjusted later.
* Slide down any washers on top of the threaded race.  The washers are often keyed to fit in a notch in the steerer tube of the fork.
* Screw the headset locknut down the steerer tube and loosely against the threaded race (and washers).
* Finger tighten the threaded race down so that the fork turns easily but has no side-to-side play.  If it is too loose, it will be possible to wobble the fork side-to-side.  If the bearings are in poor condition, some compromise might be required, where the movement is slightly difficult in some positions and slightly wobbly in others.
* Holding the threaded race with one hand, finger tighten the locknut against the threaded race.
* Use two headset wrenches (or one headset wrench and one large adjustable wrench), tighten the locknut against the threaded race, without moving the threaded race.  
* After the locknut has been tightened, the movement of the fork should still be smooth and without wobble.  Loosen the locknut and repeat the previous step until this is achieved.  If this can't be achieved, possible causes are: worn bearing balls, worn rolling surfaces, incorrect number of balls, bent fork steerer tube.
*Wipe off excess grease and admire the results of your efforts.

[[Image:Saucepan.jpg|thumb|right|A saucepan]]
A '''saucepan''' is a cooking vessel generally used on top of a range for heating food and / or reducing sauces.

Saucepans can be made of a variety of materials, like aluminium and stainless steel, and the cooking surface can have a non-stick coating, like Teflon. As with all pans the heavier the gauge of the metal the better (especially at the base); it enables more even heat distribution, which makes sticking and burning less likely. Some saucepans have a thick sheet of thermally conductive aluminium laminated into their base for that purpose (like the one shown). A coating of copper on the base allegedly has the same effect, but it would need to be reasonably thick to have any real benefit.

High-sided sauce pans are most useful for heating foods with high liquid content. Low-sided and flare-sided (called Windsor pans) saucepans are most effective for reducing sauces and other liquids.</text>

A '''stock pot''' is a very large and deep cooking vessel generally used on top of a range for making stock or soup.

Stock pots can be made of a variety of materials, like aluminium and stainless steel, As with all pans the heavier the gauge of the metal the better (especially at the base); it enables more even heat distribution, which makes sticking and burning less likely. Some stock pots have a thick sheet of thermally conductive aluminium laminated into their base for that purpose (like the one shown). A coating of copper on the base allegedly has the same effect, but it would need to be reasonably thick to have any real benefit.  They can also contain copper, and carbon steel. Pasta is an example of food that could be cooked in these pots.</text>

[[Image:Paring Knife.jpg|thumb|right|A paring knife]]

#A '''paring knife''' is a small knife than the chef's knife and mostly used for shaping and trimming food. It is a most useful  knife for small &amp; intricate work like removing Jalapeño seeds, de-veining shrimp, skinning vegetables, coring an apple and mincing vegetables.
#'Sheep's foot paring knife' and 'Birds Beak paring knife' are widely used types of paring knives.

It is important that any knives are kept sharp, as blunt knives require more force to use, actually increasing the likelihood of injury (cuts from a sharp knife heal more quickly than those from a blunt one). A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|knife sharpener]] can be used to sharpen knives.</text>

[[Image:Sharpening Steel.jpg|thumb|right|A steel]]

There are various kinds of '''knife sharpeners''' available for maintaining the sharpness of knives.

A '''sharpening stone''' or '''oil stone''' is also known simply as a '''stone''', and is a tool for maintaining the sharpness of knives. It consists of a carborundum stone, a block of ceramic, or a metal plate with embedded diamond dust. There are generally three 'grades' of stones: a coarse stone for rapid renewal of a badly damaged blade, a medium stone for general work and a fine or Arkansas stone to put the final edge to the blade.  Many of these require the addition of an appropriate lubricant, such as oil or water, to carry away the &quot;cuttings&quot; from the edge while sharpening.  The lubricant prevents the pores in the stone from becoming clogged up with the metal and grit created by the process.

For maintaining the edge on a knife, and not for intensive sharpening, the '''honing steel''', also known simply as a '''steel''', is the choice of professional chefs.  These do not actually sharpen knives, unless they have fine diamond grains on them, but they are often mislabeled as &quot;sharpening steels&quot;.

The steel was originally used to straighten the sharpened edge of a blade where use had pushed it to one side or another on a microscopic scale.  This is preferred, as the metal is brought back to its sharper state quickly, often a matter of four or five strokes of the steel, by restoring the existing edge rather than stone-cutting a new one.  

A steel usually consists of a hardened steel rod with many tiny grooves scored lengthwise. Seemingly paradoxically, they can also be made from a ceramic material specifically intended for sharpening hardened knives, as a standard steel can quickly become blunted. Another version is the diamond steel, with tiny specks of industrial diamond dust bonded to its surface. These are very effective for both sharpening and honing the edges of knives, but they tend to wear away at the knife far more quickly than do other kinds of steel. 

To use a steel, the knife is drawn across roughly perpendicular to it, somewhat like a slow slashing motion, that both takes the knife across the steel while moving down the steel's length, alternating sides of the knife with each pass.  Home cooking enthusiasts will find that a inexpensive (US$20) steel will bring many knives back to life in moments.  

Holding the knife at the appropriate angle, about 15-25 degrees, to match the existing stone-cut angle, the first moves of the knife will feel kind of rough and resistant to the steel.  The feel will diminish within five or ten strokes, even holding the same angle and pressure.  That is the steel telling you the job is done.  A good steel will extend the life between stone sharpening by many months in most cases.

[[Image:Egg Slicer.jpg|thumb|right|An egg slicer]]

An '''egg slicer''' is a food preparation utensil used to slice peeled, hard-boiled eggs quickly and evenly. It consists of a slotted dish for holding the egg and a hinged plate of wires or blades that can be closed to slice.

Though primarily used for eggs, an egg slicer can also be used to uniformly slice soft fruits and vegetables like mushrooms or strawberries.

[[Image:Potato Masher.jpg|thumb|right|A potato masher]]

A '''potato masher''' is a food preparation utensil used to crush cooked food. Its name comes from its most common use: crushing cooked potatoes for mashed potatoes.

The potato masher consists of a handle connected to a mashing head. The handle can either be upright or sideways. There are two types of heads. The first is a large gauge wire in a rounded zig-zag shape. The second is a plate with holes or slits (as shown). The potato or other food is mashed by grabbing the handle and pushing down on the foodstuff.

'''Chopsticks''' are a pair of small even-length tapered sticks that are used to grasp food and convey it to the mouth. Chopsticks are commonly made of wood, bamboo, metal, bone, ivory, and in modern times, plastic as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Emulation, is quite simply the translation of software written for a different subset of hardware or for a different operating system into software which will run on the current platform.  To put it quite simply its any computer program that mimics the behavior of any other piece of computer hardware, such as an older computer or video game console.
Why would one want to do this? Here are some reasons:

# '''Maintaining Investment in Older Software''' - Software isn't cheap these days, yet most of us have investments in older software that is still perfectly functional, except for incompatibilities with newer hardware and operating systems. Why throw it away?
# '''Experimentation''' - Oftentimes when writing drivers for a piece of hardware or when writing software to run on a microprocessor one often wants to make sure they have a working piece of software before writing it onto the hardware.  Sometimes the hardware you're writing the software for may not even exist yet.  In either case emulation software is invaluable as it allows you to debug errors in your program without risking the hardware device, emulators can also provide more detailed information on errors that occur, thus they are ideal for testing software without risking the hardware.
# '''Nostalgia''' - Let's face it. We all have old games or operating systems that we know and love. Perhaps it is no longer practical to use them full time, but it's always pleasant to play around with them once in a while.

[[Image:Wire Rack.jpg|thumb|right|cooling rack]]

A '''cooling rack''' (also known simply as a '''wire rack''') is used to allow air to circulate freely to cool [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods, and to prevent them getting soggy from condensation.

A tight grid is typically the best format for a cooling rack, to prevent thin baked goods from breaking or falling through.

An alternative is often to flip the baked goods upside down and leave them in the original hot pan.</text>

[[Image:Mixing Bowl.jpg|thumb|right|mixing bowl]]

A '''mixing bowl''' is a deep bowl that is particularly well suited for mixing ingredients together in.

These come in many materials, such as stainless steel, ceramic, glass, and plastic.  If using a handheld [[Cookbook:Electric mixer|electric mixer]] rather than a standing mixer, be sure to get mixing bowls that will be usable with such a mixer, and which have high enough sides to prevent splatter from it.

Typically one should have at least three mixing bowls of different sizes, as it is often necessary when baking to keep mixtures of ingredients separate.  Also, prepared dough can be stored in the refrigerator directly in the mixing bowl, so consider bowls which can handle temperature change well and/or which have lids for such storage (if your bowls do not have lids, plastic wrap or aluminum foil may be used to cover them).</text>

[[Image:Sifter.jpg|thumb|right|A sifter]]

A '''sifter''' is a device used to simultaneously sieve and aerate flour and other dry ingredients used in baking. It should be noted that a simple [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]] can be employed for the same task, with the same result. It is sometimes refered to as a &quot;tami&quot; (French).</text>

[[Image:CookbookPizzaPan.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pizza Pan]]

A '''pizza pan''' is used to [[Cookbook:Baking|bake]] [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]]. It is usually an aluminum disk, about 18[[Cookbook:Inch|&quot;]] (450 mm) in diameter, with lots of small holes to let moisture out for a crispy crust. Sometimes a mesh of steel wire is used.

With completely uncooked pizza [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]], a [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] can be substituted. (this alone will not produce a crispy crust) With a partially cooked crust, the pizza can be placed on an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] rack without any pan at all.

An aluminum pizza pan should not be cleaned with caustic oven cleaner, as the resulting chemical reaction will damage it.</text>

[[Image:Kookplaat.jpg|thumb|right|cooktop]]
A '''cooktop''', also known as a '''range''' or '''stovetop''', is an [[Cookbook:Appliances|appliance]] used for heating [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pots and pans]]. Most cooktops are attached to the top of an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]].

Cooktops vary in their methods of heat generation, with some models providing multiple options. The various methods include:

==Gas==
Gas is traditional and well-loved by many expert cooks. Gas responds quickly to adjustments and generally provides high heat output. Gas works with any pan, including the round-bottomed [[Cookbook:Wok|woks]] that are best for [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-frying]]. The flame can be useful for cooking a [[Cookbook:Marshmallow|marshmallow]] or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] on a fork. Gas cooktops are often very durable. Gas cooktops often come with gas ovens, which are not good for producing crunchy and crispy foods.

==Electric Coil==
Electric coil cooktops are cheap, common, but don't allow the heat output to be adjusted quickly.

==Induction==
Induction is the most energy efficient cooktop method which uses magnetic induction energy to produce heat, rather than directly applying heat energy. Induction allows instantaneous heating, which reduces cooking time and reduces room temperatures when compared to other conventional methods. The induction surface is cooler and safer than ceramic cooktops. Induction cooktops have a smooth flat surface that is easy to clean. 

Unfortunately, they require flat-bottomed magnetic pots and pans. Aluminum and copper will not work. Stainless steel may work poorly. Cast iron and carbon steel work well. 

Induction cooktops now have a significant electronic component integrated in its control and operation. Safety mechanisms such as pan detection, spill detection, temperature sensor - 'safety cutoff' and residual heat indicators (to indicate a surface is hot) are quickly becoming standard features.

Other features include; electronic touch controls, child safety lock, unsuitable pan detection, preset temperature routines and programs, and power consumption optimization.

Predominant manufacturers include: Kleenmaid, St George, and Whirlpool.

==Ceramic==
Ceramic cooktops act like electric coil cooktops, but they are easy to clean. They are also fragile and expensive.</text>

      <comment>/* Habit 3: First things first */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The first three habits, 1. '''be proactive''', 2. '''begin with and end in mind''', and 3. put the '''first thing first''', are grouped together in a category called '''private victory'''. Private victories are personal and relate to you as an individual person. In contrast, the [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Public victory|following three habits]] are grouped together as habits geared towards [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Public victory|public victory]], and are related to your social success and in working effectively with others.

== Habit 1: Be Proactive==
&quot;There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living&quot; – David Starr Jordan.

Being pro-active is the opposite of being re-active. Both are active, but the first is coming from an inner impulse inside yourself, powered by own desires, while the latter is reacting to outer circumstances. The worst case of being reactive is only acting on outer stimulus without any inner reflection, drive or initiative. To cultivate this initiative is achieved by taking full responsibility for your own life , by becoming response-able – able to choose your response to the world from the inside, before the world is showing you, that you have to act.
The space inside of us between stimulus and response is the space of our freedom to choose, to chose our response. It is what makes us human, and not stimulus-response animals. We are able to choose our reaction. &quot;Act or be acted upon&quot; is one headline that illustrates the point here.
The Circle of Concern and the Circle of Influence
The Circle of Concern are all areas in life that we are concerned with, that we have &quot;on our radar&quot;, may it be our health, our children, the national dept or global warming. The Circle of Influence are those areas inside the circle of concern, that you actually can do something about now. My favorite example is the bad news on TV. Usually you can do absolutely nothing about it and you won’t do anything except saying &quot;Oh look how bad this is&quot;. Why should you pollute your mind with it and distract your focus to something you are helpless with? Can you see how futile and self-defeating this is?
  
If you are proactive you focus only on your Circle of Influence, where you actually can influence the situation. By doing so, you not only enable yourself to do something of value you also increase your Circle of Influence. If an event on the corner of your Circle of Influence is happening, you have the choice to act on it mastering the situation and so increasing your Influence, or you can move backwards which will decrease your Influence. An example would be if you lose your driving license because you can choose to do the tests again to regain it or you can choose to retreat from driving and then lowering your mobility, thus decreasing your Circle of Influence.

== Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind ==

&quot;What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us&quot; – Oliver Wendell Holmes.

This habit is based on the principle of Personal Leadership, which means you decide what you want , you lead yourself in the direction you choose. There are always two creations of everything that we do. The first of the creations is mental, in our heads and not yet materialized. This is what the second habit is about. The second creation is in the material world. This is what the third habit is about.
Beginning with the end in mind says that we need to develop a vision, a clear picture of what we choose to be and create in our lifetime. Stephen illustrates this succinctly by suggesting that you write your own funeral speech! What kind of person have you been, what did you stand for, what did you create? What were your contributions to the people you love and what difference have you made in their lives?
This is a fantastic visualization exercise that connects us deeply with ourselves and it is the perfect illustration of Begin with the End in Mind. Having such a personal vision rooted in our own values acts like a guidance-system. That is what the habit does: if you think from the end, you become like Michelangelo in the great metaphor of sculpting the statue of David out of a blog of stone, where he simply cut off the pieces of stones that were still in the way of his vision to materialize.

== Habit 3: First things first ==

&quot;First Things First

&quot;Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least&quot; – Wolfgang von Goethe.

The third habit is where you make your plan happen – where you develop an action-plan and execute it in the best way possible. While the second habit is the Leadership habit, this is the Management habit. And you do this in an effective way by setting priorities for the most important things first. Then you work on these first things until they are done. You exercise your discipline powered by your vision and goals where you know what you have to do to create this vision into reality. It is to really live your decisions, to walk your talk.
There are several tools here that can improve walking your talk. Setting the right priorities is one of the most important tasks. To set priorities, you first have to execute habit one and two of course, because otherwise – as Stephen also explains it – it happens to you that your ladder of success is leaning toward the wrong wall. If you have not taken full responsibility and clearly decided what you want in life, the priorities you set cannot have a deeper meaning to you. It just does not happen by accident. So choose proactively what you want first, then create an action-plan, set priorities and act on them.

Time Management

One of the most helpful things in execution is to effectively manage the time that we have available. Basically there are four areas where we spend our time. You can divide them into four quadrants by categorizing each task on a) Importance and b) Urgency:
 
A task is important or not important and it is urgent or not urgent:

1.	Quadrant of DEMAND – important and urgent
This is usually the core of a busy person, tasks that are important and also urgent, you just can not put them off and they have to be done now. It is important and should be well executed. 

2.	Quadrant of THE ZONE – important but not urgent
This is where you plan, improve, develop, build relationships and see opportunities. It is the basis for real success and the heart of leadership. 

3.	Quadrant of ILLUSION – not important but urgent
The quadrant of illusion is a serious problem in personal management because it deludes you into thinking that the tasks you do are important. However, they are only made urgent by demands from outside agents or by wrong judgments of yourself. In reality, they have no profound impact on your achievements at all. 

4.	Quadrant of ESCAPE – not important and not urgent
This is the area you need to avoid altogether if you are interested in success. It is the escape from what matters by distraction, because of fear, irresponsibility or fuzzy goals. 

What you need to do is move as much time as possible into The Zone (Quadrant II) and spend the rest of time in Quadrant I, the important and urgent demands. What you can do to raise awareness of your tasks is make a list of all tasks you do over the day or week. Then put all tasks honestly to the quadrant where you really spend your time doing them. Remember that it serves no purpose at all to be nice to yourself here, total honesty to yourself is always the most empowering thing you really can do. Then get rid of tasks in quadrant III and IV (not important) as soon as possible and move into Quadrant I and II. The best managers spend at least 50% of their time in Quadrant II and those are the most effective.

If you are really overwhelmed by Quadrant I and also III tasks (urgent), here is what you can do:
•	Do less: Say &quot;No&quot; more often, focus more on the most important tasks, your highest priorities, do less better! 
•	Delegate more: give tasks to people who can do it better, are more efficient, more qualified or more suitable for the task than you. 
•	Go into The Zone to create more resources for the urgent matters or lessen the urgency by better preparation and proactive planning. 

Please also take a look at my later article: A Beginners Guide to Time Management. 
These were the three habits for private victory as described by Stephen Covey. I think they are principles in fact. They are like natural laws for personal development and effectiveness. I’m looking forward to hearing your views and experiences with these three habits! What kind of successes or disappointments have you dealt with? Share them in the comments, I will also join in and answer questions of course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The second set of three habits, 4. '''think win-win''', 5. '''seek first to understand, then be understood''', and 6. '''synergize''', are the basis for '''public victory'''.

Public victory is success with others in teams and in relationships in general. They are shared victories where you help and are helped by other people.

Public victories are built on the [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Private victory|private victories]] of the [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Private victory|first three habits]]. To be publicly successful in a deep or real way, you should first build the first three habits into your character. To try to do things another way is building on a false foundation and will bring about only short-term results.

== Habit 4: Think win-win ==
Many of us grow up with a competitive mindset, &quot;I win, you lose&quot;. Or, a beaten-down mindset, &quot;I give up, do whatever you want to me&quot;. Or, a mix of these and other mindsets. Each of these has its place. However, for most of the most valuable interactions we have in family and business, the most mature and effective point of view is seeking situations that benefit everyone involved. 

When we negotiate, we should seek to make deals that help everyone. In cases where this is not possible, it is best to have the mindset from the outset that you will walk away from the deal.

== Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then be understood ==
To influence and help others, you must first actively listen to them and understand their situation and concerns. Think of the example of a doctor who gives a prescription over the telephone without getting all of the necessary information about the patient or his condition. This could lead to a serious or fatal error if the patient takes the wrong medicine. In the same way, you should be very careful when you start to give anyone advice that you understand the preoccupations and situation of that person. Even if your advice is very good, it will likely not apply to the situation.

Part of this is not just to listen passively but to listen actively and empathetically. Put yourself in the shoes of the other person. See the world from his perspective as best you can. Listen without judging.

Three main errors to avoid: 1. &quot;Hearing&quot; everything through a filter formed by your own world-view, imposing your pre-conceived ideas on everything that you hear. 2. 3.

All our life we have been frustrated when someone just won't understand. Someone who just argues for his position.  Understanding is the doorway to collaboration, friendship, and more. 
When seeking first to understand, honestly empathize with the person. Listen actively and then state their case back to them so they say &quot;yes that's exactly how I see it&quot;.  When that condition occurs, you may seek to be understood. The resulting exchange of ideas and feelings is bound to be synergistic, win-win.

The second set of three habits, 4. think win-win, 5. seek first to understand, then be understood, and 6. synergize, are the basis for public victory.

Public victory is success with others in teams and in relationships in general. They are shared victories where you help and are helped by other people.

Public victories are built on the private victories of the first three habits. To be publicly successful in a deep or real way, you should first build the first three habits into your character. To try to do things another way is building on a false foundation and will bring about only short-term results.

[edit] Habit 4: Think win-win

Many of us grow up with a competitive mindset, &quot;I win, you lose&quot;. Or, a beaten-down mindset, &quot;I give up, do whatever you want to me&quot;. Or, a mix of these and other mindsets. Each of these has its place. However, for most of the most valuable interactions we have in family and business, the most mature and effective point of view is seeking situations that benefit everyone involved.

When we negotiate, we should seek to make deals that help everyone. In cases where this is not possible, it is best to have the mindset from the outset that you will walk away from the deal.

[edit] Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then be understood

== Habit 6: Synergize ==
This habit deals with '''teamwork''' and opening yourself up emotionally to work with other people. It says that optimistic, emotionally-charged individuals who are living out the previous habits are able to work in amazing ways and come up with new alternatives together that no one of them would have come up with alone. The idea is that one plus one is three, or more, and the '''synergy''' happens when these &quot;third alternatives&quot; appear. It is a bit chaotic but fun and stimulating. Along with these there is a 3rd NOVEL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a world consumed with hatred, war, cheating, corruption, etc., one of the bible's greatest contributions to the world is the concept that God loves us.  The Bible give us wisdom about the meaning of love: the love of God for us and the love that we are called to share with others in order to make the world a better place.  Please consider these selections when thinking about love.


PSALM 139:7-8 offers us a glimpse of just how far God's love will go, even past the portal of death: &quot;Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?  If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths of [sheol], you are there.&quot;

The universality of God's love, as it originates in Abraham, has its roots in GENESIS 12:3 &quot;I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&quot;

The reach of God's love is found in PSALM 139:7-8 &quot;Where can I go from your spirit?  Or where can I flee from your presence?  If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in She'ol, you are there.&quot;

God's patience, expressed in love can be found in PSALM 145:8-10 &quot;The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.  The Lord is good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has made.  All your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord, and all your faithful shall bless you.&quot;

God's gift of love, to all, is expressed in JOEL 2:28 &quot;I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.&quot;

Jesus explains the love of God in a way that is a challenge to many North Americans, in MATTHEW 5:43-46, &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.  For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?&quot;

Jesus tells a short story about God's love in LUKE 15:4 &quot;Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?  When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.  And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'&quot;

Paul gives us a beautiful image of love in 1 CORINTHIANS 13:4-8 &quot;Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude.  It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">When using tutor applications, the computer or software possesses all of the information and controls the learning environment.  The computer presents the information to the students.  The students respond to the information or question and the computer analyzes the response and presents new information or more practice.  Tutor applications include drill and practice, tutorials and simulations.


'''Tutor Application Software'''

These types of software are designated as &quot;courses in a box&quot; and are found in many subject areas such as, math, music, software training, and even typing. Their application can be utilized in almost any category where learning is to be supplemented by a self study or self tutoring approach.
Entering the keywords tutoring software in any web browser will produce millions of sites that offer specific tutoring application software on almost any topic.

Now that we've created our simple person, it's time to give him somewhere to go.  In this tutorial we'll create a mountain range using a few simple, and handy tools.

==Creating a simple plane==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-SimplePlane.png|right]]
First we need a clean area to work with.
*Start off with a new project, using ''File &amp;rarr; New'', or hit '''CTRL+N KEY'''.  If you have a default cube or plane just delete them now (select them with '''RMB''' and press '''X KEY''').

Our first step is to create a large plane that we'll use for the ground and grow our mountains out of.
* Press on '''NUM7''' to enter top view.  This way our plane will be lying flat when we create it.
* Press '''SHIFT+C'''. This sets the 3D cursor to (0,0,0) which will be the center of the plane we will add.(or use - '''SHIFT+S''' -&gt; '''cursor to center''')
* Now add the plane with '''SHIFT+A''' &amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; Plane''.  This will be our canvas.
* Change to '''Edit mode''' ('''TAB''' changes between edit and object mode)
* Scale the plane up by about 15. First put the mouse close to the center of the plane and press '''SKEY''' and drag the cursor away and watch the numbers in the bottom left of the 3D Window. Hold '''CTRL''' to increment by 0.1 for a more precise measurement. Alternatively, to enter the exact amount yourself press '''SKEY''', then simply type '''15''' and hit '''ENTER'''.
* In the Tool Shelf at left, under ''Mesh Tools'' hit the ''Subdivide'' button 4 times. Alternatively, in the 3D View window you can press '''WKEY''' and select '''Subdivide'''.  You can also just hit '''ENTER''', because ''Subdivide'' is the first option under WKEY.

'''Note:''' As in many of the next tutorials, you may choose to add a grid instead of adding a plane and then subdividing it to have vertices throughout the plane. Adding a grid has the added advantage of allowing you to select the number of vertices along the x and y axes (the two edges) of the grid at the instant of creating the grid, so there is no need to make further subdivisions.

==First mountain== 

Now that we have the ground, it's time to start growing our mountains.
* Make sure you have nothing selected ('''AKEY''').
* Select a random vertex with '''RMB'''. I usually start at the one that is 4 down from the top and 4 in from the left (the 4th vertex if you count the edges).
* Change to the side view with '''NUM3'''.
[[Image:Blender-Noob-to-Pro Proportional Menu.png|right]]
* Press '''O''' to change to proportional edit mode or use the button which shows a grey ring on the header of the 3D View. The button will change its color to blue. You can also use '''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Transform&amp;rarr;Proportional Edit'' (By default this button is located just below the 3D view).
* Once you've turned proportional edit mode on, another button appears to its right, the falloff button. Select Smooth Falloff here. Alternatively you can use the menu on the header of the 3D View (''Mesh &amp;rarr; Proportional Falloff &amp;rarr; Smooth'') or, using '''SHIFT + OKEY''' will cycle through all 6 falloff types while using the Proportional editing tool.
* Press '''G''' to grab the vertex. We should now have a circle surrounding the vertex, this is our ''radius of influence''. Basically any vertices inside this circle will be affected by any changes to the vertex itself.

'''Noob Note:''' If you're having trouble seeing or changing the radius of influence, try saving your scene and restarting Blender.

* Use the '''Mouse Wheel''' or '''PAGE_UPKEY''' and '''PAGE_DOWNKEY''' to adjust the radius of influence to include just over 2 vertices on each side of our selected vertex. (Depending on your version of Blender, you may need to use '''ALT + NUM+/ PAGE_UPKEY''' and '''ALT + NUM-/ PAGE_DOWNKEY''' and may need to hold down the '''LMB''' while using the '''Mouse Wheel''' to adjust the radius of the influence.On Mac, hold the &quot;fnKey&quot; down and hit &quot;page-up&quot; or &quot;page-down&quot;). In 2.41 you must 'grab' the vertex first - only then can you alter the sphere of influence (in my version, 2.42a, the 3D cursor had to be snapped to the selection before the wheel appeared).

'''Noob Note:''' To change the radius on a Macbook press &quot;fn&quot;+ up/down. OSX uses function + arrow keys as replacements for &quot;home&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, &quot;page up&quot; and &quot;page down&quot; keys.

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-FirstMountain.png|right]]
* Move the vertex up about 8 units on the Z-Axis. Do this by dragging the cursor up a little, and press the '''MMB'''; this should restrain the movements along the Z-axis. Now use '''CTRL''' to move it precisely. Alternatively you can use '''ZKEY''' to restrain movements to the Z-Axis and type '''8''' and hit '''ENTER'''. In older versions of Blender you may need to hit the '''NKEY''' before typing the number 8.

Congratulations, we just created our first mountain. Now it's time to see what other things we can accomplish with the proportional editing tool.

==Peaks vs. hills==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Sharpfalloff.png|right]]
The 2.37 and onward releases offer at least 6 types and 2 modes of proportional editing. The previous release only has 2 of these types: Smooth and Sharp Falloff. We'll take a look at the difference between these two now.
* Change to top view again with '''NUM7'''. You'll notice that now your &quot;mountain&quot; looks like a few differently shaded squares in the grid; you're looking down on shaded tiles, but in the Z axis, they're all still perfectly aligned with the original grid.
* Select another vertex away from the first. Let's say 4 from the bottom 4 from the right (counting the vertices on the edges).
* Change back to the side view with '''NUM3'''
* Select Sharp Falloff from the menu on the bar of the 3D View. Alternatively, using '''SHIFT+OKEY''' will switch from one to the next of the 6 proportional editing modes while using the Proportional editing tool.
* As before, move the vertex up 8 units on the Z-Axis (''Note: The radius of influence will still be the same size as when we last used it'').
** '''GKEY'''
** '''ZKEY'''
** Type '''8''' and hit '''ENTER'''
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-SharpVsSmoothFalloff.png|right]]
Now we can see the differences between the sharp and smooth falloff. The same number of vertices are affected in both cases; only the degree to which they are affected is different.

The different proportional editing modes can be selected from the box immediately to the left of the proportional editing type box. The mode box contains three options: Off, On, and Connected. &quot;Off&quot; means that proportional editing will not be used. &quot;Connected&quot; means that only vertices linked to the selected vertices will be affected by the radius of influence. &quot;On&quot; means that all vertices will be affected.

==Shaping the world==

[[Image:Blender_proportional_smooth_before_rotation.jpg|300px|right]]
Now that we've created a couple of Mountains, it's time to see how we can use proportional editing to shape them.
* First make sure we're in side view ('''NUM3''').
* Then on the smooth falloff mountain, the first one we created, select the vertex that is immediately down and left from the topmost point.
* Press '''RKEY''' to rotate, scroll the '''MMB''' to change effective radius so it includes other points. Your screen should look like the photo to the right.
You can see the size of the proportional editing circle, and that there is only one vertex on the mountainside selected.

* Next hold '''CTRL''' and rotate everything by -90. Alternatively, use '''RKEY''', '''NKEY''', and type '''-90''' and press '''ENTER'''. Your mountain should now look like this:


'''Noob note:''' be careful about the range of affected vertices. If the range is too small, then rotating will affect just the selected vertex. If the range is too large, it will rotate everything together. You can adjust the range by using the scroll wheel on the mouse.

[[Image:Blender_proportional_smooth_after_rotation.jpg|300px|right]]
Notice that the vertex itself did not move; since it is at the center of the circle it had no effect.  The adjoining vertexes within the edit circle were rotated around it in decreasing amounts the further from the center they are.  Try doing it again with a larger proportional editing circle.
Feel free to play around with scaling or rotating from different view points (don't forget that you can also use '''GKEY''' to move vertices vertically or horizontally).


Try viewing your world from top view while rotating with a large effective radius.  You will see the nearby vertexes move close to the full amount while vertexes further away move less.

==Smoothing things out==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-RoundedMtns.png|right]]
Now that we have a couple of budding mountains, you probably think they look kind of choppy. Sure they would be good if we were making an 8-bit console game, but we're working with 3D here, we want things to look sharper (or maybe smoother) than that. There are a couple of approaches to this. The first is to use more vertices when we create our plane. And I won't lie, it works. But it's also a HUGE resource hog. It would take your home computer hours of work just to keep things updated, let alone run it. So instead, we fake it. The easiest way to do this is to turn on ''SubSurfaces'' (we saw this in [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Detailing Your Simple Person 1|Detailing Your Simple Person 1]].) For our purposes, let's set the subdivision (''Levels'') to 2. Also, ensure our SubSurf algorithm is set to ''Catmull-Clark'' (this is the default setting).

Now, you'll notice that with SubSurf on, we lose a lot of hard edges that we had, essentially we have no sharp corners any more.  I don't know about you, but to me that doesn't make for a very interesting mountain range. So to restore our corners, we are going to use ''Weighted Creases for Subsurfs''.
* First turn off proportional editing with the '''OKEY''' , and ensure we're in side view with '''NUM3'''
**''Noob note: That means, the letter O key, not the zero key.  Also, NUM3 means &quot;3 ''on the numeric keypad,&quot;'' not on the top row of the keyboard.''
* Next, while still in edit mode, change to ''Edge Select'' mode with '''CTRL+TAB''' and select ''Edges''.  Alternatively press ''Edge Select Mode'' button at the bottom of the object window.
* In the Tool Shelf at left, select the Options tab, then under Edge Select Mode, choose Tag Crease.
* On our Sharp Falloff mountain, the second one we did, select the two edges on the right. ''(see image below)''[[Image:Blender3DNoobtoPro-SharpMtnCreasing.PNG|right]]
* Press '''SHIFT+EKEY''' or '''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Edit &amp;rarr; Edges &amp;rarr; Crease SubSurf'', then move the mouse away from the edge until the edge ''Crease'' reads 1.000 in the 3D viewport header. If moving the cursor there seems to be impossible, just hit 1 and enter.
As you move the cursor away from the edge you will notice two things. The first is that the edge becomes thicker as we move from it; this is showing how much of a crease we have (with ''Draw Creases'' turned on).  The second is that you will notice the subsurfed mesh moving closer to the edge as the sharpness increases.

==Naturalness==

Press '''CTRL+TAB''' and select vertices. Then go into front view '''NUM1'''. Select the second vertex from the top in the centre of our Sharp Falloff mountain, then go into side view '''NUM3'''. Push '''GKEY''' and drag the vertex inwards, not too far or your mountain will come out of itself on the other side. Just bring it in enough to make a small indent.

Then grab the top vertex and pull it down a small amount.
You will notice that there is a small &quot;crunch&quot; in your mountain.

Don't forget to select all, press '''WKey''' and hit the '''shade smooth''' button to smooth everything out.

OK, so your mountains are starting to shape up.  But they still look a bit too neat.  You could spend time moving each individual vertex but the chances are your model will still lack the natural feel.  What we need is some chaos.  Thankfully this is quite easy to accomplish.  Firstly select the vertices that make up your mountains, all of them and a few around the base (box and circle select will make this easier).  Select a few vertices between the mountains too.  Next we use something called fractals.  Fractals are chaotically (i.e. randomly) generated variables.  In short you can use these variables to give your mountains a &quot;wobbly&quot; look.  

[[File:Fractal.xcf|thumb|Fractal option in 2.6.x]]
In the Tools tab of the Tool Shelf, press Subdivide (under Mesh Tools), then look at the Subdivide submenu below. The value in the Fractal box is the strength of the fractal.  1 is very low and will barely change your model.  100 is very high and will twist your models into very odd shapes indeed.  Have a play with different values until you find one that you like.  Around about 15-30 should do it.  Hit OK and presto, your mountains have been transformed from clinical neatness, to lumpy chaos.


* If you make too many fractals, your computer will slow down. However, the more fractal you add, the more bumpy and realistic it looks!

''Noob Note: Repeatedly using the fractal tool seems to rapidly multiply the amount of vertices on your canvas.  I suggest using the tool once, and if the result isn't satisfying, undo the result ('''CTRL + Z''') and try it again with a different fractal strength.  Even after undo, your selected vertices remain selected.''

''Noob Note #2: If you have a new enough version of Blender (2.49 and up definitely has it, not sure about lower versions), there is a setting called Random in the Proportional Editing settings. Using this with a high radius may give a desired result for you without adding more mesh.''

== Adding your guy with the hat ==
If you changed to a new layer--
press ('''SHIFT''') select the layer with your guy on it or ('''SHIFT + 1'''). This will display both layers.  If you would like to move the landscape from the second layer to the first then with the landscape selected, press ('''M'''), and select the layer(s) you would like it on.
note- make sure you're in object mode.
If you started a new project--
To insert your guy with a hat, you can simply go to '''file''' &gt; '''append or link'''(shift+F1).  
* Then select the file from the previous tutorial.  
* You will then see a list of objects you can insert or ‘append’. 
* First go into the 'Object' folder. Unless you renamed him/her, your person will probably be named “cube.” Select it. 
* Make sure that 'Append' button is pressed; otherwise you will not be able to scale or translate, or edit your model at all. (The 'Link' button will link a copy of your object into the current scene, and will update any changes when you reload the file. Unfortunately, this includes location and size, so we will not use it right now.)
* Press 'Load Library' to place your guy into the mountain scene. Please note, the ''Load Library'' button is top right. Confusingly, there is some text bottom left that says ''Load Library'' as well, but isn't clickable. 
* Repeat the process to get the hat (probably named “circle”).  To reset the parental relationship, see the instructions at the end of the [[../Putting Hat on Person/]] tutorial.  To scale them to the appropriate size, go to object mode by pressing '''TAB''' (unless of course you are already there).  Select the object you want to resize, then press the '''SKEY''' and use the cursor to scale as you see fit.  To undo any mistakes, use '''CTRL+Z'''.

'''Noob Note:''' To import the file once you have the list select the item, i.e. cube, and in the bottom right select &quot;Active Layer&quot; that will append it to your current proj when you click &quot;Load Library&quot; your work should be visible now.

'''Noob Note:''' Multiple items may be appended simultaneously. For instance: both 'cube' and 'circle' objects can be ''appended'' at the same time by highlighting both object names within the file browser by means of a RMB Click. RMB on object again to deselect.
