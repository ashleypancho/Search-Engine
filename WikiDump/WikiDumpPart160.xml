      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programme management  ==

''The cycle approach''&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; Program management is the process of managing a program that is made up by multiple inter-dependent projects. It includes direction in designing, implementing, evaluating and integrating the projects. Program Management also reflects the emphasis on co-ordinating and prioritising resources across projects, departments and partners, to ensure that resource allocation is efficiently managed and that work methods are in line with the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/Organizational Culture|organizational culture]].&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; 
Stages of Programme Cycle Management&lt;br /&gt;
*[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Managing Programmes/Program identification|Program identification]]

* [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Managing Programmes/Program evaluation|Program evaluation]]
* [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Managing Programmes/Ending a programme|Ending a programme]]
 
Programmes an expression of the  [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The Organization’s Vision|organization’s vision]] and are conceived as concrete articulation of the  [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The Organization’s mission| organization’s mission]] and the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/Organizational Culture|organizational culture]].  Programmes allow the organization to be [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The projectized organization|projectized]], organize and sharing [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The Learning organization|learning]].

Programmes are implemented through [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Projects|projects]]. (In a sense the &quot;projects&quot; can be considered as the &quot;activities&quot; of a programme - that is why sometimes projects are also called &quot;actions&quot;). The difference is that while the activities of a project are defined when the project is planned, projects (i.e. program actions) are developed later, once the programme was broadly defined. Program management provides a layer above [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects|project management]] establishing a framework where projects can be run successfully, but leaving project management to the project management teams. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;''(Note: Organizations that concretize their mission into programmes that are implemented through projects are called [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The projectized organization|projectized organizations]].


[[Image:Pcm.jpg|thumb|The cycle approach to p.m.]]


Improving the programme management includes:
* Manage the current programmes revising scope and schedules  on the basis of the results provisionally achieved and the quality provisionally obtained so as to put the programme in track with the expected objectives and results.
* Assess the organizational scope and the beneficiary needs for further programme design and development.
* Improve the organization's [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Partnership Management|partnership management]]
* Improve the  organization [[Development Cooperation Handbook/How do we Monitor and Evaluate Projects and Programmes?|monitoring and evaluation system]]. 

In this manual we will illustrate the various aspect of Programme Cycle Management through the description of the phases&lt;br&gt; 

The programme evaluation will lead to a decision whether to end the organization involvement with a programme or to start a new cycle of programme management. 



''(Note: In the development activities program management generally follows the cycle approach, that utilizes as a basic management tool: the ''[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Managing Programmes/Programme management/Logical Framework Approach|''logical framework'']]''.)''

&lt;br&gt; 

Governance is the act, process, or power of governing (an organization, a company, a community, a state, etc..)&lt;br&gt;Governance is defined by three fundamental characteristics:&lt;br&gt;the hierarchical order that assign different levels in the work organization;&lt;br&gt;the complex of all rights and duties which specifically belong to each organizational level;&lt;br&gt;the way by which communication occur between the hierarchical levels.&lt;br&gt;See Professional figures&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The elements that characterize the governance are its culture and its norms. (See Organizational Culture&amp;nbsp;; Professional reputation and standards)&lt;br&gt;Programs need to define a clear framework and supervision for the organizational activities (projects) because project activities have an impact on the social context where they are implemented as well as on the organisation image and on its work culture. &lt;br&gt;Project managers co-ordinate individual projects are overseen by the Program Manager, who accounts to the donors community and to the Board of Directors of the organisation. 
&lt;br /&gt;

Internal communication within the programme teams is to meet their four major communication needs:&lt;br&gt;Responsibility of each team member for different parts of the project &lt;br&gt;Coordination information that enables team members to work together efficiently &lt;br&gt;Status information tracking the progress, identifying problems and enabling team members to take corrective action &lt;br&gt;Authorization information - decisions made by beneficiaries, sponsors, and upper management - that relates to the project and its project/programme purpose environment, and enables the team members to keep all project decisions synchronized. &lt;br&gt;Internal communications happen primarily through team meetings, memos, voice mail, and e-mail. Project managers need to be able to write, speak, and listen well, lead meetings and resolve conflicts effectively. &amp;nbsp;See also [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Communication Management|Project communication management]]) 
&lt;br /&gt;

A good program will also identify and attribute specific responsibility in the programme management team in generating project and animate the process of producing the programme results chain (from project deliverable to outcomes, up to programmes impacts) so that the steps of the process are specifically attributed to the managerial structure, where specific professional positions are considered primarily accountable for expected results;&lt;br&gt;considering internal audit and budget tracking as programme implementation actions, so reporting about them clearly and evaluate their efficiency and transparency. 

&lt;br&gt; 

Subsidiarity is he principle that government power ought to reside at the lowest feasible level (i.e. at the local or regional level, instead of the national or supranational level, unless the latter presents clear advantages)&lt;br&gt;that The decisions should be taken at the lowest level appropriate to the matter in hand so as to encourage more direct involvement of the persons usually affected. 

As stakeholders increasingly demand accountability and transparency, it is becoming imperative that Impact Reports reveal:&lt;br&gt;How programmes are contributing to greater transparency and accountability among stakeholders&lt;br&gt;Financial information of programmes so that impact is also measured in terms of cost efficiency&lt;br&gt;Reveal more lessons learnt and actions taken to follow this up&lt;br&gt;Reveal the logical linkages between outputs, outcomes and impacts.&lt;br&gt;M&amp;amp;E, when absorbed down at all levels of the organizational structure, are also strategic in making each team member more accountable for their specific tasks and making the teams accountable for their capacity to generate the communication climate that empowers each member to fulfil her/his role. 

A fundamental of project management is that&amp;nbsp;:&lt;br&gt;a good deal of managerial autonomy (from institutional superiors) is given to the project manager to lead the project team to implement the Project Plan Document, in order to deliver the project results according the methodology indicated in the plan and within the cost and time limits previously defined;&lt;br&gt;the project manager and the project team have no authority to change project scope and methodology, nor to increase budget and time allocations and that for whatever modification to the project plan they have to get the approval of the other stakeholders through a previously defined change process that will lead to formally agreed&lt;br&gt;Changes to Project Scope, &lt;br&gt;Changes to the Project Schedule &lt;br&gt;Changes to the Costs Established in the Project Budget.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;(See clarifying the relationship: Responsibilities of Project Managers and programme Managers)&lt;br&gt;See also: &lt;br&gt;Required characteristics of the project manager&lt;br&gt;the 3 level hierarchy of project/programme objectives; &lt;br&gt;Establishing an M&amp;amp;E system&lt;br&gt;Image &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Organization and sector of activity &lt;br&gt;Organizational Culture &lt;br&gt;Characteristics of a development aid organization&lt;br&gt;The Organization’s mission statement.&lt;br&gt;Organization development - How to Empower the employees (and therefore the organization)&lt;br&gt;Organizational and Individual Change&lt;br&gt;The projectized organization&lt;br&gt;Middle Management Capabilities, Empowerment and Accountability - &lt;br&gt;Politics, Power, and Influence&lt;br&gt;Characteristics of a &quot;learning organization&quot; - The Knowledge-Based Organization: Managing Its Human Resources -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;br&gt; 

A good programme design will give answers to the following questions: 

*What is the cultural and policy approach that is expected to be used in the implementation methodology?&amp;nbsp; 
*What is the expected quality standard and how to achieve it? 
*How will the project or programme be monitored, evaluated and its impact measured?&lt;br&gt; 
*How will the organization learn from the programme?&lt;br&gt; 
*How are cross-sectoral issues of development considered in the programme?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Achieving professional reputation through the application of high standards in all aspects of organizational culture and management style is a fundamental requirement for generating an organizational image that is a prerequisite for a successful partnership management. 

What is &quot;quality&quot; in development/humanitarian programmes and how can we set the &quot;standards&quot;?
“Quality” in programmes refers to the minimum standards that managers and teams must maintain in what and how they do programmes and the impact, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, accountability and transparency of outputs and processes achieved in all phases of programming and in all sectors of programme implementation. 
These standards are expressed in mandatory procedures, communication and planning systems of the organisation and/or donors, national laws, stakeholder requests, etc.
Besides focusing on project performance, quality issues revolve around the team’s ways of working and relationships between the various players in the region, including areas such as performance management, fundraising, resource allocation, project management, budgeting, spending, human resources, organisational decision-making and programme support.
A good programme design will consider how to monitor and evaluate during and after the implementation phase (in itinere and ex post). It will therefore decide what are the indicators and what are the sources of information for judging the efficiency, the effectiveness and the impact.  Information sources may be independent from the programme/project management team and the organization. Others will be the internal evaluation tasks that will collect data concerning processes and outcomes. (see some Impact level indicators)   see Project Integration and Support

Programme designers will consider the standard methods of collecting and analyzing  data and will adopt those that are seen as most suitable. Eventually a new approach may be proposed.   After deciding on the method there will be an illustration of the evaluation activity within the program/project, including the indications regarding how to use the monitoring/evaluation results for improved programme/project management for organization development  and for employee empowerment and learning.  (see  evaluation reporting methods; and methods for  generating acceptance for the evaluation reports).   The elements of an evaluation action are illustrated in the chapter on program evaluation.

An evaluation based programme cycle management, is the key factor of programme quality. In fact in order to ensure  program quality programme managers need to use the feed back of monitoring and evaluation in order to check whether the programme or project is being implemented according to plan; assess whether the programme of project is resulting in the changes or impacts we anticipated; consider how sustainable the programme or project impact is likely to be; consider how successfully the programme or project is addressing or having an impact on gender issues; identify key learning and action points to feed back into this programme or project and inform future projects, programmes and policy.  (see also Quality Assessment of  Evaluation Reports )
 
The participatory approach to all aspects of the programme cycle management will ensure at the same time high quality operational standards, transparency and accountability.
 
A good programme will strengthen the advocacy  component in the country programme for example in women’s rights and gender equity, water and sanitation and public health, etc.
 
 
Basic principles of programme quality in aid organizations are:
* The programme is managed within the value system of the organizational culture
* Programs are designed and implemented following all the stages of the programme cycle
* Projects are conceived and managed within the programs frameworks
* Programmes are constantly evaluated and the feed back of evaluation gives indication for improved programming as well as for organizational development
* There is a healthy and positive communication management that generates trust and cooperation within and without the program team with internal and external stakeholders
* Learning is fostered in the organizations, the knowledge resulting from program activities is capitalized and re-used for improved program efficacy and for organizational development
* There is transparency and accountability in all the aspects of organizational culture and managerial style.

&lt;br&gt;Integrate with Communicating Financial Information and Control and Manage Costs Established in the Project Budget Tasks and Structure and Capitalization

Tracking of finances is an important part of Program Management; programme costs includes, besides the sum of the project costs, wider costs of administering the program

The financial plan is a critical element of any project/program plan. This module discusses why the financial plan is so important, what financial statements are necessary, and how financial projections are made. In addition, the module discusses common mistakes that managers must be careful to avoid.

A programme should contain budget indication regarding what is the expected cost of the projects and of project origination, supervision and evaluation. it should also give inductions on how the projects are expected to obtain the financial resources they will need.

This was prepared for a busness plan of a profit company and need to be wriretten for the programme plan of an NGO&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;



2. Checklist for Preparing Financial Projections&lt;br&gt;The financial plan is the culmination of the earlier section of the project/program plan. Each previous section impacts the projected costs, sales, etc. The following is a checklist for assembling a financial plan:&lt;br&gt;1. Assemble the key points of the project/program plan from the previous sections of the plan.&lt;br&gt;2. Identify the organization structure of the project/program, indicating who will be responsible for making the key decisions with regard to operations, marketing, production, financial management, staffing, and legal compliance.&lt;br&gt;3. Identify the operational activities that are required for the project/program to operate. &lt;br&gt;4. Identify the operating support systems required for the organization to operate. &lt;br&gt;5. Identify the information that is needed to turn these activities into estimates of the following:&lt;br&gt;6. Take the estimates and post them as entries into the accounting model. These estimates will enable managers to compose the key statements which include:&lt;br&gt;Balance statement &lt;br&gt;Income statement&lt;br&gt;Cash flow statement&lt;br&gt;7. Modify key estimates and prepare iterations on the financial plans for a more optimistic scenario and a less optimistic scenario.

&lt;br&gt;3. Income Statement &lt;br&gt;The income statement is perhaps the most noticeable element of the financial plan since it summarizes the profit potential of a new or existing project/program. The income statement typically is divided into the following:&lt;br&gt;Revenues – The total amount of funds coming into the project/program from sales.&lt;br&gt;Cost of Goods/Services – The amount of funds required to produce the product or service.&lt;br&gt;Expenses – Other areas that require funds including marketing, salaries, rent, etc.&lt;br&gt;Essentially, the revenues are totaled, and from them are subtracted the cost of producing the goods and the other expenses the organization has incurred. What’s left is referred to as the pre-tax profit. From this, taxes are subtracted leaving the Profit after Taxes.

It is important to consider the perspective of the audience in reading financial plans. Lenders will be looking for stable profits that enable the organization to make the determined loan payments. Investors, however, want to see that there is the potential for growth. They may be less concerned about stable profits, and even be willing to see an operating loss for a few years, providing the future outlook supports growth. In compiling the income statement, managers should be sure to note the following:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Often elements of the plan are presented as a percentage of sales. For example, cost of goods sold is often represented as a certain percentage of sales, depending on the product’s margin. By highlighting the percentages, they can easily be compared to other organizations. The percentages of the various items in the income statement should be similar to sector of activity standards or, if not, the difference should be explained.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The income statement must be compatible with the rest of the project/program plan. If certain limitations or restrictions have been noted in the plan, their affect must be visible in the financial plans. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The income statement should accurately reflect the organization’s tax status. 

4. Balance Sheet&lt;br&gt;While the income statement highlights a organizations projected profit potential, the balance sheet provides a snapshot of the organization’s financial health. By looking at a balance sheet, the audience can determine the organization’s financial strengths and weaknesses at a certain point in time. A balance sheet encompasses and summarizes the following:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Assets – These includes those things that the organization owns. There are several types of assets. Current assets include liquid assets such as cash, inventory, and accounts receivable. Fixed assets are less liquid assets such as plants, equipment, etc. Intangible assets are assets that cannot be touched – such as licenses, brand names, good will, etc.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Liabilities – Liabilities are the things that a organization owes. This can include any outstanding loans, accounts payable, salary payable, etc.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Net Worth – The difference between the value of a organization’s assets and the amount of their liability is called the organization’s net worth.&lt;br&gt;A organization’s initial balance sheet is relatively simple to prepare. It simply reflects the capital that needs to be raised (debt or equity) at start-up and how that capital will be spent (assets). In addition to this balance sheet, managers should also project balance sheets for the next three to five years, allowing investors to see how the proportion of assets and liabilities is expected to change. In addition, managers should consider the following in preparing balance statements:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;First-time managers often believe they can fund a new project/program entirely through debt. However, almost all lenders require some portion of the capital be provided through equity to other investors.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lenders and investors also want to see a significant financial commitment from the manager. This indicates that the individual is committed to the success of the project/program because they have personal wealth to lose. Investors and lenders don’t want to support a organization where the manager can simply walk away.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Young organizations require liquid assets to survive. They need cash and other liquid assets to be able to weather unexpected emergencies.

Cash Flow Statement&lt;br&gt;The cash flow statement is the most critical of all the financial forecasts in a project/program plan. While many may look to the income statement to get an understanding of the profit generated by the organization, the cash flow statement documents the amount of cash actually flowing into and out of the organization. Thus, the cash flow statement represents the organization’s net cash position, rather than the profit. The cash flow statement is extremely telling, because it shows where cash is going. A organization can be delivering profits and still be bleeding cash or heading towards danger.

The cash flow statement springs from the income statement. Some key differences are:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cash flow statement reflects the actual receipt of cash from sales or other sources. The income statement records revenue when it is earned, not when the funds are actually collected.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cash flow statement includes the receipt of cash from all sources, including sales, money from debt or equity, sales of an asset, etc. The income statement will not include all of these.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cash flow statements reflect the expenses actually paid, while the income statement reflects the expenses incurred. This is important, especially with expenses that are paid over a period of time.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Income statements record the depreciation of assets such as plants and machinery. However, since this is an expense that does not involve the outflow of cash, it is not represented in the cash flow statement. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Acquisition of equipment or the payment of dividends or loan principal is not considered expenses on an income statement. However, they do involve cash, and are therefore represented on the cash flow statement.&lt;br&gt;Early in a organization’s life, cash is more critical than profitability because it represents the organization’s ability to survive and maintain operations.

6. Ratios&lt;br&gt;Often when looking at financial statements, any single elements on a balance sheet or income statement will have little meaning. However, by comparing the elements relative to one another, a great deal of information can be determined about a organization’s financial health. This is accomplished by looking at key ratios of elements of the income statement and balance sheet. These rations include the following:

Liquidity Ratios – These ratios typically compare all of some of the organization’s current assets to its current liabilities. This can show how liquid the organization is and how well they can meet their debt obligations in the near term. For example, the current ratio is the current assets divided by the current liabilities. The ratio should be positive, indicating that there are more current assets than the liabilities that are coming due.

Asset Management Ratios – These ratios can illustrate how well the organization is employing the assets that are at the organization’s disposal. For example, the inventory turnover is determined by the dividing the cost of goods sold by the amount of inventory. This indicates how often the inventory is being turned over. The higher the number, the faster the organization is selling inventory and the less time the product is sitting on the shelf.

Debt Ratios – These ratios help show how the organization is capitalized and how highly the organization is leveraged against lenders. These ratios allow readers to understand how the stable the organization is and what their capacity for raising further capital is. For example, the debt ratio divided the organization’s current liabilities by the total assets. This provides a percentage of the organization’s assets that are debt. The higher the percentage, the more leveraged the organization is and the more limited their ability to raise capital is.

Breakeven Analysis&lt;br&gt;Often times managers feel it is helpful to include a break-even analysis in the financial plan section. A break-even analysis demonstrates the level of sales that are required for a organization to meet its cash obligations and expenses. Essentially, once a organization passes the break-even point they begin generating profits. This is useful for investors who are eager to see returns on their investment and lenders who are concerned with the organization’s capacity to service debt. In addition, the break-even analysis demonstrates how long the organization expects to operate in a deficit. The break-even point is typically a major milestone in the life of a organization.

In order to conduct a breakeven analysis, managers should follow these steps:&lt;br&gt;1. Divide all cash obligations into fixed or variable obligations. Fixed obligations are those that do not vary with the level of sales such as rent or debt repayment. Variable obligations do vary with sales, such as cost of goods sold.&lt;br&gt;2. Calculate the total fixed costs and the total variable cost. Total fixed costs should be stated as an absolute number (i.e. $50,000) while total variable costs should be stated as a percentage of sales (i.e. 55%).&lt;br&gt;3. Insert these figures into the following formula:&lt;br&gt;Break-even sales = Fixed costs/contribution margin&lt;br&gt;(Note: the contribution margin = 1 – variable costs as a percentage of sales)&lt;br&gt;For example, using these examples, the break-even would be:&lt;br&gt;Break-even sales = $50,000/1-.55&lt;br&gt;Break-even sales = $111,111&lt;br&gt;This figure does have a number of limitations. The size of the operation will have a large impact on the break-even level of sales. However, this calculation can provide managers with an idea of what volume is needed in order for the organization to become a self-supporting enterprise.

8. Assumptions &lt;br&gt;In order to make projections about the future, managers must make a certain set of assumptions about the market, the competition, the sales levels, the economy, etc. managers often feel uneasy about making these assumptions, however they are a necessary and normal part of making financial projections. However, managers must consider each assumption carefully, and strive to make them as strong as possible. Financial projections are only as reliable as the assumptions they are based upon.

Since assumptions are so important, managers should spend some time in the financial plan discussing their assumptions and how they came to them. Readers want to know why the founders feel their assumptions are valid. The following are key areas that managers need to make assumptions when creating a financial plan for a new project/program:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Inventory turnover&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Accounts receivable collection period&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Accounts payable payment period&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Startup and future capital expenditures&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Useful life of the organization’s assets and depreciation schedules&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Interest rates on debt&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Income tax rate&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Expected capacity and utilization of plants and equipment&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Production levels, seasonality, etc.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sales and share of the market&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Growth and success based on management training and the learning curve&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sales by market and product and the respective margins of each&lt;br&gt;managers can use sector of activity data, effective research, common sense, and many other methods to determine what assumptions to use. However, when in doubt, more conservative assumptions should always be used.

Know the Numbers&lt;br&gt;It is not enough for an manager to merely complete a financial plan; they must also understand how the various elements interact with one another. This is often difficult for many managers, especially those without a solid background in accounting and finance. However, skilled managers need not be professional accountants, they only need to understand the basic relationships between each aspect of their organization’s financial plan.

For example, potential investors or lenders are going to ask tough questions to an manager prior to providing the capital for the enterprise. These questions could be specific questions about how the manager believes he or she will be able to reach the projected sales level, or what would happen to the organization’s income if the cost for a key product ingredient increased dramatically. managers must understand these questions and know how to answer them.

In addition, managers must know what the projections are and be able to track the organization’s progress along with them. They must know how fast inventory is turning over, how sales are going, and how much of the organization is leveraged with debt. Each of these questions will be critical for ensuring the organization is on the path to meeting the financial projections. If the organization is going to fall short of these projections, then the manager must understand what is wrong and attempt to correct it in a timely matter.

Each of the instances speaks to the fact that managers cannot be passive with regards to the financial projections of the organization. They must have a strong understanding, but also a level of comfort with the financial projections and progress of the organization. Otherwise, the organization will drift off course and the managers will be unaware that there is a problem.

&lt;br&gt;10. Common Mistakes&lt;br&gt;Crafting a set of financial projections is no easy task. However, by understanding the common mistakes made by others, managers can increase the likelihood of their financial plans being a success. The following are a list of these key errors:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Failure to provide financial statements – some managers ignore the need of providing financial projections, hoping to convince investors on the strength of their ideas alone.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Unrealistic incomes/profit potential – Investors are wary of managers who pain a picture of a future that is a little too rosy.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Failure to clarify assumptions – When managers fail to clarify their assumptions, they leave the reader confused and doubtful.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Underestimating expenses – Many managers assume they’ll be able to keep expenses very low, which is difficult for a young organization.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Salaries are too big – No investor wants to provide capital for a organization that plans on overpaying their employees.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Failure to project the downside – By not providing a sensitivity analysis, managers risk the appearance that they have not considered what happens if the organization performs below expectations.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Failure to have the statements checked – managers often rush to have their financial projections completed, however they do not have their statements reviewed by a reputable accountant. This can leave glaring errors or poor assumptions that could have been easily corrected.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The proposed rate of return is too low – Often managers create a financial plan that offers investors a rate of return that is lower than what they could earn from similar project/programs. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Crafting a plan to provide a specific return – managers who are eager to show a strong return often craft a plan that show the organization meeting that goal. However, the underlying power of the project/program is not enough to support the goal.

One of the many responsibilities of a Project Manager is to enhance the ability of each Project Team member to contribute to the project, while also fostering individual growth and accomplishment. At the same time, each individual must be encouraged to share ideas and work with others toward a common goal. 


Getting work done in teams requires managing both the task (what we do) and the process (how we do it). Some of the task related functions include fair work distribution. This is important because team members would like to think the work is fairly shared. Because effective teams also share in the rewards, unfair allocation of work will affect the team in a negative way. 

#Internal communication within the project teams is to meet their four major communication needs: 
#Responsibility of each team member for different parts of the project 
#Coordination information that enables team members to work together efficiently 
#Status information tracking the progress, identifying problems and enabling team members to take corrective action 
#Authorization information - decisions made by beneficiaries, sponsors, and upper management - that relates to the project and its project/programme purpose environment, and enables the team members to keep all project decisions synchronized.

Internal communications happen primarily through team meetings, memos, voice mail, and e-mail. Project managers need to be able to write, speak, and listen well, lead meetings and resolve conflicts effectively. See also Project communication management)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 

The most common form of employee performance appraisal&amp;nbsp;is management by objectives, in which employees and their managers set goals together for the upcoming period and then measure the degree to which the employee achieved the goals. 

This method provides unambiguous criteria that are less susceptible to personal biases. However, if improperly managed it also can lead to a mentality of “results at any cost” or not reflect on-the-job problem solving. 

A management by objectives is centred to what is being produced and delivered, rather than on what tasks have been performed. &lt;br&gt;Therefore it leaves a margin of responsibility to the employee to plan how to produce the expected outputs and achieve the project objectives.&lt;br&gt;However the &quot;how&quot; to achieve should be consistent with the organizational culture and with the basic requirement of fostering a healthy communication climate. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; 

Performance objectives are not invented. It is not possible for the employee to decide what s/he has to do to earn her salary! Nor can the manager establish arbitrary what the employee has to do. Project objectives are deduced from: 

#The job profile for which the employee was hired (and that determines the pay scale) 
#The objectives of the project / programme to which the employee is expected to contribute as a team member by undertaking of specific tasks; 
#The communication climate of the team; 
#The overall working style and the organizational culture of which the employee is a human resource.

So when an employee and her/his manger agree on the performance objectives means that they sustain each other interpretation of the 4 determinants of the employee performance objectives.&lt;br&gt;Agreeing on the objectives means to make sure that the employee and the managers have the same expectation about what the employee should achieve. That becomes what the rest of the team will rightfully expect from the employee, both in terms of quantity and quality of deliverables and other concrete outputs. 

&lt;br&gt;SMART Objectives are: 

*Specific (to the person and her/his specific tasks); 
*Measurable (the criteria are set on how the performance will be reviewed); 
*Achievable (the persons have enough resources, skills, knowledge, and time); 
*Relevant (objectives must relate to job profile and programme/projects plans); 
*and once agreed must be articulated in Time-related shedules (realistic dates are set for the delivery of expected outputs).

As an employee proposing the objectives to your manager remember to:&lt;br&gt;first 

*review your job profile; 
*consult organization manuals and standard procedures; 
*understand well the organizational culture of your organization and the communication climate of your team; 
*read the project / programme at which you are expected to contribute

then 

*make your performance objectives consistent with the project / programme to which you are expected to contribute as a team member; 
*list out all deliverables expected from you according to your job profile and the project / programme at which you are working; 
*relate the &quot;what&quot; you will achieve (the objectives) with the &quot;how&quot; you will do it (the list of deliverables and other concrete outputs expected by you. 
*be concrete not vague: do not say &quot;contribute&quot;, &quot;support&quot; etcetera (impossible to measure)&amp;nbsp;; say &quot;produce this&quot;, &quot;review this&quot;, &quot;approve that&quot;, &quot;evaluate that&quot;, etc. (so it will possible to verify if you have done it.) 
*Do not include in your performance objectives the results of team work but only what the team can expect from you as your specific contribution to the team work. 
*do not try to impress your manager by adding other extra objectives or by gold plating your promises: give commitments only for what you the others can count upon (you will eventually try to put extra quality in what you do but never put extra activities or extra objectives). 
*resist to any attempt by your manager to give you too many or too vague objectives. 
*relate what you are planning to do with plans on how to develop your existing skills, knowledge, or ways of working.&amp;nbsp; 
*As a manager you have one objective related to the performance management of your manages

&lt;br&gt; 

As an manager proposing the objectives to your managee remember to: first 

&lt;br&gt;refer to organization manuals and standard procedures;

*understand the cultural background of the employee and the experience within the organization,
*consider the capacity of the rest of the team and its specific existing communication climate 
*review the project / programme at which you your managee is expected to contribute
*understand what will motivate your managee to perform at her best.

then

*assign performance objectives consistent with the project / programme to which your managee is expected to contribute as a team member 
*clearly assign tasks and explain them.
*clearly identify all the task outputs that your managee is expected to deliver to the rest of the team;
*relate the &quot;what&quot; you expect your managee to achieve (the objectives) with the &quot;how&quot; s/he will do it (the list of deliverables and other concrete expected outputs )
*be concrete not vague: do not say &quot;contribute&quot;, &quot;support&quot; etcetera&amp;nbsp;; say &quot;produce&quot;, &quot;review&quot;, &quot;approve&quot;, &quot;evaluate&quot;, etc. (so it will possible to verify if it was done)
*do not include in the expected performance the outcomes of team work but only what the team can expect from your managee as your contribution to the team work.
*never assign too many or too difficult objectives;
*do not assign objectives and tasks for witch you will forgo an eventual unsatisfactory performance (if objectives are not essential they should not be listed; if they are essential their failure should not pass unnoticed); 
*resist to any attempt by your managee to make too many promises or gold plate them;
*do not burden unevenly the team members but share equally work load and goodies;
*understand how to develop the existing skills and knowledge of your managee, so that s/he can perform satisfactory,
*motivate your managee to work with enthusiasm.&lt;br&gt;





Agreed performance objectives will form the basis for&amp;nbsp;planning the employee activities and for reviewing the employee performance.&lt;br&gt;

Effective managers take groups of people and turn them into real teams, and turn the members into team players.



To do so they help team members:



1. Build a trusting relationships with the other members;

2. Understand the need for communicating and discussing ideas and plans;

3. Appreciate the diversity and importance of all individuals and their unique skills;

4. Clarify what roles each member will fulfill;

5. Feel comfortable contributing their own ideas and insights;

6. Feel comfortable listening and being open to others’ ideas and insights; 

7. Develop pride in being part of their team.



Effective managers use whatever is available to help turn strangers into teams.

To accomplish anything, a small group has to be able to work together. As in a well-tuned machine, or a championship sports team, each member has to function smoothly, with all the effort aimed at common goal. &lt;u&gt;Four factors must be considered&lt;/u&gt;: 

&lt;br&gt; 

*'''1. Do the members get along'''? It’s nice to like one another, but it’s not necessary. What is necessary is that they can get along and work with one another.



*'''2. Are the members satisfied?''' This question usually has less to do with the group’s purpose—the product—than it does with the working conditions—the process—and the way members were “chosen” for the group. People who are there because they want to be there are more likely to be satisfied than those who were ordered to attend. Working conditions are also an issue. Is the work area comfortable? Do they have enough space for the group as a whole and for their own individual needs? Do they get the time, supplies, information, freedom, and respect that they need in order to do their jobs?

&lt;br&gt; 

*'''3. Are they committed to the project?''' Is the project something they believe in? Is it something they want to see happen? Are they doing the job simply because it was assigned to them by a superior. Or are they ambivalent—or even opposed—to the job they are supposed to be doing?

&lt;br&gt; 

*'''4. Do they want to stay in the group?''' This is a function of how well the group gets along and works together. Do they feel part of the group? Is there an esprit de corps? Do they feel a sense of commitment to the group itself? Do they want to continue to work with the other members until they finish the job?

&lt;br&gt; Eperts say that individual and team motivation is the leading factor affecting the productivity of a project team. There are a few steps the Project Manager should take to ensure that the foundation of sound motivation is in place in the project environment. &lt;br&gt;In 1985, I had an assignment to select videos for a training program for front-line supervisors in an engineering services organization. I watched many videos on hiring interviews, performance evaluations, discipline, and motivation. On the subject of motivation, I viewed a number of videos and then reviewed them in my mind to see which one to pick for our training course. I was surprised to observe that they all said essentially the same thing. There are three things required to have a motivated employee: first, provide clear ownership of a defined task; second, ensure the person has the ways and means to do the task; and finally, follow-up with timely feedback and hold the individual accountable for results. The more I use these three steps, the more profound, powerful, and simple they become to me. I've packaged this information as &quot;the motivation triangle,&quot; to help make it easy for people to remember and apply.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



[[Image:Motivationtriangle.jpg|left|290px|The Motivation Triangle]]The Motivation Triangle

Much of my work as a project manager involves applying the motivation triangle throughout the day. I make sure everyone has work to do. Do they have enough assignments in their queue so they have something to work on if they hit a road block or get bored? Are their tasks well defined? Do they know what the results should look like? After that, I make sure they have the wherewithal to accomplish their tasks. Do they have the tools and training? Do they have the ways and means to accomplish the task? Do they need help? Do they need me to make any phone calls to get information, tools, or assistance? If they have all they need, then I leave them alone to do their work. I make sure we agree on what results are expected, but I try to let them decide how they want to do it. A few days later, I'll drop by and say, &quot;How's it going?&quot; Then is the time to praise good quality work, done on time, and to encourage better performance if progress seems inadequate. This might be formalized as a weekly review of task status, to update schedules and assess earned-value or task percent complete.&lt;br&gt;More than 9 times out of 10, this simple process will produce motivated workers. The ones who do not respond to this are special cases that need to be handled through a formal process of performance counseling.&lt;br&gt;The idea of giving people clear task ownership is VERY important in project work. The motivation triangle applies to managing project managers as well as to managing team members. It even applies to managing whole organizations!

&lt;br&gt;'''Building Project Disciplines in Organizations'''&lt;br&gt;Recently I was working on a presentation that addressed what it takes to deploy project management methodologies in organizations. A methodology implementation requires three indispensable components. It must address &quot;what&quot; should be done on projects, that is, it must prescribe policies and practices to be used in the project environment. Next, it must address &quot;how&quot; the practices should be applied. This may involve definitions, instructions, training, and help (forms, examples, templates, systems, data). The final part required is management FOLLOW-UP. Without follow-up, project management, and specifically implementation of project management disciplines in organizations, is just not going to happen (because it requires significant effort and resolve).&lt;br&gt;It turns out that the motivation triangle applies here too. To implement a methodology, you have to tell the organization what is expected of them. Next, you need to provide the tools and training so they can do what is expected. And finally, you need to have management follow-up to monitor the success of the implementation and to hold people accountable for doing what is required. 

'''&lt;br&gt;Superficial Project Management Solutions'''&lt;br&gt;When organizations have problems with projects, many organizations try to address it superficially by buying copies of Microsoft Project software or sending people to get training in Project Management 101. This is not an effectual way to improve project performance. Why? &lt;br&gt;This is addressing the second leg of the motivation triangle before the first leg. It is giving the troops the ways and means before they know what their responsibilies are. I've taught project management courses to people in organizations where the people said, &quot;We don't know why we are here.&quot; The training was just a frustration for them. The policies and practices need to be prescribed first. Then people can be profitably taught how to fulfill their responsibilities.&lt;br&gt;If the organization doesn't know what they want people to do, and sends them to training so they will figure it out, then management is not doing its job. Management needs to figure out what project/programme purpose it is in and then be diligent in learning what it takes to be successful in that project/programme purpose.&amp;nbsp;See the 10 Project Management Guiding Principles

&lt;br&gt;'''Worst Practices - To Avoid!'''

*Make it unclear who is responsible for tasks; don't trust anyone with clear ownership, but ask several people to get the job done.
*Keep yourself very busy, so team members will see how valuable you are, even if you have no time to supervise their assignments, solve problems, or monitor work methods.
*Assign new team members to tasks without adequate task definitions, guidance or training; use the sink or swim method for work assignments.
*Let poor performers continue without comment, and ignore gossip and dissension among project team members.
*Reward your excellent performers by giving them an impossible workload; let them be the heroes to carry the project on their backs.
*I'm not trying to be negative or sarcastic here, but it is sometimes helpful to describe negative behaviors we want to avoid to help us recognize them and not fall into the traps.

&lt;br&gt;'''Managing by Milestones'''&lt;br&gt;Projects are often stressful and hectic. It is hard to keep focused on what is important. It is normal on a stressful project for the Project Manager to have that glazed look of the deer caught in the headlights. The best way to cope with this is to rely on fundamental principles, to define achievable objectives, and focus on short-term successes. What needs to be done? Understand and document the requirements. How will we do it? Prepare a reasonable plan. Assign staff ownership of tasks. Make sure they have good task definition and the ways and means to accomplish the work.&lt;br&gt;The best feedback is success, so structure your project to be an endless series of little successes. On a challenging project, managing by mini-milestones is the only way to keep things moving. You could have a success every few days. Then celebrate and move on. Mini-milestones can lead to eventual project success if they are chosen well. This means that every significant task will be structured as a mini-milestone with criteria for determining when it is done.&lt;br&gt;For projects to succeed, the goals need to be well defined and clearly communicated to the project team. If definition and communication do not occur, successful project completion becomes a random stroke of luck (the odds of which are akin to winning the lottery). Effort engaged with poorly defined targets is futile and, consciously or not, the whole project team will sense this. An incomprehensible or unachievable goal lowers morale and kills enthusiasm and motivation. This, in turn, affects the quality of the work and further lowers chances of success.

&lt;br&gt;'''Build Team Dynamics'''&lt;br&gt;In addition to the benefits of having highly motivated individuals on your project team, there is an additional opportunity for increased team motivation and productivity. When building the project team, make sure people are committed to working hard for the team to succeed. Job satisfaction and career growth are often important goals for project team members. Find out what each team member win conditions are, and try to make these part of the project goals. When you are able to get your project staff to work well together towards a challenging goal (ideally in groups of 7, plus or minus 2), a real team may emerge. When a team gels, it can go way beyond a mere group of people. Team synergy transcends the mundane. It is supercharged. Not only does this produce high performance for the project, it also provides a genuinely satisfying human experience for the team members. Creating an environment in which such a team can gel is one of the ultimate goals of the Project Manager. 

&lt;br&gt;The Project Manager may consider implementing some of the following: 

*'''Team-Building Activities '''– these are actions taken specifically to improve the performance of the entire team. Activities can range from short items on a meeting agenda to extended, off-site professionally facilitated sessions. However implemented, team-building activities provide opportunities for team members to improve their interpersonal and working relationships.
*'''Team Recognition and Rewards '''– these are actions intended to promote, encourage, and reinforce desired behavior or exceptional performance. Frequently they are initiated by individuals at management level, but they are also very effective when initiated by an individual’s peer. In all cases, recognition programs must be documented clearly enough so team members understand what level of performance warrants an award. The primary objective for establishing an appropriate team environment is to improve overall project performance. When team members are encouraged to do their best and are motivated about a project, they are more likely to do whatever is necessary to improve their individual skills so they are more efficient and effective in performing their assigned activities. And when team members understand the importance of interacting with each other, they are more willing to identify and proactively deal with conflict. Resolving issues early leaves team members more time for producing actual project work. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''Note: Don’t underestimate the power of a box of donuts or a celebratory cake when the team reaches a major milestone!

&lt;br&gt; An effective meeting consists of a group of people who work together as a team toward achieving common goals and objectives. Here are some tips to build the cohesiveness a meeting needs in order to become a team. While this is aimed at continuing meetings and long-term projects, many of these techniques can also be adapted for short-term projects:



#Identify all present—all the participants, including yourself—as a group, and show that you are part of that group. Say “We,” not “I.” 
#Build a group tradition. That can be something a small as starting each meeting with bagels and cream cheese or chocolate cupcakes, to having team shirts, ties, or notebooks.
#Stress teamwork. 
#Get the group to recognize good work, and applaud it. 
#Set clear and obtainable group goals. If the final goal will take time to achieve, set a series of intermediate goals that will serve as measurable steps on the way to achieving that final goal.
#Give rewards to the group. It can be praise, a special dessert, a team jacket, certificate, a toy or keepsake. Whatever it is, it has to have special meaning within the group. 
#Treat members like people, not machines. Each member is an individual. They are not interchangeable. Let each one know how special and important they are to the group and the ultimate goal.&lt;br&gt;</text>

----
Integration is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.

Task of the Project Integration Management is to describe and organize all &quot;processes and activities needed to identify, combine, unify, and coordinate the various process and project management activities within the Project Management Process Groups&quot;.
One has to initiate a project, one has to plan the project, one has to execute the planned activities, one has to monitor and control the activities and results, and finally one has to close the project. And in all those phases one has to fulfill tasks concerning different aspects, which must be integrated into the big picture. Hence &quot;Integration  is making choices about where to concentrate resources and effort on any given day, anticipating potential issues, dealing with these issues before they become critical, and coordinating work for the overall project good&quot; (comp. PMBOK3, p. 77).

In the development sector every new project comes to life in the context of the existing social and political environment. When designing and implementing a project destined to have a social and economic impact, it is important to understand the other forces at work that will influence how the project deliverables will help in achieving the overall programme objectives and will lead towards the expected programme impact.

Forecasting and generating synergy between the project activities and the other social, policy, cultural and economic factors operating in the project environment can be the elements that decide the usefulness or not of the project. . It is important that people working on a project discover early in its lifecycle what its dependencies are, what services and resources are available, and how to integrate with them appropriately.

Who does Project Integration?

The project manager, as part of doing project planning, should identify key areas with which the project must integrate.
Actual integration work will typically be done by project team members working with suppliers of infrastructure services, external application services, or other resources. Since integration by definition is about the connections between your project and things outside of it, negotiation about where integration work happens, and who does it, is necessary and important

Scope is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.
 
Technical definition &quot;scope&quot;: the combination of all project goals and tasks, and the work required to accomplish them; the scope translates into the timeline and budget.
 
The project scope states what will and will not be included as part of the project.   
 
Scope provides a common understanding of the project for all stakeholders by defining the project’s overall boundaries. 
 
It establishes the boundaries of what the project will and will not accomplish. The scope statement eliminates any confusion or ambiguity that might still exist after considering the project's goal, objectives and high-level deliverable statements.

Task of the Project Scope Management is &quot;to ensure, that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully&quot;. In other words: The project Scope Management shall warrant that all of the required targets will be met and nothing more! A project target may be described indirectly as a feature of a result (product), but the intrinsic scope of the project itself is the work that must be done to create the product (comp. PMBOK3, p. 103).

Time is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Limited time is the one constraint of any project.

Deadlines is what the project team most commonly struggle to maintain the actions within.

In project management there are various tools and procedures that help managing time, like Gants, schedules, work breakdown structures, etc.

Task of the Project Time Management is to describe and execute all those &quot;processes required to accomplish timely completion of the project&quot; (comp. PMBOK3, p. 123).

Cost is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
Limited financial resources is the one constraint of any project.  Costs include the people and equipment who do the work, the materials they use, and all the other events and issues that require money or someone's time in a project.

The project team has to organize the work in oder to to mantain the actions within the budget available.

In project management there are various tools and procedures that help manging costs, like Cost Estimating, Budgeting, Cost and Schedule Control System, Cost Analysis.

[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Project Execution and Control|Project Execution and control]]

Task of the Project Cost Management is to describe and execute all those &quot;processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget&quot; (comp. PMBOK3, p.157).

Quality is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.
&lt;br /&gt;
Quality Management is the process of making sure that products or services are made to consistently high standards. It is achieved through a set of actions of the general management function which determines the quality policy, aims and responsibilities and realises them within the framework of quality by planning, control, ensuring and improving the quality.

The application of a quality management system in managing a process to achieve maximum beneficiary satisfaction at the lowest overall cost to the organization while continuing to improve the process.

The [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Project Quality|professional quality]] of the job done depends to a very great extend to the human quality of the persons who associate themselves in the organizations and to the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|communication climate]] within the organization. There is a formal difference between [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/Organizational Types|organizational types]] and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/Organizational Structure|organizational structures]]: but really makes the difference is the way the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/Organizational Culture|organizational identity]] is constructed and preservation and the cohesiveness of its [[Development Cooperation Handbook/How do we manage the human resources of programmes and projects?/Manage the Project Team|teams]]. 

The Project Quality Management has to plan and execute all those &quot;activities of the performing organization that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken&quot;: the main target is to establish a &quot;quality management system&quot; containing processes and procedures of &quot;quality planing, quality assurance, and quality control&quot; (comp. PMBOK3, p. 179)

The Project Risk Management &quot;  includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, responses and monitoring and control a project&quot;: the main task of Project Risk Managment is &quot;[...] to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and (to) decrease the probability and impact of events advers to the project&quot; (comp. PMBOK3, p. 237).

Risk is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.

A risk is the chance of something happening that will have an impact upon objectives. Risk can have both positive (upside risk) and negative (downside risk) consequences.

Project Risk Management is the process of evaluating alternative responses to project risk and selecting among them.

Risk management in projects/programmes include at least the following processes:

* [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Project Risk/Project risk management planning|Project risk management planning]]
* [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Project Risk/Monitor and control risks|Monitor and control risks]]

A project risk is a potential source of deviation from the project plan. Project risks can have a negative or positive impact on the project. Project risks that are negative are called threats. Project risks that are positive are called opportunities.

Responses to threat include:
* Reducing the probability of risk
* Developing contingency plans
* Passively accepting consequences.
* Transferring risk  (Insurance or subcontracting are examples of transferring risk)

Procurement is one of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/The 9 Topic Areas Of Project Management Knowledge|the 9 topic areas]] of project management knowledge.
The Project Procurement Management &quot;includes the processes to purchase or acquire the products, services, or results needed from outside the project team to perform the work&quot;. An organization can either be the buyer or the seller of these products, services and so on. The procurement management includes the contract management and the change control processes &quot;[...] required to administer contracts or purchase orders issued by authorized team members&quot; (comp. PMBOK3, p. 269)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Programme/Project Risk Management is the process of evaluating alternative responses to project risks and selecting among them.  It is the process of evaluating alternative responses to project risk and selecting among them.

A Risk management plan is a document prepared by a project manager to foresee risks, to estimate the effectiveness, and to create response plans to mitigate them. It also consists of the risk assessment matrix.

Project Risk Management  

A risk is defined as &quot;an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives. &quot;Risk is inherent with any project, and project managers should assess risks continually and develop plans to address them. The risk management plan contains an analysis of likely risks with both high and low impact, as well as mitigation strategies to help the project avoid being derailed should common problems arise. Risk management plans should be periodically reviewed by the project team in order to avoid having the analysis become stale and not reflective of actual potential project risks.

Risk management planning in projects/programmes include at least the following processes:

Risk Analysis  A systematic use of available information to determine how often specified events may occur and the magnitude of their consequences. it involves  listing expected risk areas; compare project objectives to risk items and identify manageable risks.

Risk Avoidance and Mitigation plan Designing activities in such a way as to minimize risk exposure.

Risk Management Plan  Identify  specific work processes to respond to the eventuality that risk occur.

 

Most critically, risk management plans include a risk strategy. Broadly, there are four potential strategies, with numerous variations. Projects may choose to:
 

Accept risk; simply take the chance that th e negative impact will be incurred
Avoid risk; changing plans in order to prevent the problem from arising
Mitigate risk; lessening its impact through intermediate steps
Transfer risk; outsource risk to a capable third party that can manage the outcome


During Project Execution and Control  risk management takes the form of monitoring and controlling risks.

Leadership vs. Management

* Managers manage. They get things done. Management is a function that is used to establish budgets, develop plans and schedules, and make sure that everything is moving along the way it is supposed to.
* Leaders lead. They can get people and entire organizations to change. They have a relationship with the people they lead, and those people follow them.

 

&quot;Managers do things right, while leaders do the right thing.”   -- Richard Pascale

“For any quality initiative to take hold, senior management must be involved and act as a role model. This involvement cannot be delegated.”   Daniel. F. Predpall

“Leaders stand out by being different. They question assumptions and are suspicious of tradition. They seek out the truth and make decisions based on fact, not prejudice. They have a preference for innovation.”   John Fenton

“Leaders must let vision, strategies, goals, and values be the guide-post for action and behavior rather than attempting to control others.”   Daniel. F. Predpall

“Leaders are observant and sensitive people. They know their team and develop mutual confidence within it.” - John Fenton

      <text xml:space="preserve">Evaluation of the  Employee Performance is an essential component of  the management  the project and programme teams.   In order to successfully meet the needs of a programme/project, it is important to have a high-performing Project Team made up of individuals who are both technically skilled and motivated to contribute to the project’s outcome. One of the many responsibilities of a Project Manager is to enhance the ability of each Project Team member to contribute to the project, while also fostering individual growth and accomplishment. At the same time, each individual must be encouraged to share ideas and work with others toward a common goal.
 
Although team performance (as in with project performance) requires more than an addition of individual performances, still the competence, the commitment and the integrity of the individual team members constitute the basic asset upon which team work is established.  Through the evaluation of the performance of the individual team embers the programme/project manager will get the information she needs in order to Ensure that the team has adequate knowledge, Establish a Positive Team Environment and a Healthy Communication Climate, Work Properly and Ensure Accountability  (thereby fulfilling the basic requirement for an employee empowering organization).

#quality or quantity of outputs, 
#work behavior (such as punctuality) 
#job-related attributes (such as cooperation and initiative).

After conducting employee performace reviews managers should: 

*provide feedback to employees about how well they have performed on established goals. 
*provide feedback to employees about areas in which the subordinate is weak or could do better. 
*take corrective action to address problems with employees performing at or below the minimum expectations. 
*reward superior performers to encourage their continued excellence.&lt;br&gt;

Development Cooperation Handbook/How do we manage the human resources of programmes and projects?/Manage the Project Team


In order to successfully meet the needs of a programme/project, it is important to have a high-performing Project Team made up of individuals who are both technically skilled and motivated to contribute to the project’s outcome. One of the many responsibilities of a Project Manager is to enhance the ability of each Project Team member to contribute to the project, while also fostering individual growth and accomplishment. At the same time, each individual must be encouraged to share ideas and work with others toward a common goal. 
Through the evaluation of the performance the manager will get the information she needs in order to Ensure that the team has adequate knowledge, Establish a Positive Team Environment and a Healthy Communication Climate, Work Properly and Ensure Accountability  (thereby fulfilling the basic requirement for an employee empowering organization).
 
Managing of the project team includes appraisal of employee performance and project performance!  The performace reports give the basis for managerial decisions on how to mange the project team. So there is a reiforcing cycle between performance appraisal and performance management of the same nature (but at a different level) of the relationship between execution and evaluation of project (see the cycle approach)

The Project Manager, then, must be a leader, communicator, negotiator, influencer, and problem solver! The level of skills and competencies to successfully fill these roles helps distinguish good Project Managers from great ones.

==Preamble==

It has become a ritual for Americans to spend the evening of presidential elections gathered in front of their televisions, or more recently, their computer screens, to follow the voting returns as they are announced state by state. Election Night 2000 began like any other since the late 1960s, when the television networks began using exit polls of voters taken as they leave the polling place to predict the winner. Election Night coverage is driven by anchors making projections about which candidate will win each state’s electoral votes. Typically, news organizations have a good sense of who will be the next president of the United States based on exit polls by late afternoon, although they hold off on making a prediction until later in the evening.Robert S. Erikson and Kent L. Tedin, American Public Opinion, 8th ed. (New York: Longman, 2011).

The 2000 presidential election was the closest in many decades. There was much uncertainty about whether Republican George W. Bush or Democrat Al Gore would emerge victorious. As Election Night unfolded, it became clear that the outcome would be decided by Florida’s twenty-five electoral votes.James W. Ceaser and Andrew E. Busch, The Perfect Tie (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001).

Network and cable news anchors discussed the closeness of the election and told the public to anticipate a long and interesting evening—a statement that proved prescient. By 8 p.m., exit polls indicated that Al Gore was leading the state of Florida, prompting television news organizations to speculate that Gore would be headed to the White House. CBS News anchor Dan Rather observed on air, “Now, remember, Florida is the state where Jeb Bush, the brother of George Bush, is the governor, and you can bet that Governor Bush will be madder than a rained-on rooster that his brother, the governor, wasn’t able to carry this state for him.”Dan Rather, CBS Evening News, Election Night Coverage, November 7, 2000, 8:15 p.m.

Three hours later, the networks began to rescind the call of Florida for Gore when it became evident that data from exit polls conflicted with actual returns from voting precincts. Network anchors reported that Florida’s electoral votes were still up for grabs until Fox News called Florida for Bush at 2:16 a.m.; ABC, CBS, and NBC quickly followed suit. With the media’s proclamation of Bush as the winner, Gore phoned Bush and conceded the election. Gore then departed from his hotel suite in Nashville to make his concession speech in front of his supporters. While Gore was en route, the press once again changed their position, stating that the election was too close to call. Gore returned to his hotel, as the media’s Election Night prediction of a Bush victory lasted all of ninety minutes.

Television news was not the only media source to prematurely call the election. Print newspapers, including the New York Post, the Miami Herald, and the San Francisco Chronicle, ran headlines declaring Bush the winner. The New York Times released 100,000 newspapers stating that Bush “appears to have won.” For an hour, the New York Times website proclaimed, “Bush Captures the White House.”Diana Owen, “Media Mayhem,” in Overtime!, ed. Larry J. Sabato (New York: Longman, 2002), 123–56.

The 2000 election was not decided on Election Night—November 7. Instead, a recount of the votes in Florida was undertaken in an attempt to determine the winner. The recount was halted by the US Supreme Court on December 12, 2000, and George W. Bush was sworn in as president on January 20, 2001.

The Election Night 2000 media debacle illustrates a number of points relevant to this chapter. Polling is an integral element of American politics. Polls shape the way that news organizations frame their stories and convey information to the public. In fact, many news organizations have in-house polling operations or collaborate with polling firms to have public opinion data constantly available. Poll results allow the media to convey information to the public in a concise and authoritative manner. Polls can provide guidance to decision makers about election outcomes and policy debates. However, poll results are not always accurate, as was the case with the exit polls in the 2000 presidential election, and they can misrepresent public sentiment. Therefore, it is important for people to be savvy consumers of opinion polls.

==What Is Public Opinion?==

Public opinion is one of the most frequently evoked terms in American politics. At the most basic level, public opinionPeople’s collective preferences on matters related to government and politics. represents people’s collective preferences on matters related to government and politics. However, public opinion is a complex phenomenon, and scholars have developed a variety of interpretations of what public opinion means. One perspective holds that individual opinions matter; therefore, the opinions of the majority should be weighed more heavily than opinions of the minority when leaders make decisions. A contrasting view maintains that public opinion is controlled by organized groups, government leaders, and media elites. The opinions of those in positions of power or who have access to those in power carry the most weight.

Public opinion is often made concrete through questions asked on polls. Politicians routinely cite public opinion polls to justify their support of or opposition to public policies. Candidates use public opinion strategically to establish themselves as front-runners or underdogs in campaigns. Interest groups and political parties use public opinion polls to promote their causes. The mass media incorporate reports of public opinion into news story about government and politics.

===Defining Public Opinion===

What exactly is public opinion? Scholars do not agree on a single definition of public opinion. The concept means different things depending on how one defines “the public” and assumptions about whose opinion should or does count the most—individuals, groups, or elites.

Most simply, the public can be thought of as people who share something in common, such as a connection to a government and a society that is confronted by particular issues that form the bases of public policies. Not all people have the same connection to issues. Some people are part of the attentive publicPeople who pay close attention to government and politics in general. who pay close attention to government and politics in general. Other individuals are members of issue publicsPeople who focus on particular public policy debates and ignore other issues. who focus on particular public policy debates, such as abortion or defense spending, and ignore others.[1]
 
They may focus on a policy that has personal relevance; a health-care activist, for example, may have a close relative or friend who suffers from a prolonged medical problem. Some members of the public have little interest in politics or issues, and their interests may not be represented.

An opinion is the position—favorable, unfavorable, neutral, or undecided—people take on a particular issue, policy, action, or leader. Opinions are not facts; they are expressions of people’s feelings about a specific political object. Pollsters seeking people’s opinions often say to respondents as they administer a survey, “there are expressions of people’s feelings about a specific political object. Pollsters seeking people’s opinions often say to respondents as they administer a survey, “there are no right or wrong answers; it’s your thoughts that count.” Opinions are related to but not the same as attitudes, or persistent, general orientations toward people, groups, or institutions. Attitudes often shape opinions. For example, people who hold attitudes strongly in favor of racial equality support public policies designed to limit discrimination in housing and employment.

Public opinion can be defined most generically as the sum of many individual opinions. More specific notions of public opinion place greater weight on individual, majority, group, or elite opinion when considering policy decisions.

===Equality of Individual Opinions===

Public opinion can be viewed as the collection of individual opinions, where all opinions deserve equal treatment regardless of whether the individuals expressing them are knowledgeable about an issue or not. Thus, public opinion is the aggregation of preferences of people from all segments of society. The use of public opinion polls to gauge what people are thinking underlies this view.[2]
 
By asking questions of a sample of people who are representative of the US population, pollsters contend they can assess the American public’s mood.[3]
 
People who favor this perspective on public opinion believe that government officials should take into account both majority and minority views when making policy.

===Majority Opinion===

Another perspective maintains that public opinion is the opinion held by the most people on an issue. In a democracy, the opinions of the majority are the ones that should count the most and should guide government leaders’ decision making. The opinions of the minority are less important than those of the majority. This view of public opinion is consistent with the idea of popular election in that every citizen is entitled to an opinion—in essence a vote—on a particular issue, policy, or leader. In the end, the position that is taken by the most people—in other words, the position that receives the most votes—is the one that should be adopted by policymakers.

Rarely, if ever, does the public hold a single unified opinion. There is often significant disagreement in the public’s preferences, and clear majority opinions do not emerge. This situation poses a challenge for leaders looking to translate these preferences into policies. In 2005, Congress was wrestling with the issue of providing funding for stem cell research to seek new medical cures. Opinion polls indicated that a majority of the public (56 percent) favored stem cell research. However, views differed markedly among particular groups who formed important political constituencies for members. White evangelical Protestants opposed stem cell research (58 percent), arguing the need to protect human embryos, while mainline Protestants (69 percent) and Catholics supported research (63 percent).[4]

===Public Debate among Groups===

Some scholars contend that public opinion emerges from public debate among groups rather than from individual opinions.[5]
 
Political parties, interest groups, trade associations, nonprofit organizations, trade unions, and corporations will articulate positions and front public discussion of issues in which they have a stake. Groups representing opposing viewpoints often find themselves in a position to define social problems. While individuals often find it difficult to make their views known and have them taken seriously, organized groups have the resources, such as lobbyists and funding to administer polls and pay for advertising, as well as the ability to attract the attention of policymakers and the mass media. Social media have made it easier for groups without  significant resources to publicize their opinions by using Facebook groups and other platforms.

Groups work hard to frame issue debates to their advantage. They often will gauge public preferences and use this information when devising media tactics to gain support for their positions.[6]
 
Opposing groups will present competing public opinion poll data in an effort to influence decision makers and the press. In 1997, the United States’ participation in a summit in Kyoto, Japan, where nations signed a climate-control treaty, sparked a barrage of media stories on the issue of global warming and the potential for deadly gasses to induce climate change. Most Americans believed then that global warming existed and that steps should be taken to combat the problem.[7]
 
Groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, and the Sierra Club who favor government-imposed regulations on fossil-fuel companies and automobile manufacturers to curb pollution cited opinion poll data showing that over 70 percent of the public agreed with these actions. Organizations representing industry interests, such as the now-defunct Global Climate Coalition, used opinion polls indicating that the public was reluctant to sacrifice jobs or curb their personal energy use to stop global warming.[8]
 
The debate in the media among competing groups influenced public opinion over the following decade. There was a massive shift in opinion, as only 52 percent believed that global warming was a problem in 2010.[9]
 
===Elite Opinion===

Politicians, pollsters, policy specialists, activists, and journalists have assumed the position of opinion leaders who shape, create, and interpret public opinion. These political elites are devoted to following public affairs—it’s their job.[10]
 
Noted journalist and social commentator Walter Lippmann observed that average people have neither the time nor the inclination to handle the impossible task of keeping up with the myriad issues that confront the nation. They do not have the opportunity to directly experience most political events and must rely on second-hand accounts conveyed by elites primarily through mass media. In Lippmann’s view, public opinion is best managed by specialists who have the knowledge and capabilities to promote policies. Thus, elite opinion, and not the views of average citizens, should count the most.

The mass media rely heavily on the opinions of government elites, especially when covering foreign policy and domestic issues, such as the economy and employment. The breadth of news coverage about foreign affairs is constrained to reflect the range of viewpoints expressed by officials such as members of Congress who are debating the issues. The voices of average Americans are much less prominent in news coverage.[11]
 
As political scientist V. O. Key stated, “The voice of the people is but an echo.”[12]

Elite opinion is increasingly articulated by punditsPeople who offer their opinion or commentary on political issues through the media. who offer their opinion or commentary on political issues. College professors, business and labor leaders, lobbyists, public relations representatives, and pollsters are typical pundits who provide expert opinion. Some pundits represent distinctly partisan or ideological viewpoints and use public opinion data selectively to support these positions. Pundits can establish their credentials as experts on governmental affairs and politics through their frequent media appearances as “talking heads” on cable television programs such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News.

==Democracy and Public Opinion==

Political scientist Harold Lasswell once noted, “The open interplay of opinion and policy is the distinguishing mark of popular rule.”[13]
 
Public opinion plays a number of important roles in a representative democracy. Leaders can take public opinion into account when making laws and formulating policy. Public opinion can act as a check on leadership, as the members of the public can express their dissatisfaction with politicians who refuse to take their opinions into account and vote them out of office.

===Public Opinion and Public Policy===

One purpose of public opinion in a democracy is to inform public policymaking. Opinion polls provide a mechanism for succinctly presenting the views of the mass public to government leaders who are making decisions that will affect society. Leaders often monitor the public pulse when making policy decisions, especially when they face an election campaign.

Perspectives about the relationship of public opinion to policymaking differ vastly. On the one hand, scholars and political practitioners believe that public policy should be guided by public opinion so that the will of the people is respected. Public opinion polls are essential to ensuring democratic governance. Political scientist Sidney Verba supports this view: “Surveys produce just what democracy is supposed to produce—equal representation of all citizens. The sample survey is rigorously egalitarian; it is designed so that each citizen has an equal chance to participate and an equal voice when participating.”[14]

From this perspective, members of Congress, state legislators, and local officials should pay close attention to the public’s views when making laws.

Others disagree with the notion that leaders should pay close attention to public opinion when making decisions. They point out that many members of the public are uniformed about issues, and the opinions they record on polls are not carefully reasoned. Journalist and scholar Walter Lippmann noted that governing by popularity is not always best. Instead, public policy should be grounded in sound principles supported by experts; decision making should not simply be the result of popular will. This view is consistent with the belief that the country is being run by pollsters and their followers and not by leaders with integrity and principle. As an editorial in the Wall Street Journal lamented, “Spend too much time following polls and you simply forget how to lead, especially when it matters.”[15]

Some scholars take issue with Verba’s assessment of the egalitarian nature of polls in democracy and argue that minority opinion is not given sufficient weight. Certain people, such as individuals with few economic resources, have a difficult time getting their views recognized. Pollsters may not reach these people because they do not have regular telephone or Internet service, or they do not have the time or inclination to answer questionnaires.

===Public Judgement===

Public opinion, especially as measured by polls, is a quick take on the public pulse. It often does not require that members of the public have much knowledge about politicians, government, or policies; they merely must be willing to state whatever views pop into their heads. Public opinion polls often deal with issues and abstract ideas that people have not thought much about.

Public judgment, in contrast, is a special type of public opinion where people carefully consider the important issues of the day, contemplate the range of viewpoints, and weigh the consequences of policy prescriptions. Rather than stating positions off the top of their heads, public judgment requires people to be knowledgeable about an issue and debate the merits of policies before arriving at an informed opinion. For example, public opinion polls conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2011 indicate that the public favors tougher immigration laws and better enforcement of border security. However, when people exercise public judgment and consider the consequences of immigration policy, such as the moral issues related to the welfare of children of illegal immigrants, they support more generous policies.[16]
 
Public judgment is not easily achieved, but it offers an important counterbalance to the domination of elite opinion in the policy sphere.

===Deliberative Polling===

Deliberative polling is a technique that provides members of the public with the opportunity to think carefully about issues and their relationship to public policy. It attempts to deal with the fact that many people know little about issues because they lack the time to acquire information. Deliberative polling was pioneered in 1988 and has been used around the world to gauge opinion. The Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University applies and studies the use of deliberative polling.

A random, representative sample of people is first polled about their positions on targeted issues. They are then brought together for a few days to discuss a particular issue in detail. The participants are provided with briefing materials, engage in a dialogue with experts on specific topics, and discuss their views in small groups led by trained moderators. The deliberations are shared with the general public through television broadcasts. The participants are polled again after they have deliberated to determine if their opinions have changed. Scholars believe that deliberative polls represent the opinions the public would hold on issues if they had the opportunity to exercise public judgment and carefully consider their options. After deliberating on an issue, members of the public frequently shift positions.[17]
 
For example, people participating in a deliberative polling experiment in Texas shifted their views on the use of wind power from 54 percent to 84 percent in favor. As a result, political leaders heeded the views of Texas’s population, and the state went from last to first in the use of wind power.[18]

Political scientist James Fishkin, who pioneered deliberative polling, observes, “The Public is very smart if you give it a chance. If people think their voice actually matters, they’ll do the hard work, really study their briefing books, ask the experts smart questions and then make tough decisions.”

==Polling the Public==

Public opinion polling has a long history in the United States. Polls are ubiquitous in American political life. In 2007, there were nearly 5,500 polling organizations in the United States, an increase of over 1,500 organizations in ten years.[19]
 
Every day the public is polled about topics ranging from their views about taxes and the federal budget, their opinions about the environment and global warming, and whether or not a principal has the right to prevent students from bringing their lunches to school.

Polls vary greatly in terms of their quality, content, and purpose. Reliable public opinion data are gathered by reputable commercial polling organizations, nonpartisan think tanks, academic institutions, government agencies, and news organizations. Misleading information about public opinion can result from quick polls that do not employ appropriate data-gathering techniques.

===History of Opinion Polling===

Public opinion polls date back to the early days of the American republic. From the outset, polls were linked closely with newspapers. The Harrisburg Pennsylvanian conducted the first informal “straw pollAn informal poll, often used to gauge opinions about candidates, that is administered haphazardly and without attention to proper sampling methods.” in 1824 that incorrectly predicted Andrew Jackson as the winner over John Quincy Adams in the presidential election.[20]

Early straw polls were administered haphazardly and without concern for drawing a proper sample, often right after people had cast their ballots in elections or even when they were checking into a hotel. They were notoriously inaccurate, yet they became a popular feature of newspapers and magazines, which treated poll data as a source of news much like today.

Straw polls were sponsored by publishers as a gimmick to attract readers who would fill out mail-in ballots that included subscription offers. Over eighty straw polls were conducted during the 1924 presidential election, six of which were national polls. Newspapers also conducted polls on pressing issues of the day, such as whether or not people favored Prohibition, the constitutional ban on alcohol. Coverage of these polls in print publications generated thousands of column inches.[21]

By the 1920s, market researchers had begun to use scientific polls that employed samples representative of the population to ascertain consumer product preferences. They used polls to discover everything from what kinds of magazine stories readers enjoyed most to what automobiles people preferred.[22]
 
Commercial pollsters applied market research techniques to determine what candidates voters favored, how satisfied the public was with the way the president was doing his job, and how people felt about the pressing issues of the day.

Despite these advances, magazines and newspapers continued to use unscientific straw polls, which were less expensive to administer and contributed to the profitability of the publication. The problems associated with straw polls came to a head in the 1936 presidential election when the Literary Digest, a popular magazine with a large circulation, incorrectly predicted the presidential election outcome, prompting the public to lose faith in polls. For a time after the Literary Digest debacle, newspapers shied away from highlighting polls in their coverage.

The Literary Digest Poll

In polling, more subjects does not necessarily yield better results. This lesson was learned all too well by the Literary Digest in 1936. Founded in 1890, the Literary Digest was a venerable general interest magazine that catered to an educated, well-off clientele. In 1916, the magazine initiated a presidential election poll that became a popular feature. Subscribers mailed in sample ballots indicating their preference in the election. The poll correctly predicted that Woodrow Wilson would be the winner, and the magazine’s poll went on to successfully call the next four elections. Newspapers gave substantial coverage to the poll, which drove up the magazine’s readership. In 1932, James A. Farley, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was widely quoted as saying, “Any sane person cannot escape the implication of such a gigantic sampling of popular opinion as is embraced in the Literary Digest straw vote.… It is a Poll fairly and correctly conducted.”

The magazine set out to launch its most ambitious poll ever in 1936. Over 10 million postcards were mailed to Literary Digest subscribers, people on automobile registration lists, and names in telephone directories, of which 2.4 million were returned. The Literary Digest issued its predictions in an article boasting that the figures represented the opinions of “more than one in every five voters polled in our country” scattered throughout the forty-eight states. The results indicated that Republican candidate Alfred Landon would defeat Franklin Roosevelt, receive 57 percent of the popular vote, and carry thirty-two states in the Electoral College. Roosevelt won by a landslide, commanding 61 percent of the popular vote and winning in all but two states.

While the magazine made no claims of infallibility, its methodology was heavily flawed. The sample was biased toward Republican-leaning voters who could afford telephone service, cars, and magazine subscriptions. The volunteers who tabulated the results were not carefully trained, which introduced additional error into the calculations. The backlash from the errant results was monumental. The Literary Digest went bankrupt, and the public’s faith in polls was shattered.
----
Commercial pollsters using scientific techniques correctly predicted that Roosevelt would defeat Landon in the 1936 election. These pollsters conduct polls for clients for a profit. The Gallup Poll administered personal interviews with a quota sampleA method of selecting survey participants that involves choosing subjects on the basis of their fitting into particular demographic categories, such as sex and age groups. of people who fit into particular demographic categories, such as sex and age groups. Gallup correctly predicted the winners of the 1940 and 1944 presidential contests. However, during the 1948 election, three major pollsters—Gallup, Roper, and Crossley all incorrectly predicted that Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey would defeat Democratic candidate Harry Truman. The quota sampling method used by these pollsters was problematic and was replaced by probability samplingA method of selecting survey participants at random., in which subjects are randomly selected to take part in a poll.[23]

Dewey Defeats Truman

The 1948 presidential election did not start off well for Democratic candidate Harry S. Truman. As vice president, Truman was sworn in as president when Franklin Roosevelt died less than three months into his fourth term. Truman was forced to deal with a variety of controversial issues, including the decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which he believed would end World War II in the Pacific. Newspapers labeled Truman a “little man,” a tag that resonated with the public who contrasted him unfavorably to the larger-than-life Roosevelt.

The Democrats were highly factionalized when they met in Philadelphia for their national nominating convention. They attempted unsuccessfully to recruit popular war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower to be their candidate. When the convention adopted a strong civil rights platform, Southern delegations bolted and nominated their own candidate, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Liberals who disapproved of Truman’s policies formed the Progressive Party and nominated Henry Wallace of Iowa as their candidate. In the end, Truman became the nominee with Senator Alben Barkeley of Kentucky as his running mate. The pair was faced with an unenthusiastic constituency.

In contrast, the Republican Party united behind Thomas E. Dewey, the popular governor of New York. Dewey had been the Republicans’ candidate in the 1944 presidential campaign, and had come close to Roosevelt in the popular vote. California Governor Earl Warren, future chief justice of the Supreme Court, was the vice presidential candidate.

Pollsters and the press anticipated that Dewey would win by a landslide. On September 9, 1948, nearly two months prior to the election, noted pollster Elmo Roper declared that there would be no more Roper Polls predicting the outcome: “My whole inclination is to predict the election of Thomas E. Dewey by a heavy margin and devote my time and efforts to other things.”[24]

Normally, incumbents such as President Truman run low-key campaigns, and challengers such as Governor Dewey work hard to win. Dewey campaigned like a front-runner, remaining aloof and dignified while avoiding discussions of controversial issues. Roles were reversed in the 1948 presidential campaign. Truman, realizing he had nothing to lose, launched an aggressive “Whistle Stop” campaign. Traveling in a special Pullman railroad car nicknamed the Ferdinand Magellan, after the explorer who circumnavigated the world, Truman covered 32,000 miles and gave 355 rousing speeches. At each stop, Truman would introduce his family to the crowd, answer questions, and shake hands. As he fought his way through the campaign, he acquired the slogan “Give ‘em hell, Harry!”

Even as Truman’s campaign picked up steam and polls showed the gap between the candidates was closing, the press refused to concede that he could win. Newsweek polled fifty political journalists a month before the campaign, and all of them stated that Dewey would win. Truman had the support of only 15 percent of the nation’s newspapers.[25]
 
By Election Day, polls indicated that Truman might pull an upset, but journalists stuck to their story that Dewey would win by a landslide. Reports filtered in throughout Election Night that Truman was leading in the popular vote, but the press continued to report that he could not emerge victorious. The Chicago Tribune was so certain that Truman would lose, the headline of the early edition proclaimed “DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN.” The paper had already been delivered, and the Tribune dispatched employees to retrieve the papers from newsstands and homes, but many remained in the hands of readers. Traveling by train from his home state of Missouri to Washington, DC, Truman made a brief stop in St. Louis, where he was presented with one of the papers bearing the infamous headline. Truman held up the paper and quipped, “This is for the books.”[26]
----

Survey research organizations associated with academic institutions emerged in the 1940s with the establishment of the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago and the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Michigan. These organizations and others like them, such as the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut, field and archive detailed surveys that provide researchers with a wealth of data to use in studies to gain a deeper understanding of the public’s political attitudes and behavior. Nonpartisan survey research organizations, such as the Pew Research Center and the Field Poll in California, provide data to news organizations and academics. Commercial pollsters, including Gallup and IBOPE Zogby International, provide polling services to clients and also share their data with the press, scholars, and the public through their websites.

===Types of Polls===

The amount of polling data available today from commercial polling firms, academic survey research organizations, campaign organizations, trade associations, interest groups, media outlets, and online sources is almost overwhelming. There are great variations in the type and quality of polling data. A public opinion survey fielded by a reputable organization using proper social scientific techniques differs greatly from a quick poll consisting of one or two questions administered online to whoever is willing to take it.

Questionnaires used to measure public opinion include a variety of question types. Closed-ended questions provide respondents with a fixed number of options about a topic from which they can choose the one that best fits their position. provide respondents with a fixed number of options about a topic from which they can choose the one that best fits their position. A closed-ended question frequently asked to gauge people’s feelings about the direction in which the country is headed is “Generally speaking, would you say things in this country are heading in the right direction, or are they off on the wrong track?” Respondents must select one of the options: the right direction or the wrong track. Closed-ended questions are easier and less time-consuming to analyze, although they limit the respondent’s ability to express their opinions to the choices offered by the researcher. Open-ended questions do not provide fixed options but instead allow respondents to reply to a question in their own words. This type of question elicits more information from respondents and can be useful in gaining insight into sensitive topics. The drawbacks of open-ended questions are that people may not want to take the time to answer them and they are more time-consuming for pollsters to analyze. An open-ended question about the direction in which the country is headed would ask people to express their own views in response to the question “How do you think things are going in this country?”

Most polls provide snapshots of people’s opinions at a particular point in time. Other polls track opinions over time in order to determine if people’s views remain stable or change. In rare cases, studies have tracked the opinions of the same groups of people over years, even decades. The views of the women who attended Bennington College in the 1930s were tracked through the 1980s. The study revealed that the college experience changed some of the women’s attitudes and that the views acquired in college remained stable over time.[27]

===Polls and Surveys===

The terms “poll” and “survey” often are used interchangeably, yet there are distinctions between them. A public opinion poll is typically conducted by a commercial organization working for a profit. A poll generally consists of a short questionnaire administered over a brief period of time to a sample of between six hundred and fifteen hundred people. A survey most often is conducted by academic or government researchers. Surveys consist of longer questionnaires designed to examine the foundations and consequences of opinions in some detail. Researchers may administer the survey to thousands of subjects interviewed over an extended period of time.[28]

Scientific polls and surveys are considered to be the gold standard for measuring public opinion. They adhere to established procedures that help ensure the accuracy of their results, which includes using proper techniques for drawing a sample and designing questions. Scientific polls and surveys are administered to a sample of people who are representative of a larger population. The sample is drawn using probability sampling, meaning that each person in the population has a chance of being included in the sample. It is possible to get an accurate accounting of public opinion with a relatively small sample. A representative sample of twelve hundred people can accurately reflect the public opinion of the entire population of the United States. On the other hand, large samples that are not representative may not reflect public opinion accurately at all. Question wording is another important consideration when measuring public opinion. Questions need to be clearly stated, and they should not lead the respondent to choose one answer over another. A poorly worded question can be misunderstood by the respondent and ultimately can misrepresent the public’s viewpoints. Answer options that do not provide the public with clear alternatives also are problematic.

There are many ways in which polls and surveys can be administered, including through face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, mail questionnaires, and online questionnaires. Each of these methods has pros and cons. Face-to-face interviews are advantageous for administering long, complicated surveys, yet they are costly and subjects may be reluctant to talk to a stranger about their opinions. Telephone interviews are relatively easy to administer, but getting a representative sample has become more difficult as many polling organizations rely on landline telephone directories to recruit respondents, and people increasingly are relying on cell phones. Young people are not well represented in landline polls.[29]
 
Mail questionnaires are a low-cost method that allows subjects privacy when answering questions, which can yield more accurate results. However, mail surveys often suffer from low response rate, as people simply opt out because the questionnaire is self-administered.[30]

Online polls have become a more popular option in recent years as the majority of the public has access to the Internet. According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 79 percent of American adults were online in May 2010. Studies indicate that online polls are no less reliable than other forms of polling. They have the advantage of being cost-effective, and allowing respondents privacy when answering questions. Online polls also provide opportunities for innovation, such as getting reactions to video clips of campaign ads. The limitation of online polls is that it is more difficult to get a representative sample using the 

Internet than with some traditional methods, because not all of the public is online. Also, online surveys are self-administered, and people can drop out before they are completed, especially if the questionnaire is lengthy.[31]

===Exit Polls===

Exit polls are face-to-face interviews with voters taken as they leave the voting booth to determine their candidate preference in the election and their positions on issues. They are fielded in a small number of voting precincts with states with the goal of acquiring representative data. They are used to predict the outcomes of elections and to determine the characteristics of voters who supported particular candidates. Exit poll data can reveal, for example, who female, Latino, Republican voters favored in an election campaign.

Exit polls are a major component of the media’s Election Night coverage. Until 1992, each news network had its own in-house exit polling operation. To cut costs, an exit poll consortium, Voter News Service (VNS), was formed to provide data to all the major networks. VNS released the exit poll data that prompted the networks to prematurely declare the results of the 2000 presidential election, and the organization subsequently was disbanded. Exit poll data in the 2008 presidential election and 2010 midterm elections were provided to major television news organizations and the Associated Press by the National Election Exit Polls conducted by Edison Research.

News organizations use exit polls to declare a winner, sometimes when few of the actual returns from the voting precincts have been recorded. This practice has raised concerns, especially since the major television networks all rely on exit poll data from the same source—the National Election Exit Poll. While exit polls are often accurate, if the sample of voters is unrepresentative of the population, the survey questions are poorly written, or interviewers are not trained to properly administer the poll, the results can be wrong, as was the case in the 2000 presidential election.

Some scholars allege that media reports of exit polls can depress election turnout. When the media declare the winner in a presidential election on the basis of exit polls before the voting booths have closed across the country, people who have not yet voted may decide not turn out. Network television newscasts declared Ronald Reagan the winner of the 1980 presidential election on the basis of exit polls hours before the voting booths had closed on the West Coast. A controversy ensued around the allegation that West Coast voters were discouraged from casting a ballot because they felt their vote was irrelevant. The networks agreed voluntarily to refrain from declaring a winner in elections until after all the polls have closed nationwide—an agreement that has not always been followed.

===Quick Polls===

A quick poll usually consists of one or two questions that are posted to a website, blog, discussion board, social media platform, or podcast. Quick polls have become standard features of websites of news organizations, political leaders, issue advocacy groups, political parties, candidates, bloggers, and even average citizens. They can be distributed through website sidebars, e-mail links, Facebook postings, and Twitter feeds. There are many platforms available that make it easy for just about anyone to field a quick poll. Quick polls also can be administered through robo-polling-administering automated polls by phone using a recorded voice to ask the question and requiring respondents to answer by pressing the touch pad on their telephone.[32]

Quick polls do not conform to the established protocols for conducting scientific polls, and they generally are not reliable indicators of public opinion. They often use an unscientific convenience sample of people who may see the poll posted online or have the link sent to them through e-mail. Most respondents to quick polls are self-selected, and they may have a strong interest in the topic. Often it is possible for people to register their views more than once, which can bias the outcome of the poll. Quick polls may generate many responses, but the results can be wildly inaccurate. In addition, quick poll questions can be designed in a way that elicits a particular response that is then used to promote a particular position. For example, a quick poll might seek to find support for bike lanes in cities by stating, “Seven out of ten Americans favor designating bike lanes in major cities. Do you favor or oppose designating bike lanes in your city?”

Quick polls can be a fun way to generate interest in political affairs. People can express their views easily, and they often get immediate feedback about where they stand compared to others. The results of quick polls often are revealed in visually appealing graphics. Reporters and bloggers use the results of quick polls to generate story lines and supplement the text of their pieces. However, quick polls can be misused when the results are interpreted as if they truly reflect public opinion rather than the views of the people who chose to take them.

===Push Polls===

A push poll is a marketing technique used by political campaigns and issue advocacy groups to influence the opinions of respondents. Despite their name, push polls are not legitimate public opinion polls. They are a form of advertising masquerading in the form of an opinion survey. No one collects or analyzes data from a push poll. However, push polls can influence vote choice in campaigns by incorporating negative attacks on a candidate into the questions asked or associating a candidate with a particular issue position which may or may not be accurate.

Push polls were used against Republican candidate John McCain during the 2000 presidential primary. Voters in South Carolina were asked questions like “Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?” Push polls were used to target Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign. Voters in Ohio received phone calls from Opinion Access Corporation asking if they would be more or less likely to vote for Barack Obama if they knew that he had voted to let convicted child sex offenders out early.[33]
 
While these allegations were untrue or taken out of context, the information was spread to voters. Push polls have been outlawed in certain states and they have been condemned by the American Association of Public Opinion Researchers (AAPOR), the organization that upholds standards for polling and survey research.

===Other Ways of Measuring Public Opinion===

There are a variety of ways of measuring public opinion aside from polls. The different sides of an argument expressed in public debates or at a community meeting reflect public opinion. The positions taken in letters to the editor, blog and social media posts, and the comments in response to news stories and editorials are all indicators of public sentiment. The commentary that people post in response to news stories can provide a rich source of information about public opinion, especially when people take the issue seriously and are respectful when expressing their views. This commentary also can be careless and vitriolic, as people resort to personal attacks or post quick reactions to complex issues.

Focus groups have been used for over eighty years to ascertain people’s attitudes, beliefs, and opinions about politics within a group setting. A facilitator asks questions of a group of between eight and twelve people who can engage in a conversation about the topic. Focus groups not only are useful for gaining in-depth insights into what individuals think but also aid in understanding the group dynamics behind public opinion. Focus groups can reveal when people feel comfortable expressing their beliefs, when they will confront others about their views, when they will withdraw from a discussion, and when they are influenced by the opinions of others.[34]

Focus groups have been used to allow college students to reveal their views about government and their role in a democratic polity. Talking with students in a group setting, researchers discovered that young people are more interested and engaged in politics than survey-based studies indicate, and that they are thinking creatively about ways to become involved, especially using social media.[35]
 
Focus groups are used extensively in election campaigns to determine what voters are thinking about and which candidates they prefer.

'''Ottawa Personal Decision Guide'''
For People Facing Tough Health or Social Decisions You will be guided through four steps:
&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;



'''Clarify your decision.'''
 What decision do you face? 
What is your reason for making this decision? 
When do you need to make a choice?
How far along are you with making a choice?
        -Not yet thought about the options 
        -Thinking about the options
        -Close to making a choice 
        -Already made a choice

'''Explore your decision'''
 Knowledge &lt;gallery&gt;
File:Kn-ptda.png|
&lt;/gallery&gt;
List the options and main benefits and risks you already know.
'''Values''' &lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;

Use stars  to show how much each benefit and risk matters to you. 5 stars means that it matters “a lot”. No stars means “not at all”.

'''Certainty''' &lt;gallery&gt;
File:Q-ptda.png|
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Consider the option with the benefits that matter most to you and are most likely to happen. Avoid the options with the risks that matter most to you.

|-
! !!'''Reasons to Choose this Option (Benefits / Advantages / Pros)''' !! '''How much it matters Use 0 to 5 stars''' !! '''Reasons to Avoid this Option (Risks / Disadvantages / Cons)'''!!''' How much it matters Use 0 to 5stars'''

| Option #1  ||               ||                ||               ||               
|-
| Option #2 ||                ||               ||                ||               
|-
|Option #3 ||                ||                ||                ||               
|}


'''Which option do you prefer?'''  Option #1  Option #2  Option #3   Unsure

'''Support'''' &lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;
Who else is involved?
Which option do they prefer?
Is this person pressuring you?  Yes No
How can they support you?

What role do you prefer in making the choice?
          -Share the decision with
          -Decide myself after hearing views of
          -Someone else decides.
    Who?

The existence of the paths in a graph and its dual with the following properties plays an important role in the connection between global and local properties of the graph:  Two sets of paths between two subsets of boundary nodes in the graph and its dual are '''[[Hamiltonian]]''' if the paths go through every interior point of the graph and its dual.

| common_name =Meadow Jumping Mouse
| latin_name =zapus hudsonius
| image =Zapus hudsonius.jpg|thumb|Zapus hudsonius
| image_caption = Meadow Jumping Mouse
| family = Dipodidae 


| size = Meadow Jumping Mice range in length from 180 to 240 mm. The hind feet are 28 to 35 mm long.
 Body weight typically depends on the time of year; they weigh more prior to hibernation,up to 35 g. During the summer, weights average between 16 and 19 g. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation Smithl |first1=J |year=1999 |title=Zapus Hudsonius |from= University of Michigan Online Museum of Zoology |issue=189 |pages=283-294. |url= http://www.animaldiversity.umm2.umich.edu/accounts/zapus_hudsonius/ |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;



| description =Meadow Jumping Mice are recognized by their extremely long tails, long hind feet, and slender build. Adults have a dorsal dark or olive brown band, which is paler in juveniles. The sides are a pale yellowish-brown, with black hairs lining the sides, and the underparts are white. The tail is sparsely haired, dark brown on top, and white on the bottom, and is longer than the body length. Meadow jumping mice are the only mammal with eighteen teeth. The upper jaw is characterized as having short, narrow, and longitudinally grooved incisors; small cheek teeth; and a small premoloar that generally precedes the molars. 
 
| similar = The Meadow Mouse is similar in appearance to the Woodland Jumping Mouse except they do not have a white-tipped tail and are typically duller in color.
 
| range =  This species is found throughout northern North America.They are found as far North as Alaska and as far south as New Mexico giving them the widest distribution of mice in the subfamily Zapodinae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Whittakerl |first1=J.O. |year=1972 |title=Zapus Hudsonius |periodical=Mammalian Species |issue=189 |pages=1-7 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-011-01-0001.pdf |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

| habitat = Meadow Jumping Mice live in various habitats that have some herbacious cover. They prefer moist grasslands and avoid heavily wooded areas. Grassy fields and thick vegetated areas bordering streams, ponds, or marshes generally support greater numbers of this species. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Whittakerl |first1=J.O. |year=1972 |title=Zapus Hudsonius |periodical=Mammalian Species |issue=189 |pages=1-7 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-011-01-0001.pdf |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| diet = Meadow Jumping Mice primarily eat seeds, but also feeds on fruit, insects, and berries.

| activity = Meadow Jumping Mice are solitary, but not aggressive toward others. They are generally nocturnal (although occasionally diurnal), and usually move in short hops of about 2.5 to 15 cm or by crawling along vole runways or in the grass. They are also great swimmers, diggers, and can climb. These mice are relatively nomadic, and may roam up to 1 km in search of moist habitat. They also hibernate during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1Hazardl |first1=E |year=1982 |title=Meadow Jumping Mouse |periodical=Mammals of Minnesota |pages=106-109.}}&lt;/ref&gt;



| reproduction = The breeding season of Meadow Jumping Mice occurs after hibernation in late April or May. Males emerge from hibernation slightly before the females and are reproductively active when the females emerge. Gestation is usually about 18 days, but may be longer for females who are already nursing a litter. Females typically have 2 to 3 litters in a year with an average of 5.3 young per litter.   Small and weighing about 0.8 g, the neonates are naked, pink, blind, clawless and deaf, but squeak audibly at birth. In the first week, their ears unfold, fur begins to cover their backs, and their claws appear. They begin crawling between one and two weeks, and by the third week they can hop, creep, and hear. Their incisors have erupted, and they have tawny coats. By the end of the fourth week, the young have adult pelage, and open eyes. Weaned, they become independent during the 4th week. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1Hazardl |first1=E |year=1982 |title=Meadow Jumping Mouse |periodical=Mammals of Minnesota |pages=106-109.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


| lifespan = &lt;1 year in the wild, or up to 5 years in captivity
| notes = The Meadow jumping mouse can jump up to 3 feet in length in its first jump which it then follows with a series of smaller jumps.

Oriya (ଓଡ଼ିଆ oṛiā), officially spelled Odia, is an Indian language, belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family. It is mainly spoken in the Indian states of Orissa and in parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Oriya is one of the many official languages in India; it is the official language of Orissa and the second official language of Jharkhand. Oriya is the predominant language of Orissa, where Oriya speakers comprise around 83.33% of the population according to census surveys.

==Preliminaries==
The examples of Oriya words, phrases, clauses and sentences used in this book are generally presented simultaneously in three written forms: one using the Oriya script, a transliterated version using Roman letters, and an English translation. 

The Oriya-to-Roman transliteration scheme is the one followed in the English Wikipedia and can be seen [[:w:Oriya_script#Romanization_reference|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oriya is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language family. It is thought to be directly descended from a Magadhi Prakrit similar to Ardha Magadhi, which was spoken in eastern India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early Jain texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Harvard Lecture&quot;&gt;The Harvard Lecture&lt;/ref&gt; Oriya appears to have had relatively little influence from Persian  and  Arabic, compared to other major North Indian languages.&lt;ref name=Kwinte/&gt;

==History==

The history of the Oriya language is divided into:

* Old Oriya (7th century-1200): The origin of the Oriya literature can be traced to &quot;Bauddha Gana O Doha&quot;, otherwise known as Charyapada&lt;ref name=Gopal&gt;Gopal Chandra Praharaj.''[http://cbioc.eas.asu.edu/cbioc/chitta/bhashakosha/Garbhagruha/Purnachandra%20Bhashakosha%20Vol%20I/Bhashakosha%20I-1,%20folio,%201-400.pdf Purnachandra bhasakosa]''. Vol I. p.25 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; written by the Buddhist Siddhas of Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;Banshidhar Mohanty. (1970) [http://oaob.nitrkl.ac.in/48/2/Odia_Sahityara_Itihasa-96.pdf Odia sahityara itihasa (Vol I). Friends Publishers. Cuttack]&lt;/ref&gt; The Oriya language begins to appear in inscriptions with Oriya scripts in temples, copper plates, palm-leaf manuscripts etc. Traces of Oriya words and expressions have been found in inscriptions dating from the 7th century AD. For example, the Oriya word କୁମ୍ଭାର /kumbha:rɔ/ ‘potter’ occurs in a copperplate inscription ‘belonging to a date not later than the 7th century AD’. Similarly, in inscriptions of 991 AD, Oriya words like ଭିତୁରୁ /bhituru/ ‘from inside’ and ପନ୍ଦର /pɔndɔrɔ/ ‘fifteen’ can be found. ‘An Oriya script|Oriya Passage’ also has been found in another inscription of about 715 AD.

* Early Middle Oriya (1200–1400): The earliest use of prose can be found in the Madala Panji or the Palm-leaf Chronicles of the Jagannatha temple at Puri, which date back to the 12th century.

* Middle Oriya (1400–1700): Mahabharat, Chandi Puran, Vilanka Ramayan of Shudramuni Sarala Das. Arjuna Das, a contemporary to Sarala Dasa, wrote Rama-Bibha, a significant long poem in Oriya. Towards the 16th century, five poets emerged, though there are hundreds year gap in between them. But they are known as Panchasakha's as they believed to same school of thought,  Utkaliya Vaishnavism. The poets are Balaram Das, Jagannath Das, Achyutananda Das, Ananta Das and Jasobanta Das.

* Late Middle Oriya (1700–1850): Usabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Das, the Rahasya-manjari of Deva-durlabha Dasa and the Rukmini-bibha of Kartikka Das were written. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote Haravali. Upendra Bhanja took a leading role in this period, his creations were Baidehisha Bilasa, Koti Brahmanda Sundari, Lavanyabati were proved landmark in Oriya Literature. Dinakrushna Das’s Rasokallola and Abhimanyu samanta Simhara’s Bidagdha Chintamani are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Kabi surya Baladeb Rath, Santha Kabi or Andha Muni Bhima Bhoi, Brajanath Badajena and Gopal Krushna Pattanaik.

* Modern Oriya (1850 till present day): The first Oriya printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolutions in Oriya literature and language.

===Ancient Form of Oriya Language in 2nd Century BC Rock edict King Ashoka===

The script in the edicts of Ashoka in 2nd century BC at Dhauli and Jaugada and the inscriptions of Kharavela in Hati Gumpha of Khandagiri give us the first glimpse of possible origin of Oriya language. From the point of view of language, the inscriptions of Hati Gumpha are near modern Oriya and essentially different from the language of the Ashokan edicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Harvard Lecture&quot;/&gt; A point has also been made as to whether Pali was the prevalent language in Orissa during this period. The Hathigumpha inscription|Hati Gumpha inscriptions, which are in Pali, are perhaps the only evidence of stone inscriptions in Pali. This may be the reason why the German linguist Prof. Hermann Oldenberg mentioned that Pali was the original language of Orissa.

Traces of Oriya words and expressions have been found in inscriptions dating from the 7th century AD. For example, the Oriya word କୁମ୍ଭାର /kumbha:rɔ/ ‘potter’ occurs in a copperplate inscription ‘belonging to a date not later than the 7th century AD’. Similarly, in inscriptions of 991 AD, Oriya words like ଭିତୁରୁ /bhituru/ ‘from inside’ and ପନ୍ଦର /pɔndɔrɔ/ ‘fifteen’ can be found. ‘An Oriya Passage’ also has been found in another inscription of about 715 AD.File:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|thumb|Eastern Hemisphere in 200 AD.

===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Oriya language===

The beginnings of Oriya poetry coincide with the development of Charya Sahitya, the literature thus started by Mahayana Buddhist poets. This literature was written in a specific metaphor named “Sandhya Bhasha” and the poets like Luipa, Kanhupa are from the territory of Orissa. The language of Charya was considered as Prakrita.

Paduma (Padma:Lotus), Chowshathi (64), Pakhudi (petals) Tahin (There), Chadhi (rise) nachao (to dance) Dombi (a female of Orissa from untouchable caste), Bapudi (a very colloquial Oriya language to apply as 'poor fellow').

===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===

Jayadeva was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an Utkala Brahmin family of Puri in circa 1200 AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem Gita Govinda, which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of Works of Jayadeva's literary contribution changed the pattern of versification in Oriya.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Oriya script''' or '''Utkala Lipi''' Oriya: ଉତ୍କଳ ଲିପି) or '''Utkalakshara''' (Oriya: ଉତ୍କଳାକ୍ଷର) is used to write the Oriya language, and can be used for several other Indian languages, for example, [[Sanskrit]]. It has developed from the Brahmi script as most of the other scripts that are used to write South-Asian Languages.

=== Independent vowels ===
The vowels &quot;ଇ&quot; (&quot;i&quot;), &quot;ଈ&quot; (&quot;ī&quot;), &quot;ଉ&quot; (&quot;u&quot;) and &quot;ଊ&quot; (&quot;ū&quot;)  are pronounced same as most long sounds are pronounced in the same way as short vowel sounds.

=== Consonants ===
The consonants ''j'' and ''y'' are pronounced the same in Oriya. Initial ''ḍa, ḍha'' vary with intervocalic ''ṛa, ṛha''.

|}

=== Dependent vowels ===

As in other abugida scripts, Oriya consonant letters have an inherent vowel. It is transliterated as ⟨a⟩, phonetic value {{IPA|[ɔ]}}. Its absence is marked by a halanta (''virāma''):

For the other vowels diacritics are used:
{|class=wikitable

|ka||kã||kaṁ||kaḥ||k
|-
|{{IPA|[kɔ]}}||{{IPA|[kɔ̃]}}||{{IPA|[kɔŋ]}}||{{IPA|[kɔh]}}||{{IPA|[k]}}
|}

(Note: In many Oriya fonts the vowels ''e, ai, o, au'' do not display properly; these are given work-arounds in parentheses below.)

|}

Vowel diacritics may be more or less fused with the consonants, though in modern printing such ligatures have become less common.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In short, the purpose of this course is to help you learn what distinguishes great writing from so-so writing from outright bad writing. One of the first things you should acknowledge if you want to learn how to be a good writer is that good writing isn't boring. You don't have to agree with its message or be convinced by its argument, but good writing is thought-provoking, interesting and above all, something worth reading. 

Whys is it these things and not, say, unoriginal, bland and not worth reading? Because every piece of good writing, in essence, is a conversation between the reader and the writer. Inherent to the idea of writing as a conversation is notion that the author is trying to instruct or argue something to the reader and the reader is either being persuaded or being stimulated to think about contradictions to the author's point of view. Although the reader very likely will not have the opportunity to directly interact with the author to bring up points he/she agreed or disagreed with, the act of &quot;conversing&quot; with an author as a reader is a way in which a piece of writing leaves an impact. Of course, conversations can be one sided, but generally speaking, they aren't very interesting if one side monopolizes the exchange. If an author allows for no room for counter-argument or merely presents a laundry list of facts and statistics, there's no much room for a conversation and thus, not all that much value of intellectual stimulation to the reader. Good writing should not just inform, but it should spark interest in the reader to read, research or even write more on the topic.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In writing, as in the rest of life, context is everything. Just as you would never wear pajamas to a formal job interview, nor would you ever write a formal paper with casual language, slang, jargon, sloppy grammar, and other similar writing deficiencies. Knowing who you're writing for is as important for a writer as knowing what you're writing and why you're writing in the first place. Are you writing for your professor? Your boss? Your friends? Your grandmother? The kind of writing you'd present to each of these people is likely going to vary quite considerably. For your professor, you will likely have formal research papers with a mix of facts and analysis. For a boss, you might have to write memos or progress reports, where raw data is the most important component. Writing for friends and family members can be considerably less formal. Defining your audience becomes all the more important when you consider that &quot;writing&quot; means more than just things in books, magazines or newspapers. The act of &quot;writing&quot; is a broad concept that encompasses anything that uses the written word to convey an idea or emotion: bumper stickers, film and television scripts, e-mails, text messages, notes you send your friends in class, even wikibook texts. In each of these cases, it's important to be aware who you're writing for just as much as it's important to know why you're writing. 

At the same time, when you define your audience, you determine what sort of facts you cover in your writing. Say you're writing a paper for a biology class where your audience is your professor (and any other readers in the field of biology), is it necessary to spend a considerable amount of your paper covering background of relatively basic biological concepts? Not at all, and in fact, your professor is more likely than not to think that you're thinking you're padding the essay with obvious information. Now, if you were writing a textbook for a high school biology class, your audience would now be considerably different, and you would naturally explain many more &quot;basic&quot; concepts in detail. 

Similar to the idea of writing as conversation, you don't have to agree with the audience you're writing for. In fact, if writing is meant to be a tool to persuade, then you naturally with be writing for audiences who do not initially see from your point of view. Take for example, political writing. Certainly, there are times when political writing is used to speak to those who already agree with the political position and &quot;rally the base&quot;. However, it is sometimes most practical for political writing to attack or persuade the opposition to see why their policies are &quot;wrong&quot;.</text>

== Getting Started ==
If you are new to Wikibooks, you might first want to look at [[Using Wikibooks]].  Details for creating a class project can be found at [[Using_Wikibooks/Class_Project_Guidelines|Class_Project_Guidelines]].  If you are completely new to Wikipedia, the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial Wikipedia tutorial] maybe helpful to you.  If you like to upload images to wikipedia, use the 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard File Upload Wizard].  However, only upload images if you created them and you own the copyright!


== Other Wikibooks ==
There are also other wikibooks on subjects related that are quite useful:
*[[Computer_Programming]]
Not related to the subject, but helping me to get the editing right:
*[[Game_Creation_with_XNA]]
*[[Social_Web]]


== Other Class Projects ==
Inspiration from successful class projects can be drawn here, which by themselves are also quite interesting and maybe helpful for this project:

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Apostrophe.png|thumbnail|left|The humble apostrophe ]]
[[File:George Bernard Shaw notebook.jpg|thumb|The Irish playwright, wit and linguist, George Bernard Shaw viewed apostrophes as largely redundant. In Shaw's view (Shaws view, as he would write it), they were &quot;uncouth bacilli&quot;. ]]

The apostrophe (') is a punctuation mark with an unfortunate tendency to be misused. As it exists, there are three uses of the apostrophe in the modern English language. 
* The marking of the omission of one or more letters (as in the contraction of ''do not'' to ''don't'').
* The marking of [possessive case (as in ''the cat's whiskers'').
* The marking as plural of written items that are not words established in English (as in ''P's and Q's'', ''the late 1950's''). (This is considered incorrect by some. The use of the apostrophe to form plurals of proper words, as in ''apple's'', ''banana's'', etc., is universally considered incorrect and is called a greengrocer's apostrophe.)

While this seems fairly straightforward, there are few errors of apostrophe use that are commonly made. In the case of singular possessive words that end with the letter 's', it is generally accepted to add an apostrophe but not an extra s (Jesus', Moses', Thomas'). In the case of plural possessive, there is often confusion, as well. Say you're talking about a dog owned by a family named the Thompsons. Do you write &quot;the Thompsons dog&quot;, &quot;the Thompson's dog&quot;, &quot;the Thompsons' dog&quot;. The answer, like the case of singular possessive that end with 's' is &quot;the Thompsons' dog&quot;. If you chose the first you would imply that it was a type of dog called Thompsons and the second would make it seem as if only one Thompson owned the dog, when then entire family of Thompsons did.

Going a step further, problems often arise when compounding plurals and possessives. Look at these distinct examples:
My friend's cat's food (the food of my one friend's one cat)
My friends' cat's food (the food of my multiple friends' one cat)
My friend's cats' food (the food of my one friend's multiple cats)
My friends' cats' food (the food of my multiple friends' multiple cats) 

When apostrophes become confusing like this, one sympathizes with would-be reformers of the English language, such as George Bernard Shaw, who hope to rid the language of this particular punctuation mark. But just imagine seeing:

&quot;My friends cats food&quot;

and trying to figure out what that meant from context alone.</text>

= Introduction =
This class will be a tour of the Social Web.  It will cover many topics, mostly just touching the surface.  But there will be plenty of opportunity to digg deeper and learn more by doing. 
 

== Idea behind this Class ==
There are two reasons for this class:
* learn about the social web, social media and social networks
* find out about new ways of teaching and learning


== Assignments == 
=== Ex.1: Google Trends === 
Use Google Trends to see how the popularity of the keywords ’MySpace, studiVZ, Facebook, Google’ has changed over the years.  Restrict your search to Germany.

Do the same for ’apple, microsoft, ibm’.  How could this tool be useful to you or your company?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Research and training ===
My training was in pure mathematics and I specialised in logic: recursive function theory and proof theory. I studied and taught the foundations of computing for 14 years at Edinburgh and Sheffield Universities. I now teach Mathematical Methods and Models with the Open University and do consultancy work in formal semantics using F# and other functional languages.  With 3 other partners, I am developing a permaculture project on 11.5 acres of land near Totnes. I am studying for the Diploma in Applied Permaculture Design.

=== Specialties ===
Horticulture; Permaculture; Mathematics; Formal specification; programming in F#, Mathematica, Haskell and ML; software testing; teaching and training; publishing; ebooks.

=== Goals ===
One of my goals is to use my knowledge of horticulture, mathematics and systems design to develop a life in community that is rewarding, sustainable and fun. I want to use action learning to develop and apply Permaculture in my life and work and to teach Permaculture principles and ethics.  I am learning how to apply Permaculture thinking to all the work I do, including IT/Mathematics research and consultancy.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In simplest terms, plagiarism is the use of the work of someone else and and claiming it to be yours. While this sounds like something you would obviously never do, there are many gray areas where people accidentally plagiarize when they don't mean to. Usually, this occurs when someone forgets to cite a piece of information in a paper that is either a direct quote or a paraphrasing from an author. The most important thing about avoiding plagiarism is that '''you can never be too safe.''' When in doubt, cite. When not in doubt, but it's clearly not your own interpretation/analysis, cite. Even if a sentence is largely your analysis of one fact, if you introduce that fact in that same sentence, cite the fact at the end of the sentence. 

Unless you have achieved a level of mastery of your subject (likely no one who is pursuing an undergraduate degree), most of the information you use in a paper did not spring forth from your brain with no original source. With the exception of basic facts that are considered &quot;common knowledge&quot;, you should cite where you got your facts about mitochondrial DNA, the Hapsburg Empire, symbolism in Emily Dickinson's poetry, Jung's theory of the collective unconscious, or whatever other subject on which you might be writing. 

It is also important to be aware of self-plagiarism. That is, you shouldn't lift whole paragraphs from one paper you wrote into another, without citing yourself (after first asking your professor if this is an acceptable practice for the assignment). 

Plagiarism is one of the most serious violations of academic or professional integrity a person can make. Those who plagiarize are often caught (it's hard to fool professors who have read widely across their respective fields) and the penalties are severe and last a lot longer than merely receiving an 'F' grade. Plagiarism is not a crime per se, but it can lead to possible accusations of copyright violation which is a crime.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">One might argue that reading and writing are two very different activities, that require two very different types of thinking. Yet, in many ways, reading and writing are actually quire complementary. Without a doubt, some of the best advice to become a better writer is simply to become a better reader. Read often and read a lot. If you want to master writing in a specific field, the best way to get an understanding of how writing in that field is crafted is to read closely and examine the models presented by other writers. Not only will you pick up on vocabulary and jargon used by writers, you'll consciously (or sub-consciously) start to notice certain patterns and styles used by authors that you might like to adapt to make your own writing better. Alternatively, you can read the works of others and just as easily figure out examples of style that you don't think make for good writing.</text>

== e-Portfolio ==

=== '''What is e-Portfolio?''' ===

An e-Portfolio is a collection of digital materials which ascertains a person's learning and understanding &lt;ref&gt; Sutherland and Powell, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The items most often found in an e-Portfolio include documents recounting a student's progress such as reflections, ideas, feedback, projects, and papers &lt;ref&gt; Beetham, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;/br&gt;

=== Why e-Portfolio is a current trend? ===

As education continues to change to meet the expanding needs of the diverse learners and the needs for success in the workforce, schools must raise student skills and find ways to embed technology into the curriculum and pedagogy.  This trend allows learners to set goals, plan, and record their achievements.  e-Portfolios have the ability to empower a student to collect a duration of prescribed documents, confirm accomplishments, and identify personal development planning throughout the learners lifelong journey in school, college, work, and professional growth &lt;ref&gt; JICS Info Net&lt;/ref&gt;.  An e-Portfolio emmpowers students to increase their understanding by showcasing their work and giving them the chance to reflect. It also provides a storage of work throughout their education including records of achievement, transcripts, and assessments.  E-portfolios can be used in a variety of capacities including demonstrating to a perspective college or university a student's accomplishments throughout earlier schooling and for employers it can be a resource to validate skills and abilities, such as communication and teamwork skills&lt;ref&gt; Stefani, Mason, &amp; Pegler, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

=== Implementation of e-Portfolio in the K-12 Setting ===

As education moves towards integrating and implementing technology new visions arise, which includes e-Portfolios.  
* Education has been driven to produce more outcome based results, increasing learning effectiveness, and being held accountable.&lt;/br&gt;
* Through e-Portfolios students will be empowered in managing their achievements, work, and learning goals.&lt;br/&gt;
* Implementation of e-portfolios is easy and free. &lt;br/&gt; 
* What is required is deciding on the container (website, blog, wiki, Google site?.  Once this decision has been made teachers can, decide on how it will be organized or they can leave this process to the student.  Lastly, students begin to post.&lt;/br&gt;
* For e-Portfolios to work it will require:&lt;/br&gt;
# Learners to have access to computers and the internet
# Time - time on the part of the teacher and student
# Technical support to both the teacher and student 
# Ability to have continual storage of the e-Portfolio system&lt;/br&gt;
* Professional development would be required for teachers and tutors to develop new skills to train, educate, and reinforce implementation and on going development needs. &lt;br/&gt; 
* Schools would need to incorporate e-Portfolios into the curriculum.&lt;/br&gt;
* When e-Portfolios are done right it can be an authentic learning device for students allowing them to view and share their accomplishments. &lt;/br&gt;

=== Key issues with e-Portfolio ===

Several issues to be aware of when considering e-Portfolios.
* Availability of computer access to all students inside and outside of school
* Technological support for the teacher and student
* Professional development for teachers 
* Requires additional time to implement, develop, and manage for student and teacher
* Students may not like the change

== Flipped Classroom ==
:&lt;/u&gt;

=== What is a Flipped Classroom? ===

The trend of flipping a classroom is when the teacher substitutes in-class instruction with at home video instruction and utilizes class time for homework assignments and other project based learning activities.  Foundation learning occurs through video presentation and formative assessment that occurs beyond the classroom.  &lt;br/&gt;

=== Why is Flipped Classroom a current trend? ===

The design of a flipped classroom is to maximize teacher-student interaction during face-to-face class time.  A flipped classroom utilizes project-based learning, integrates technology, and reinforces the classroom time to discuss and collaborate which reinforces the learning process.  The initial learning of the lessons occurs at home through videos.  This gives students the opportunity to learn at their own pace. When students enter the classroom, the teacher can create teaching and learning opportunities through the differentiation of content, process, assessmengt and/or learning environment. &lt;br/&gt;

=== Implementation of Flipped Classroom in the K-12 settings ===

* Flipping a classroom is gaining a lot of momentum in teaching. &lt;br/&gt; 
* Professor Eric Mazur tested this style of instruction back in the 1990’s at Harvard. &lt;br/&gt; 
* Salmen Khan has generated over 2200 videos used for the purpose of educating. &lt;br/&gt;  
* The Khan Academy which utilizes this trend. &lt;br/&gt; 
* The idea is that students learn the lesson at home through videos and other technologies. &lt;br/&gt; 
* In class instruction is spent doing homework assignments and inquiry based projects.&lt;br/&gt;   
* Teaching is a form of blended learning which incorporates technology with face to face learning.&lt;br/&gt;
* Teachers can track individual student progress and progress as a whole class.  &lt;br/&gt;
* Teachers can monitor time spent on specific topics by individual students.  &lt;br/&gt;
* When teachers notice specific students are struggling with a topic or problem they are able to work one-on-one or in small groups to conduct a mini workshop. &lt;br/&gt; 
* While working with those struggling students the remainder of the class is able to continue to work on other activities or project based learning.  &lt;br/&gt;
* This type of teaching allows instructors to use their time more effectively with students.   &lt;br/&gt;
* This concept takes passivity out of the classroom and the teacher becomes more of a coach or a mentor as opposed to a transmitter of learning. &lt;br/&gt;

=== Key issues with Flipped Classroom ===

Whenever there is the use of technology there are issues to consider.
* Availability of computer access to all students outside of school
* Technological support for the teacher
* Professional development for teachers
* Takes a lot of time to produce your lessons as a teacher
* Students may not like the change from the normal classroom 
* Don't try to rearrange the entire class, start small and build
* Make sure you have planned activities during class time.  They need to be hands on inquiry based projects

=== Related Research for Flipped Classroom ===

Research shows flipped classrooms are 
* Dependent upon coordination between face-to-face and the online aspect of the learning experience (So and Brush, 2008).  When these components work together a flipped classroom can be successful (Ginns and Ellis, 2007).
* Interactive technologies make it possible for educators to qualitatively reconceptualise the teaching and learning dynamic (Strayer, p. 3, 2012). 
* In a flipped classroom teachers are afforded the opportunity to develop stable learning environments (Garrison and Kanuka 2004).&lt;br /&gt;

== Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) ==

=== What is BYOD? ===
In a time of tight budget cuts, K-12 schools are looking for options to replace older technology, such as laptops and desktop computers. One option is for students to bring their own laptops, tablets,eReaders and even their own cell phones to school to replace older technology at school.

=== Why BYOD is a Current Trend ===
Students are reaching outside of their classroom walls to collaborate with each other, as well as with experts in the field.  In their homes, they use their cell phones, laptops and tablets to do their schoolwork. Not only is collaboration an important component of students in the 21st century, but the research available to them is vast, requiring a good system or filing and organization to keep the student's personal work organized.  But during the school day, all this material and organization of data is left at home, at a time when students should be adding even more during the school day than they do in the evening. With BYOD, students can now have the best of both worlds.

=== Implementation of BYOD in the K-12 Setting ===
There are changes that need to be made to implement BYOD, not just in terms of network preparation, changes in policy and teaching but there are ethical, social and cultural implications, as well.  Harris (2012) refers to Neil Postman’s essay “Five Things We Need to Know about Technological Change” when he describes the changes he feels are important for implementing BYOD.
* Districts need to be able to sustain the additional cost in network capacity, teacher training and the management of stolen, lost or damaged student property. 
* The district will need to be certain to meet the needs of their students, which will require purchasing the technology that parents will not be able to afford.  
* The technology will change classroom atmosphere.  Schools can have classes in lounges, rather than in classrooms with desks.  Will the school be prepared for this? 
* Standard assessments will be obsolete with BYOD.  Students could easily find test answers with their devices. 
* Smartphones will not make students smarter unless they are used to their full potential.   A smartphone to text answers to other students will not be making students smarter.

=== Key Issues with BYOD ===
'''Benefits of BYOD'''
Norris and Soloway (2011) describe the benefits of BYOD in this way:
&quot;…via BYOD, each student has direct access to the entire world’s information, to events, to places, to organizations, to people— in particular, to fellow students. With their computers, students can manipulate whatever they access and can create new content that they can contribute to the world’s information base&quot;(p. 114). Yet in their article, they stress that the devices are merely tools to be used, not the answer to all problems in education today.  In the hands of a skilled teacher, using curriculum developed for BYOD, a student will be able to learn and create.  BYOD would allow a one-to-one scenario, so that each child would be able to research and crate individually, not merely following the teacher, but exploring information on their own at their own pace.

Puente (2012) reported success with BYOD because administration found less student misbehavior and more student involvement.  But again, an important component of the success of BYOD is in teacher training and usage of the devices in a dynamic way.  There are currently many lesson plans using technology online.  In cases when students do not own their own personal device, students were able to share devices with each other.  The school network was open to all students but sites were still secure to protect students from harmful sites.

'''Downfalls of BYOD'''As mentioned above, teachers need to be effective with technology, and often teacher training does not include technology.  Many teachers, if given the option, will want to continue teaching the way they were taught, which did not use technology.  Another downfall for teachers using their own devices are privacy and security issues. Teachers might download a student IEP (Individualized Educational Program) or personal student information on their iPad, the the iPad might be stolen while still containing information that should not be shared.  Also, how would the IT department get secure information back from a teacher's device if the teacher leaves the district?

Security and network capability are great concerns for the IT department in districts that are using BYOD.  Harris (2012) states the importance of reviewing school policy and &quot;Acceptable Use Policies (AUP).  The school network will need to prepare for a huge jump in usage. The school will also have to have a detailed understanding of financial student responsibility, as well as insurances for theft and breakage.  The IT department will need to specify what problems they will be accountable to fix when student devices do not work.  And until there is functionality common to all devices, district personnel and students will need to patiently work together to resolve sharing issues.

== Free Agent Learners ==
=== Who are Free Agent Learners? ===
Free Agent Learners:
* Students who take learning into their own hands
* Students who use a vast range of technology tools, applications, learning resources, outside experts and even each other to make a personalized learning experience
* Students who are self-directed in their learning  and include information sharing and gathering on Facebook, as well as online assessments and tests to gauge their own status in knowledge about a particular topic.
* Student who use their cell phones/mobile devices for both organization of their gathered information and for increased productivity.

=== Why Free Agent Learners are a Current Trend ===
Since 2003, a survey has been given to students, teachers, administrators and parents, by Project Tomorrow, the nation’s leading education nonprofit organization striving to see that today’s students are well prepared to be tomorrow’s leaders and engaged citizens.
”  …the 2009 Speak Up National Findings provide compelling evidence that our nation’s K-12 students are increasingly taking responsibility ofor their own learning, defining their own education path through alternative sources, and feeling not just a right by a  responsibility for creating personalized learning experiences.  This ‘Free Agent Learner’ student profile is not a future persona for students that are beyond the current purview of today’s schools, Rather, the Free Agent Learner characteristics accurately depict the way many of today’s students are approaching learning.” (&quot;Speak up 2009”, 2010, p. 2).

=== Free Agent Learners in the K-12 Setting ===
The term, “digital native” has been changed to “free agent learner” by Project Tomorrow, believing that the term “free agent learner” more accurately describes a part of a generation that is interconnected through the internet, and not tethered to traditional educational institutions (Waters, J. K., 2011).  These free agent students know that the schoolhouse, teacher and textbook are not the only ones with a monopoly on knowledge or the educational process.  Instead, these students are leveraging a large range of tools, applications, learning resources, outside experts and even each other to make a personalized learning experience.  

The technology-based experiences the free agent student uses are self-directed by the students themselves, and include information sharing and gathering on Facebook, as well as online assessments and tests to gauge their own status in knowledge about a particular topic.  The student uses their cell phone for organization of their gathered information and for increased productivity.  
A free agent learner will take an online class for knowledge, but not necessarily for a grade.  They will access podcasts and videos to help them in classes they have difficulty in, and they contact experts (as well as other students) online to share new ideas and explore content. Using emerging technologies, these students are taking their educational destiny and future into their own hands, and are adapting technology tools for a lifetime of learning.  (&quot;Speak up 2009”, 2010)

With the use of technology and the internet, classrooms are being transformed.  Instead of the “I teach” mentality, the classroom becomes “we teach”.  The teacher is never a barrier in learning because the teacher does not know the answer, but both students and teacher can access the internet for questions they have.  Students have the information of the world at their fingertips.

=== Key Issues with Free Agent Learners ===
The potential difficulties or risks would be allowing students to be online without any safeguards in place. If the student brings in mobile devices in the classroom, and the school network is used, the students’ online searches would be protected.  However, unless there are parental filters in place, a student could go very quickly to a place online that is not safe, and material that is inappropriate could be seen.  Also, the student would need to be very careful to verify the site’s validity and ownership so as not to record false and inaccurate information.

In an article in the Journal of Continuing Education in Nursing,  DeSilets asks this question, “Are you ready to start designing rich, enabled learning activities for intentional learners so they can discover what they need to know to be successful health care professionals?” (DeSilets, 2011, p. 340). Will middle and high school teachers in all subject areas be able to design rich, enabled learning activities for their students to help them discover what they need to know to be a successful student and citizen?  What would be the result of a class room of free agent learners in a traditional setting, unable to search on their own? 

&quot;In many ways, that Free Agent Learner is every teacher's dream.  Nvertheless, that learner is challenging and disruptive of the order of authority of the classroom that has been comfortable to us...more and more of these learners...must find the traditional classroom more constraining and even less relevant every year.&quot; (Mardis, M. &amp; Howe, K., 2010, p. 9).

== Mobile Learning: The use of tablets, One-to-one initiatives, &amp; E-textbooks ==
=== What is Mobile Learning? ===
Mobile learning in both formal and informal environments continues to grow as technology evolves.  “Just as the college students of 2010 do not remember a time in their lives when the internet did not exist, the young children of today will not remember a time when there was not pad-based mobile devices and smart phones” (Geist, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Geist, E. (2011). The game changer: Using iPads in college teacher education classes. College Student Journal, 45(4), 758-768. &lt;/ref&gt; .  Because of this, three trends are emerging collectively as a means to increase student productivity and engagement, while at the same time, reducing educational cost for school leadership.  Tablet PCs, one-to-one initiatives and e-textbooks, when used together, can help teachers and students by incorporating the basics of mobile learning for each student in a format the student thrives using. Learning is no longer confined to the traditional classroom constructs allowing a variety of experiences to be academically saturated.  

Over the last 50 years, many trends have claimed to be an idea that would change the teaching and learning process. However, few have offered the capabilities of the Tablet PC.  Tablet PCs are traditional wireless notebook computers with the ability to produce digital ink by writing with a stylus or utilizing a touchscreen. Tablet PCs are lightweight, startup quickly, and may include removable keyboards or rotating screens. With many of the capabilities of a traditional computer, tablet PCs are effectively limiting the items a student needs for class by providing the opportunity to access documents and e-textbooks, take notes, and participate in interactive applications all from any location.  The cost of an average tablet PC is between $200 and $500, which includes the entry level iPad, yet basic tablet models can cost less than $200.  The cost of this device makes feasibility of a tablet PC initiative possible for many schools. 

In education, many leaders have considered implementation of a one-to-one initiative which provides each student with a computer to support learning. Specifics details for this initiative are typically defined by the program manager at the local level deciding on whether students take devices home, possible internet restricts, memory usage , and other external factors.  The primary component of any one-to-one program places technology in the students’ hands to use as a tool daily.  In a study conducted by Penuel (2006)&lt;ref&gt; Penuel, W. R. (2006). Implementation and effects of one-to-one computing initiatives: A research synthesis. Journal of Research On Technology In Education, 38(3), 329-348. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ728908.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;, research shows that “in order for technology to make a powerful difference in student learning, students must be able to use computers more than once or twice a week in a lab at school” (as cited in Kozma, 1991).  Many educational readers understand the benefits of this trend, yet face barriers prior to implementation.  One of the biggest obstacles for this program remains the cost.  Yet with rapid advances in technology and the onset of the tablet PC movement, cost is decreasing as a hindrance.  Many researchers argue that implementation of a one-to-one initiative supports equalization of learning opportunities for students of varied socioeconomic levels (Penuel, 2006). 

While e-textbooks were a new trend ten years ago, this trend is currently rising because of the popularity of e-readers and tablet PCs as well as changes made by publishing companies to increase user-friendliness.  “According to a recent sales report from the Association of American Publishers, adult e-book sales rose 49.4% in January 2012, more than triple the growth in mass market paperback sales (Miller, et al., 2012)&lt;ref&gt; Miller, J. R., Nutting, A. W., Baker-Eveleth, L., &amp; Cornell Higher Education Research Institute. (2012). The determinants of electronic textbook use among college students. Cornell Higher Education Research Institute, Retrieved from http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/cheri/workingPapers/upload/cheri_wp147.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;. With more people familiar with consuming textbooks digitally versus paper formats (McCarthy, 2011)&lt;ref&gt; McCarthy, D. (2011). Mobile perspectives: On E-Books. E-Reading--The transition in higher education. EDUCAUSE Review, 46(2), 20-22,. &lt;/ref&gt;, the sales of e-textbooks is predicted to also grow.    Advantages include “widespread accessibility, interactivity, increased visual appeal and dynamic linking to supplemental materials” (Murray &amp; Perez, 2011)&lt;ref&gt; Murray, M., &amp; Pérez, J. (2011). E-Textbooks are coming: Are we ready?. Issues In Informing Science &amp; Information Technology, 849-60. Retrieved from http://iisit.org/Vol8/IISITv8p049-060Murray307.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  These changes can help students actively engage in the reading for all content areas.

=== Why Mobile Learning is a Current Trend ===
Educational technology leaders should find the use of tablets, one-to-one initiatives and e-textbooks as important trends for many reasons.  Many schools face a budgetary obstacle when pursuing technological advancements. However, the impact of these three initiatives together could prove more affordable for districts and more beneficial for students. Tablet technology is rapidly becoming an accessible and affordable method of utilizing many programs in schools and businesses.  One-to-one initiatives have gained popularity as device costs have decreased.  Additionally, one-to-one programs provide each student with the capability to utilize technology without isolation to one classroom or teacher. The student can utilize similar technology throughout the school day increasing familiarity and user understanding.  Finally, e-textbooks are additionally appealing because of the cost of replacement books. In a school or district where a one-to-one program is already employed, using e-textbooks would be a logical solution considering each student would already have a device.  

Besides the economic benefits, the use of tablets in a one-to-one program could also prove beneficial for student engagement and learner motivation.  “The old model of pedagogy— teacher focused, one-way, one-size-fits-all— makes no sense to young people who have grown up in a digital world” (Tapscott, 2008)&lt;ref&gt; Tapscott, D. (2008). How to teach and manage 'generation net'. BusinessWeek Online. Retrieved from http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-11-30/how-to-teach-and-manage-generation-ne tbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice&lt;/ref&gt;.  Students are likely to enjoy utilizing tablets which will allow for further investigation into topics related to lessons based on learner preferences.  Tablets have a variety of functions which benefit students related to assistive technology tools, yet at times this singles out students with learning disabilities from the rest of the students.  Implementation of this trend would help a population of students because they would no longer be singled out as the only student able to use the tablet in the classroom based on his or her need for assistive tools.  By incorporating e-textbooks, learner interactivity improves.

=== Key Issues with Mobile Learning ===
While there are many benefits to implementing these trends, several concepts must be considered prior to and throughout implementation.  

* Infrastructure and electrical updates to support the facility needs
* Professional development and support for faculty members 
* Best practice strategies regarding appropriate instruction for authentic learning 
* Technical support must be available and a protocol for addressing issues with student machines must be established prior to device deployment
* User agreement policy is drafted and explained for all students

== '''Adaptive Learning'''==
:&lt;/u&gt;

=== What is Adaptive Learning ===
Adaptive learning is an educational method which uses computers as interactive teaching devices. Computers adapt the presentation of educational material according to students' learning needs, as indicated by their responses to questions and tasks. The motivation is to allow electronic education to incorporate the value of the interactivity afforded to a student by an actual human teacher or tutor. With the promise of personalized learning, instruction and quizzes aimed at a student’s specific needs and skills, adaptive learning is poised for widespread adoption, both at the K-12 and higher education levels.

=== Why is Adaptive Learning is a Current Trend ===
Shrinking budgets combined with higher expectations and more rigorous standards put increasing pressure on schools and teachers to do more with less. Adaptive learning technologies build on great teaching in the classroom by providing students with an individualized learning environment that is engaging and responsive to their own needs.

It is also an important trend in educational technology because as learners and instructors move online, adaptive learning is a more sophisticated solution for developing meaningful online relationships. If developed and used correctly, intelligent e-learning systems will clearly have a positive impact on the accessibility, affordability, and quality challenges that now confront global education and training.  Adaptive learning is also important because it will enable learners to select their own learning components to customize their personalized learning environments. Secondly, it enables them to offer more varied solutions that can adapt content to fit their own individual educational objectives.

Finally it is an important trend for educational technology due of the four aspects to adaptive learning: content management, access to instructors, system security, and tracking student activity. The leader who wants to implement this trend must have a strategy in place to address all four issues before an educational institution or organization can successfully implement an adaptive learning solution.

=== Adaptive Learning in the K-12 Setting ===
Currently there are three major Adaptive Learning programs currently used by K-12 and Higher Education is LearnSmart, Power of U, and ALEKS.  
*LearnSmart is a study tool for higher education that adaptively assesses students' skill and knowledge levels to track which topics students have mastered and which require further instruction and practice 
*The Power of U is a digitally rich personalized middle school math pilot program that uses real-time assessment data to group students in ways that allow them to learn at their own pace, in their own style, using the medium that works best for them (i.e. teacher-led or small group instruction or virtual tutoring). 
*ALEKS is a web-based assessment and learning system created by the ALEKS Corporation and currently is used in colleges and universities enjoyed pass rates of 76 percent, versus 51 percent for students in different sections of the same Algebra class who did not use ALEKS.

=== Key Issues with Adaptive Learning ===
Understanding these adaptive learning technologies is also important because they may soon begin to change the face of education as we know it.  The tailored curriculums that come with these technologies provide four things for the students:
*Instant feedback 
*Personalized learning
*Supporting different learning styles
*Reflection and self-awareness

Concerns for Adaptive Learning
*Does the technology offer only a few paths with student-directed pacing or does it offer a multitude of learning paths?
*Does the technology only focus on practice or does it offer a rich environment for developing conceptual understanding and problem solving?
*Does the technology appeal to a narrow range of students or does it empower all students with choices and personalized challenges that help them take ownership of their learning experience?
*What is the cost factor for implementing this technology and would it cost positions in the end?

== '''Natural User Interfaces'''==
:&lt;/u&gt;

=== What are Natural User Interfaces ===
A natural user interface (NUI) is a system for human-computer interaction that the user operates through intuitive actions related to natural, everyday human behavior.  Natural User Interfaces may be operated in a number of different ways, depending on the purpose and user requirements.  Some examples of Natural User Interfaces are motion-sensing equipment such as Microsoft Kinect, the touchscreens of tablets and phones, and voice-activation technology.

=== Why are Natural User Interfaces is a Current Trend ===
The idea of a natural user interface can be considered a trend in educational technology because of the amount of space that will be needed to use these emerging technologies as well as the change in hardware and software that will need to accompany the use of this technology in the classroom setting.  Teachers will be able to incorporate the technology into lessons in math, reading, social studies, science, music and physical education. For example, as students could simulate playing darts, count their tosses and hits, then calculate fractions, percentages and decimals. In physical education, students won’t realize they’re exercising as they mimic digital dancers.  For the special education students, playing virtual games by using themselves as the remote or interface could help with fine-motor skills.

=== Natural User Interfaces in the K-12 Setting ===
An example of how NUI’s can be incorporated into the K-12 setting is the Loudoun County school system which has been experimenting with the Kinect since last year. Students essentially act as their own remote controls to power the device, which has powerful sensors that capture the user’s movements. The games display on a TV or projector screen and the teachers incorporate the technology into lessons in math, reading, social studies, science, music and physical education. For example, as students simulate playing darts, they count their tosses and hits, and then calculate fractions, percentages and decimals. In physical education, students barely realize they’re exercising as they mimic digital dancers(Mellon, 2012).
Loudoun County has seen particular success in using the gaming system with special education students, particularly those on the autism spectrum, who struggle with social skills. The students create avatars and then articulate a story about one of their social challenges and their plans for coping with it in the future(Mellon, 2012). As the student speaks, so does the avatar, projected on a screen a few feet away. The teachers and parents say the children embrace the task because they see it as a game and are less fearful because they are speaking through an avatar. Autistic students, tasked with navigating a virtual raft down a virtual river with their classmates, practice cooperation, social skills and overcoming obstacles(Mellon, 2012).

=== Key Issues with Natural User Interfaces ===
NUIs are attractive tools for education and training because of the potential to create(Rees, 2010):
*A sense of immediacy and immersion in the learning environment
*A sense of individualized engagement
*An adaptive learning environment that responds as the learner interacts with it
*Collaboration environments that respond quickly to users’ intentions (e.g., via gestures)
*A virtual lab experience (e.g., allowing users to interact with virtual models and other objects)
*Educational tools for learners who learn differently (e.g., learners with autism)
*Educational tools for learners with physical challenges (e.g., learners with mobility challenges might use text commands to drive computer interactions)

There are also concerns over NUI’s: 
*Cost-benefit ratios (very device/application specific)
*Mobility of a particular platform/device(for items like the Kinect and Wii)
*The learning curve needed to optimize use of the tool(professional development)
*The ability to integrate the device into natural learning (and work) flows

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trivial but confusing for novices to Celestia (like myself). BTW, thanks to all who have contributed to this great tool!  In the observer:gotolonglat() example code, a camera vector is defined on line 9.

but not used in the following line 10.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Storyboarding is used to plan what is going to be in the panels and to help with deciding the layout of a comic. To begin, draw small sketches of key events in your story and put them in order in front of you. Draw more of these frames until you have enough to tell the story.

The Term Freelance Developer can go along way. The road I took as a programmer started out in 1977 with 
a combination of Timex, T.I, and I.B.M. Dos using G and M code. I used a cassette tape recorder to store 
data and to retrieve it. I was fascinated by goto, gosub, print, screen, and window using basic and q-basic. 
Boy has that changed fast. I stayed in touch scripting in c and c+ up until php came along. And gradually i 
jumped on it using a homemade server for html and c languages. Bit by bit i added libraries for php and then 
in 2001 jumped on the bandwagon with the release of 
sessions, globals, get, and post methods. Back in 2006 i started wrangling with classes and functions. 
But the more advanced php became within it's libraries, i soon realized that classes and function were 
beginning to become unnecessary. And so I reverted to my old ways of creating frameworks that 
follow a fluid alphabetical and numerical order within name spaces. Further to approach handlers and methods
I started adding config files to store all variable naming and designed a form entry sytem to handle everything
within itself. This sounded far fetched but after testing with several servers knew i was on the right track.
I soon created Essence a framework that compliments php using a user-partitioned approach to naming which
allows switching and changing of everything including tags labels,paging, scripting, and filing using numerators 
placed strategically at the end of single letters. Thus allowing me to switch or change them using assigned $partition-variables 
to name everything within an application. And ultimately allowing me to manipulate modules, data, and resources fluidly.
    A simpler way to handle Functions without functions and to tranfer scripts and parts into pages. See below !
    
    include config.php which contains two variables one defined variable as $url_1='Home'; the page name, and one 
    to name the actual page route $urla1='a1';    
    $url_a1 = array(a1a.php,a1a.a1a1.php,a1.a1b.php,a1.a1c.a1ca.php);  // These bring in the array of INCUDED files for that one page &quot;a1&quot;.
    and the action will happen in the browser window upon the change.
    The resulting namespace is passed using the $_Post and $_Get method. 
    And thus can be sanitized either way and can be switched simply by changing the name.
    The name change partition is done by inserting a user-partition as a $partic variable
    $partic='1'; 
    IF $partic !='1'; {$partic = '2';}ELSE{$partic = '3';}
      If $partic = '3'; {$partic = '4';}ELSE{$partic = '5';}  //not related to below //
Thus to handle passing pages or modules we add the $partic partition variable to handle the switch.
       $url_a $partic which now becomes $url_a1. Thus allowing us to pass this to the link, browser, or script fluidly.
       include('$url_a,$partic').php;  which will inlcude the page parts of a1.php which has been labeled as both $url_a1 and named $url_1
       where the $partic has switched and renamed the page includes array's. And also contains the needed page parts for that page.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Multiple Sclerosis? ==
Multiple Sclerosis is the demyelinating inflammatory disease of the CNS with subsequent destruction of myelin, oligodendrocytes and axons&lt;ref&gt; Noseworthy, J,H., Lucchinetti, C., &amp; Rodriguez, M. (2000) Multiple Sclerosis. New England Journal of Medicine. 343 (13). 938-952&lt;/ref&gt;. The disease process involves the activation and transport of inflammation cells to brain&lt;ref&gt; White, L,J., &amp; Dressendorfer R.H. (2004) Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis. Journal of Sports Medicine. 34 (15). 1077-1100&lt;/ref&gt;.   The exact cause and sequence that leads to this process are yet to be determined; however we do know increased activation of natural killer cells to attack myelin proteolipid protein characterizes the pathogenesis of MS &lt;ref&gt; Owens, T. (2003) The enigma of multiple sclerosis: inflammation and neurodegeneration cause heterogeneous dysfunction and damage. Current opinion in neurology. 16 (3). 259-265&lt;/ref&gt;. Myelin plays the role of speeding up nerve impulses &lt;ref&gt; Hartline, D,K,. (2008) What is Myelin? Neuron Gila Biology. 4 (2) 153-163 &lt;/ref&gt;. Demyelination compromises nerve fiber function by slowing axonal conduction velocity &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;. MS can cause axial injury or death. Altered conduction in motor and sensory tracts within the CNS can disturb gait and balance, increase the risk of falls and reduce daily lifestyle activity &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;. 
MS symptoms include balance issues, lack of proprioception, visual problems, muscle weakness and fatigue, elimination dysfunction, depression and anxiety, and a higher risk of respiratory diseases, heart disease, and metabolic disorders&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;. Multiple Sclerosis affects 23,000 Australians, 73% of which are women.  The mean age of diagnosis is 30years&lt;ref&gt; Tsang, B, K-T., &amp; Macdonnell, R. (2011). Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Australian Family Physician. 40(12) &lt;/ref&gt;.

== What causes MS? ==
Although we understand the chemical process of MS the cause which starts the process has not yet been discovered.
== Treatment of MS ==
MS is an incurable disease however there are different avenues that can be taken to try to prevent or slow its progression. Not only does the actual disease need to be treated, but also the symptoms that can debilitate sufferers. MS is a disease that can affect sufferers constantly or in relapses&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;.

Depending on the type of symptoms and their severity there are different types of drugs which doctors prescribe.
Researchers are exploring the positive implications of physical exercise to improve functional capacity and quality of life in MS patients, this can include aerobic and resistance training but also other types of exercise including yoga&lt;ref&gt; Hernandez-Reif, M., Field, T., &amp; Theakston, H. (1998) Multiple sclerosis patients benefit from massage therapy. Journal of Body Work and Movement Therapies. 2(3).168-174&lt;/ref&gt; and aqua aerobics&lt;ref&gt; Stroud, N., Minahan, C., &amp; Sabapathy, S. (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Background to hypertension ===
Blood pressure is a measurement of the force of the blood against the walls of arteries as the heart pumps blood through the body&lt;ref&gt;Medline Plus (2012) Hypertension . [online] Available at: www.nim.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000468.htm [Accessed: 19 Oct 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; It is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is presented as systolic pressure (the pressure exerted on the blood vessels by the heart when it contracts) over diastolic pressure (the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart relaxes and dilates).
A normal healthy blood pressure reading is 120mmHg systolic/80mmHg diastolic, however when systolic blood pressure is ≥140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure is ≥90 mmHg then it is categorised as hypertension&lt;ref&gt;World-heart-federation.org (2012) Hypertension . [online] Available at: www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors/hypertension/ [Accessed: 20 Oct 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes of hypertension ===
The exact causes of hypertension are usually unknown however there are lifestyle and physiological factors that are highly associated with the condition, 
these include&lt;ref&gt;Medicalnewstoday.com (2009) What Is Hypertension? What Causes Hypertension?. [online] Available at: www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/150109.php [Accessed: 20 Oct 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;:

:*'''Lifestyle/Dietary Causes''': Being overweight, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition (most notably low fruit &amp; vegetable intake and a higher consumption of salts and saturated fats), Stress

:*'''Physiological/Disease Causes''': Diabetes, medications (such as birth control), Chronic Kidney Disease, adrenal and thyroid problems/tumors

=== Health issues associated with hypertension ===
There are many potential health complications that hypertension can cause particularly in persistent and/or untreated hypertension, these include&lt;ref&gt;Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (2012) High blood pressure (hypertension). [online] Available at: www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-blood-pressure/H100062 [Accessed: 19 Oct 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;:

:*'''Heart complications''': Heart attack, cardiovascular disease, enlargement of left ventricle, atrial fibrillation

:*'''Artery complications''': Arteriosclerosis, aneurysm, Coronary Artery Disease 

:*'''Kidney complications''': Kidney scarring, kidney artery aneurysm, chronic kidney disease

:*'''Brain complications''': Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
=== Treatments ===
The ultimate goal behind treatment is to reduce blood pressure and as a result protect the body from the negative consequences associated with high blood pressure. Treatment options often require the combination of drug therapy and lifestyle factors such as diet modifications and physical activity.
====Medication====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug Anti-hypertensive medications ] are a popular form of treatment in patients suffering from hypertension and are '''advantageous''' over exercise in terms of:  
:* Convenience (especially time) 
:* The speed at which they act (fast acting)
  
There are a number of different types of hypertensive medications and it is not uncommon for patients suffering from hypertension to require the use of a combination of medications. Different categories of medications  reduce blood pressure in different ways, the 4 major methods of reducing blood pressure include: &lt;ref&gt;Medications for treating hypertension, 2009, Harvard Health Publications, Harvard Medical School, viewed 20/10/2012 http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Womens_Health_Watch/2009/August/Medications-for-treating-hypertension&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Preventing blood vessels from constricting – e.g. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
:2. Reducing heart rate – e.g. Beta blockers
:3. Allowing blood vessels to relax – e.g. Vasodilators and Calcium channel blockers
:4. Decreasing blood volume – e.g. Diuretics

Although there is plenty of evidence to support the use of anti hypertensive medication, there are also a number of '''disadvantages''' associated with there use, these include,
:* Unwanted side effects e.g. dizziness, weakness, headaches and diarrhea
:* Cost
:* Limited effectiveness- most hypertensive patients require multiple medications to gain any worthwhile benefit.

==== Exercise ====
Non- pharmacological approaches for reducing hypertension have long been preferred as the primary form of treatment&lt;ref&gt;HAGBERG, J. M., PARK, J. J. &amp; BROWN, M. D. 2000. The role of exercise training in the treatment of hypertension: an update. / Le role de l'entrainement dans le traitement de l'hypertension: mise a jour. Sports Medicine, 30, 193-206.&lt;/ref&gt;. Of these treatments, physical activity is considered to be one of the most beneficial interventions and can be used in conjunction with anti hypertensive medications to provide further reductions&lt;ref&gt;WARBURTON, D. E. R., NICOL, C. W. &amp; BREDIN, S. S. D. 2006. Health benefits of physical activity: the evidence. Canadian medical association journal, 174, 801-809.&lt;/ref&gt;. Exersise as a form of treatment is '''advantageous''' over medication in terms of:

:* Promoting a whole body response - unlike medications, exercise will also positively effect other body systems 
:* Affordability
:* providing a variety of physical, mental and social benefits

Current research suggests that regular physical activity can help reduce blood pressure both directly and indirectly in a number of ways, these include:

:•	'''Directly:''' by decreasing  systolic blood pressure, on average between  5 – 25mmHg &lt;ref&gt;WALLACE, J. P. 2003. Exercise in hypertension: a clinical review. Sports Medicine, 33, 585-598.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
:•	'''Directly:''' by decreasing  diastolic blood pressure, on average between 3 – 25mmHg&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;

:•	'''Indirectly:''' by encouraging weight loss and improving cardiovascular health &lt;ref&gt;NETER, J. E., STAM, B. E., KOK, F. J., GROBBEE, D. E. &amp; GELEIJNSE, J. M. 2003. Influence of weight reduction on blood pressure a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Hypertension, 42, 878-884.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;FAGARD, R. H. 2001. Exercise characteristics and the blood pressure response to dynamic physical training. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 33, 484-492.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In spite of the obvious benefits of exercise as a treatment, there are also some associated '''disadvantages''' some of which include:

:* Time - both the time required to exercise daily as well as the time it takes to see reductions in blood pressure
:* Difficulty for those with limited mobility or those suffering from chronic pain.

=== Recommendations ===
Regular exercise has the potential to benefit all forms of hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;CLÉROUX, J., FELDMAN, R. D. &amp; PETRELLA, R. J. 1999. Lifestyle modifications to prevent and control hypertension. 4. Recommendations on physical exercise training. Canadian Hypertension Society, Canadian Coalition for high blood pressure Prevention and Control, Laboratory Centre for Disease Control at Health Canada, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal, 160, S21.&lt;/ref&gt;. It can be used in combination with medications to enhance blood pressure reduction in those suffering severe hypertension, or as a primary source of treatment in mild hypertension and even as a preventative measure for those at risk of developing hypertension&lt;ref&gt;APPEL, L. J. 2003. Lifestyle Modification as a Means to Prevent and Treat High Blood Pressure. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 14, S99-S102.&lt;/ref&gt;. Current exercise recommendations for reducing blood pressure include &lt;ref&gt;WALLACE, J. P. 2003. Exercise in hypertension: a clinical review. Sports Medicine, 33, 585-598.&lt;/ref&gt;:
:* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise Cardiorespiratory exercise] e.g. walking, cycling or jogging
:* Minimum 3 days per week - However higher frequencies generally result in greater reductions&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; 
:* 20 - 60 min per session&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;
:* At 40%-70% maximum effort&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;

Contrary to popular belief '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_training Resistance training]''' does not make hypertension worse. However there is a lack of evidence to show its effectiveness in reducing high blood pressure and therefore cardiovascular training should make up a majority of a hypertensive patients exercise program.&lt;ref&gt;FAGARD, R. H. 2006. EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE: EFFECTS OF ENDURANCE TRAINING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING. Clinical &amp; Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology, 33, 853-856.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although regular exercise is well documented as an effective form of reducing blood pressure, '''precautions''' should still be made in order to best maintain the health of the individual. Such precautions and considerations include&lt;ref&gt;SHARMAN, J. E. &amp; STOWASSER, M. 2009. Australian association for exercise and sports science position statement on exercise and hypertension. Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 12, 252-257.&lt;/ref&gt;:
:* '''Resting Blood pressure:''' Exercise should be postponed in poorly maintained blood pressure e.g. a resting blood pressure reading &gt;180mmHg systolic or &gt;110mmHg diastolic&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;
:* '''Medications:''' Be aware of the effect of medications on the body e.g. decreases thermoregulation capacity&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;  
:* '''Exercise blood pressure:''' Cessation of exercise if blood pressure rises  above 250mmHg systolic or 115mmHg diastolic&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <comment>/* Ensuring Tomcat doesn't run out of memory */ More memory notes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A single webserver can be configured to serve multiple instances of OpenClinica.  Alternatively, [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/developers/2012-October/004284.html multiple Tomcat servers] can be set up on a given webserver.

= Copying an existing instance =
Probably the simplest way to setup another instance is to copy an existing instance.
*Gerben details a method in Linux in [http://www.trialdatasolutions.com/tds/howto/settingupatestenvironment.jsp Setting up a test-environment].
*[[OpenClinica_User_Manual/BackupAndRestore|Backup and restore]] details how to backup and restore an existing instance to a new instance.

=Deploying a new instance from scratch=
You can deploy a new instance from scratch, in a similar way to deploying a simple OpenCinica instance.  Note that links in this document are for the [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installation-linux OpenClinica Linux documentation], similar sections can be found in the [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installing-openclinica-windows Openclinica Windows documentation]

#You need to create a differently named database (just the db, not a new role) such as ‘newtrial’ (following [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installation-linux#content-title-4339 section 9.1.7] of the OpenClinica installation guide)

#Copy the OpenClinica war file (as per [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installation-linux#content-title-4340 section 9.1.8]) as ‘newtrial.war’ (the next section in the manual mentions webservices, which I haven’t used).  Start Tomcat (if it isn’t already running) to deploy the ‘newtrial’ folders and the database structure.

=Separating out the log files=
You can separate out the log files from different instances by updating the datainfo.properties file, found in:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
${catalina.home}/webapps/${WEBAPP.lower}/WEB-INF/classes/datainfo.properties
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Update the log.dir line to put the logs in a separate directory:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
log.dir=${catalina.home}/logs/newtrial/newtrial
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Restart the instance in Tomcat (or Tomcat itself) for these changes to be picked up.

=Managing multiple instances=
To properly stop instances of OpenClinica you will need to fully stop Tomcat.  Once Tomcat is fully stopped, you can move files and update the database in an unrestricted manner.  The current version of OpenClinica (3.1.2) does not clean up after itself if the instance has been stopped in Tomcat Manager (e.g. http://localhost:8080/manager/html ).   One benefit of running [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/developers/2012-October/004284.html multiple Tomcat servers] is that the number of instances on a given server is reduced, so in the event of needing to stop an instance by stopping Tomcat, the number of instances affected is reduced.

The benefits and drawbacks of setting up multiple Tomcat servers (benefit: each instance is independent; drawback: increased resource consumption - memory used by Tomcat), versus the number of instances served from each (benefit: shared use of resources; drawback: dependence on a single Tomcat instance) should be weighed up.

==Ensuring Tomcat doesn't run out of memory==
Running a number of instances can cause the Tomcat to run out of memory if you don’t tweak Tomcat’s configuration (increasing the MaxPermSize setting).  [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installation-linux#content-title-5460 OpenClinica's Linux doc] states:

&quot;The MaxPermSize value depends on the number of war files that you are deploying. The web war needs a 180m of PermGen and the ws war needs a 90m of PermGen memory settings.&quot;
(the [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/installation/installing-openclinica-windows#content-title-5461 Windows doc] has a similar note)

The PermGen (Permanent Generation) memory is allocated separately to the regular (Heap) memory (a.k.a. the Xmx setting in Linux and the 'Maximum Pool Size' setting in Windows) [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1010986/why-does-my-sun-jvm-fail-to-initialize-when-i-set-permgen-above-128m].  Consequently, if your server doesn't have much memory, you may need to reduce the memory allocated to the Heap to allow you to increase the memory allocated to Permanent Generation.  This can be achieved by reducing the the Xmx setting (in Linux) or the 'Maximum Pool Size' setting (in Windows) and increasing the MaxPermSize setting by an equivalent amount.

=Replicating user account passwords to a new instance=
You can use replicate an existing user password to a new instance (so they can reuse their password for a new instance).  This can be achieved by copying the value of the 'passwd' field (actually the SHA1 hash of the password) in the 'user-account' table for that user from the old instance to the new instance.  If the user hasn't previously logged in (e.g. you have just created the account), you can set the passwd_timestamp to the current date (as if the user has just set their password).

This achieves a similar effect to a single instance in that a single username and password can access multiple studies (but via different URLs).  There is extra burden that if passwords change, then they may need to be re-set on all instances.

Reusing passwords is in general bad, particularly if they are used for different purposes under different security regimes, such as a bank account password being reused for an insecure OpenClinica instance or a live OpenClinica instance password being reused for an insecure public OpenClinica instance.

      <comment>Some thoughts about splitting/moving UNIX text</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">While this is a nice and useful introduction to UNIX, and many people entering the NGS field need to read it, it should be explained in the beginning ''why'' this knowledge is essential. Also, maybe the UNIX intro part should be split into its own (and appropriately titled) page, and the GUIs should be discussed on another page. Some people might have a basic grasp of UNIX, but never heard about Galaxy; they could skip the UNIX page. Or, the UNIX page could be moved to/merged with [[Guide to Unix]]; since this book is primarily web-based and not printed, a dedicated UNIX page may seem a little out-of-place. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] ([[User talk:Magnus Manske|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Magnus Manske|contribs]]) 10:51, 10 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome! ==
My name is Vicky Schneider and I am here as part of the effort to get a [[Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)|wikibook]] covering Next Generation Sequencing from the instructional perspective, so &quot;how to's&quot;, tutorials, exercices, share experience when it comes to analysis workflows etc. 

The idea is not to create a redundant effort but to work together, complement and make the most of existing efforts. Ideally, linking to and from existing and valuable source of relevant information (e.g. [http://seqanswers.com/wiki/SEQanswers Seqanswers], the [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology|Wikipedia:WikiProject Computational Biology]]) and providing a platform for everchanging materials, including exercises and case studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Conjunctions are words that connect two words, phrases, clauses or phrases together. Conjunctions can either be ''coordinating'' or ''subordinating''. Coordinating conjunctions connect two equal words, clauses or sentences. Common coordinating conjunctions and their uses include:

*'''For''' presents a reason &quot;I go on walks with my dog for it's healthy exercise.&quot;
*'''And''' presents non-contrasting item(s) or idea(s) &quot;I walk my dog and play fetch with him.&quot;
*'''Nor''' presents a non-contrasting negative idea &quot;Neither do I walk my dog nor do I play fetch with him.&quot;
*'''But''' presents a contrast or exception &quot;I walk my dog but I never play fetch with him.&quot;
*'''Or''' presents an alternative item or idea &quot;I can choose to walk my dog or play fetch with him.&quot;
*'''Yet''' presents a contrast or exception &quot;I walk my dog, yet I refuse to play fetch with him.&quot;
*'''So''' presents a consequence &quot;I walk my dog so we're both in good shape.&quot;

Subordinating conjunctions, also called subordinators, are conjunctions that conjoin an independent clause and a dependent clause. The most common subordinating conjunctions in the English language include after, although, as, as far as, as if, as long as, as soon as, as though, because, before, if, in order that, since, so, so that, than, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, and while.

There is a long-held grammatical controversy that when writing, beginning a sentence with &quot;and&quot; &quot;but&quot; or &quot;so&quot; is unacceptable. Although there is no historical precedent for this to be considered incorrect, it is largely frowned upon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The articles in English are the definite article 'the' and the indefinite articles 'a' and 'an' (and sometimes some).

The rules of English grammar require that in most cases a noun, or more generally a noun phrase, must be &quot;completed&quot; with a determiner to clarify what is the referent of the noun phrase.[1] The most common determiners are the articles the and a(n), which specify the presence or absence of definiteness of the noun. Other possible determiners include words like this, my, each and many – see English determiners. There are also cases where no determiner is required, as in the sentence John likes fast cars.

The definite article the is used when the referent of the noun phrase is assumed to be unique or known from the context. For example, in the sentence The boy with glasses was looking at the moon, it is assumed that in the context there will be only one boy with glasses, and only one moon, that could be being referred to. However the definite article is not used:

* with generic nouns (plural or uncountable): cars have accelerators, happiness is contagious, referring to cars in general and happiness in general (compare the happiness I felt yesterday, specifying particular happiness);
* with many proper names: John, France, London, etc.

The indefinite article a (before a consonant sound) or an (before a vowel sound) is used only with singular, countable nouns. It indicates that the referent of the noun phrase is one unspecified member of a class. For example, in the sentence An ugly man was smoking a pipe, it is assumed that in the context there is no specific ugly man, and no specific pipe, that is known to be being referred to.

With plural or uncountable nouns when the referent is indefinite, zero article is often used (the same as in the generic definite case described above). However in such situations the determiner some is often added (or rather any in negative contexts and many questions). For example:

* There are apples in the kitchen or There are some apples in the kitchen;
* We do not have information or We do not have any information;
* Would you like tea? or Would you like some tea? or Would you like any tea?

Additionally, articles are not normally used:
* in noun phrases that contain other determiners (my house, this cat, America's history), although it is possible to combine articles with certain other determiners, as in the many issues, such a child
* with pronouns (he, nobody), although again certain combinations are possible (as the one, the many, the few).
* preceding noun phrases consisting of a clause or infinitive phrase (what you've done is very good, to surrender is to die).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, you will learn how writing is, in a sense, a form of conversation. On the one hand, writing is a conversation with yourself as much as it is a conversation with a stated audience. In the process of creating a piece of writing, you will hopefully challenge your own assumptions so that your own argument can challenge the assumptions of your readers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Compared to many other languages, English is relatively &quot;ungendered&quot;. That is, for the most part nouns in English are not considered 'masculine' or 'feminine' and articles and pronouns do not vary a great deal as they do in other languages. The only truly gender-sensitive issues that occur in the English language concern the use of pronouns for people of a specific gender (men, women, boys, girls, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, etc.) What this means, of course, is that the pronoun to a masculine noun like 'man' or 'boy' is going to be 'he' or 'him'. The pronoun to a feminine noun like 'woman' or 'girl' is going to be 'she' or 'her'. Unlike many other languages, the pronoun for a noun that doesn't have a specifically designated gender is simply 'it' or 'they' (if plural). The table is 'it'. The phone is 'it'. The cup of coffee is 'it'. 

While all this seems straightforward, there is a common mistake often made in writing involving gender-sensitive writing. Say you're writing about a classroom of students and you write &quot;The teacher told each student to present their book report...&quot; Perfectly acceptable? Technically, no. The correct sentence would read &quot;The teacher told each students to present his/her book report...&quot; Why is this so? The use of 'their' indicates the possessive of the plural 'they'. However, the inclusion of 'each student' is not plural. 'Each student' is an individual. Because the class is comprised of both male and female individuals we can't just use the singular &quot;his&quot; or &quot;her&quot; without the inclusion of the other. It's a messy construction, but it's technically correct.

They can run fast to protect themselves from predation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Leel |first1=W. |year=2010 |title=Masked Shrew |retrieved from l=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/sorex_cinereus/ |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;


| reproduction = Young become sexually active at 2 months although few females have their first litter until the spring after their birth. Their average litter size is around 6.5 neonates at birth the young can exhibit movements but cannot crawl,see, or hear. they are weaned and grown enough to leave the nest at 27 days of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hazardl |first1=E. |year=1982 |title=The Masked Shrew |periodical=Mammals in Minnesota |pages=21-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|notes = All shrews (including the masked shrew) have a very high metabolic rate which includes and very fast heart beat. Some shrews have had their heartbeats measured at 1200 beats per minute. To maintain themselves they must eat their weight in food every day. This is accomplished by eating every few minutes. With a heart beating so fast the animals are easily startled and with deadly consequences, as they have been known to die of fright after a loud burst of thunder.

'''[[#Delayed Fertilization|Delayed Fertilization]]''' -- Most mammals enter a stage called gestation upon fertilization; however, some mammals have the ability to delay gestation by entering a state of dormant fertilization called blastocyst. &lt;ref name=Aa&gt;{{Citation |year=n.d. |title=Implantation|periodical=University of Wyoming |url=http://www.uwyo.edu/wjm/repro/implant.htm |accessdate=October 14, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; During this dormant state, the embryo is not implanted into the uterus. Nearly 100 different types of mammals in seven different orders have the ability to use this strategy. &lt;ref name=Bb&gt;{{Citation |year=n.d. |title=Delayed Implantation |periodical=The Animal Files |url=http://www.theanimalfiles.com/glossary/delayed_implantation.html|accessdate=October 14, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; Mammals in these orders can put off gestation for an extended amount of time, sometimes even up to a year. One type of delayed fertilization includes facultative diapause, or the ability for lactating mothers who become pregnant to delay fertilization. This type of delayed fertilization is caused by the sucking stimulus of the baby. A second type of delayed fertilization is obligate diapause, or the ability for mother's to delay fertilization until environmental conditions become favorable to increase the chances of offspring survival. &lt;ref name=Bb&gt;{{Citation |year=n.d. |title=Delayed Implantation |periodical=The Animal Files |url=http://www.theanimalfiles.com/glossary/delayed_implantation.html|accessdate=October 14, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Cc&gt;{{Citation |last1=Wund |first1=M. |last2=Myers |first2=P.  |year=2005 |title=Reproduction|periodical=Mammalia |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Mammalia/ |accessdate=October 14, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

==Functional Analysis==

In a conceptual design such as this we want to establish one or more program concepts.  The concepts describe in a general way how the program will operate.  Then we begin a process of breaking down this general description into more detailed steps called '''Functions'''.  Functions generally transform a set of inputs into a set of outputs.  These inputs and outputs are called '''Flows''', and may include any kind of entity: humans, data, hardware, energy.  Functions do not define how the transformations happen, just that they occur.  The how is embodied in a design solution or alternative, which will come later.

Human civilization already exists, and is expanding in measures of population, energy use, and GDP.  There are already space programs that also exist.  So the first program concept, which we will call the '''Existing Baseline''' is to simply continue current activities without adding anything new.  Any other program concepts will need to score better than the baseline to justify going forward with them.  We described an initial program concept based on a particular design approach on page 2.  To do a thorough job, we should examine other design approaches to see if they lead to promising concepts.  Given that a single author is contributing this section at present, this will need to be limited in scope to examining approaches already proposed by others.  There is an opportunity here for other individuals or teams to add to this work with additional approaches and concepts.  The important thing is to compare alternatives on a fair basis, using similar goals, evaluation criteria, technology levels, and cost estimating methods.

==Current Parameter Status==

Some of our criteria for comparing programs are scored relative to features of existing civilization, so as a starting point we will identify the current status of these parameters. The initial version of this functional analysis is being written in late 2012, so we will use the start of 2013 as &quot;current&quot;.  If the entire conceptual design process takes a long time, the information should be updated to a new current date. 2015 is suggested for the next update.

===Environment Ranges===

The Temperate range is defined as where 90% of people currently live, and more difficult and extreme environments are respectively &gt; 10% and 20% beyond that.  Analysis of where people live vs environment conditions is being developed separately in the '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Environment_Ranges|Sec 5.2 - Environment Ranges Design Study]]'''. This is being done in two steps due to the mass of detail in mapping out where people live.  The following table lists initial estimates for the boundaries of the Temperate range, and the inner boundary values for the difficult and extreme ranges.  When the second part of the Environment Range study is complete, these will be updated.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Parameter !! Units !! Temperate Low !! Temperate High !! Difficult Low !! Difficult High !! Extreme Low !! Extreme High
|-

|}

==Existing Baseline Program==

Our existing baseline can be defined by looking at world development trends and existing space programs to the point that uncertainties in items like GDP or new technology are larger than 50% of our estimates.  At that point the future is too uncertain to project reasonably, therefore we stop.  Future updates to this kind of conceptual design study, done in 5 or 10 years time, can then project forward to a new uncertainty horizon.  Other program concepts will also have a time horizon bounded by uncertainties, and should explicitly identify what those limits are.  In examining world development and existing space programs, we do not need to examine their every detail, but only the parts that affect the scoring in the evaluation criteria we have chosen.

===World Development Trends===

===Existing Space Programs===

===Evaluation Score===

We take our previous table of evaluation criteria, and apply them to the current baseline:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

==New Program Concept==

Our new program concept was first stated in a general way on page 2.  The basic approach was to enable expansion by developing advanced technologies, then build a series of new locations in more difficult environments, and within each location increase in size and technical performance.  The obvious functional breakdown is then first by level of technology, which defines what is possible to build, then the locations, defined by a set of environment conditions.  As better technology becomes available, the locations are upgraded to targeted size and performance levels.  A &quot;location&quot; is a general environment, such as tropical ocean or Low Earth Orbit.  Selection of specific sites is left to later.  To determine how many phases of upgrades are needed, we will optimize based on what can be reached in a first phase, and what size steps are reasonable.  As a goal, we think a phase should provide at least a 10 point increase in evaluation score, to be significant enough to implement.

The primary functions within a location include production, habitation, and transport capacities.  These allow it to support people at the location, and interact with the rest of civilization.  We will develop functional flow diagrams to model these elements and the flows that connect them to each other and outside the program.


===Expansion Phases===

Our partial evaluation score for existing civilization is about 75 points, so we will attempt to formulate a location concept that yields a total score of 85 for Phase I.  Later will will adjust and optimize this concept.  For now we just want a single example to start with.  Later phases will try to increase in steps of 10 to 105 points in Phase III.  We don't expect to be able to plan beyond Phase III at this early date, since implementing that far in the future involves too much uncertainty.  

====Develop Technology (Phase 0)====

Before we implement the first phase, we have to develop sufficient technology to reach the desired program goals for that phase.  This includes doing conceptual and preliminary design, developing new technologies, and building prototype systems to demonstrate performance.  This preliminary phase we will call Phase 0.  Assuming this phase shows enough gains over the current baseline, we then proceed to the next phase.

'''Conceptual Design'''

'''Preliminary Design'''

'''New Technologies'''

It is not necessary to duplicate work for technologies which already have large efforts in progress.  Thus electronics, for example, is not an area we would put much effort into.  It is already a major industry with high levels of funding for technology development.  Instead we will apply efforts to areas specific to the program, and which are not getting sufficient attention.  The selection of which technologies to work on first will depend on ranking their relative potential impact, development difficulty, and timing of the need for it. 

As a new technology reaches a sufficient level of improvement, it will migrate from this task to prototyping. If it performs well enough, it will then move to one of the later implementation phases.  If more progress appears possible, a given technology goes back into the development cycle, and the amount of effort based again on ranking vs other technologies.  Thus Phase 0 does not end once Phase I starts, but continues as long as there is sufficient improvement possible, periodically feeding new improvements to later locations and phases.

'''Prototype Scaling'''

It is less expensive to build smaller prototypes to try out new technologies and demonstrate performance, so we will establish a series of mass and linear scales derived from the &quot;full scale&quot; level of supporting 75 people/year.  Not everything can be prototyped this way, but it will be used where effective.  Habitation is an obvious example where scaling in all dimensions is not feasible, although scaling in area is possible. The scale steps get smaller as size goes up due to increasing cost. Consistent scaling steps helps ensure different items will work together when integrated.  Initial sizes of prototypes and which scale steps to use will be determined for each technology. There is an opportunity to sell copies of the smaller scale elements, or do initial production and operations with them, as ways of generating income for further growth.

The scales are as follows:

* '''1/10 Scale''' - This is 10% linear, or 0.001 mass and volume, or support 0.075 people/year capacity.
* '''1/5 Scale''' - This is 20% linear, or 0.008 mass and volume, or support 0.60 people/year capacity.
* '''1/3 Scale''' - This is 1/3 linear, or 0.037 mass and volume, or support 2.75 people/year capacity.
* '''1/2 Scale''' - This is 50% linear, or 0.125 mass and volume, or support about 9-10 people/year capacity.
* '''3/4 Scale''' - This is 75% linear, or 0.422 mass and volume, or support about 30 people/year capacity.
* '''Full Scale''' - This is 100% linear, or 1.000 mass and volume, or support 75 people/year capacity.

Later growth may require larger prototypes, and multiple copies of a given size may always be used for more capacity.

An example of scaling is reducing a 36 inch x 21 ft capacity, 30 hp electric commercial sawmill down to 0.5 hp electric (a factor of 60 in power), and reducing log capacity by 2.5 in each axis (a ratio of 15.625 in log volume), giving a total reduction of 937.5, roughly the 0.001 mass and volume scaling for the smallest size. In US terms the log capacity is 15&quot; diameter by 8 ft long or 12&quot; diameter by 12 ft long. The smaller motor is suitable for slower production rates, and the smaller size is suitable for home use.  600 lb log weights can be handled by a single person using leverage at each end singly.

====Develop Phase 1 Locations====

The following program parameters result by working backwards from an 85% score for each evaluation criterion, or 10% higher than the baseline. They are goals, the actual values will be found at the end of the conceptual design.

* '''1.2 Program scale:''' Average population/location = 3000, total population = 150,000.  Number of locations = 50.  We will assume an inverse size distribution where size for the nth largest location is 1/n times the largest location.  For 50 locations the total is 4.5 times the largest. This comes from '''[[w:Zipf's_law|Zipf's Law]]''', an empirical observation for city sizes.  This gives a smallest location of 660 and a largest of 33,000.
* '''2.1 Number of Locations:''' Actual count of locations is 50, giving 50% score.  We compensate by increasing range of environments to 240 steps, giving 120% score.
* '''2.2 Growth:''' 11% per year, giving 9 year time to completion, and 75 people as minimum location design size.
* '''2.3 Improved Technology:''' 85% direct values for local resources, finished products, recycled fraction, automation, and autonomy.
* '''2.4 Quality of Life:''' Equivalent GDP (counting internal production) = $156,000 US
* '''2.6 Resources:''' 10.5 x internal materials and energy over life cycle, or 950% surplus.
* '''4.1 Total Development Cost:''' Allow 11.7x unit cost on Earth, 1.2x in space.  Allows $890,000 development/person for temperate location, +10% per environment step compounded for more difficult locations, and ln(size) for increased size of same environment. 
* '''4.2 New Location Cost:''' Per person = $76,000 Earth, Space = $152,000.
* '''4.3 Earth Launch Cost:''' $23/kg including space resources factor.  Nominal split is $150/kg actual launch cost and 15% non-space resources factor.
* '''5.1 Technical Risk:''' 7.5% technical uncertainty
* '''6.1 New Location Risk:''' Allow 38% casualty risk for new locations
* '''6.2 Population Risk:''' 17% reduction to population risks
* '''7.1 Biosphere Security:''' 178,000 species x locations maintained outside natural range
* '''7.2 Survivability:''' 17% compensation for critical risks

'''Schedule'''

We assume a notional schedule which ramps up gradually.  Assuming a &quot;zeroth&quot; location for prototyping we allow 6.5 years for Phase 0 to develop the technologies, after which the first Earth location starts at a scale of 75 people and grows by 75 per year to 660.  Annual population growth increases by 11% per year, so added locations are started when enough margin over first location exists, until all 50 locations are built, nominally ~50 years.

Technology development is assumed to continue for 6.5 more years to initiate Phase II, and 7 more years to initiate Phase III, so later sites will use upgraded technology, and older sites retro-fitted to improved levels.  Budget for prototype work is $66 million, resulting in ~36 resident capacity.

====Later Phases====

At this point it is too early to try and define later phases in much detail, aside from setting evaluation scores of 95 and 105%.

===Locations List===

This list is tentative pending completion of the environment ranges study.

:* '''Temperate Earth''' - Our first environment is within the middle 90% range of current civilization.  The reason is to first develop improved technology, such as seed factories and cyclic flows, where it is easiest to do the work, and where it will have the widest immediate application.

:* '''Non-Temperate Earth''' - This group has one or more parameters outside the Temperate range, but not reaching the Difficult level.  They are named by whichever parameter is most out of range.  Many combinations are possible.

:: - '''''Hot Locations''''' - These are where summer daytime highs exceed 310K (37C). Death Valley, California, generally considered the hottest place on Earth, reaches 47C for average summer daily high, so no place on the surface reaches the difficult level of 341K (68C) except for volcanic areas.  The TauTona gold mine in South Africa, which reaches 4 km below the Earth's surface, has a rock face temperature of 60C, so it also does not reach the difficult level.

:: - '''''Cold Locations''''' - These are where winter nighttime lows are below 260K (-13C). Vostok Station, Antarctica, is considered the coldest place on Earth, and reaches an average winter low of 201K (-72C).  This is below the extreme low threshold of 208K (-65C), so the Earth includes Non-Temperate, Difficult, and Extreme Cold Locations.

:: - '''''High Water Locations''''' - Nominally these are areas that get more than 2.5 meters (100 inches) of rainfall or other fresh water sources, such as river flow, per year. Since the maximum water supply reaches about 10 meters/year, there are about 14 steps above the Temperate range on Earth, in 10% compounded increments.  Significant tropical areas fall into the Non-Temperate range from rainfall alone, and some areas near major rivers reach the highest values.

:: - '''''Low Water Locations''''' - Nominally these are areas that get less then 0.25 meters (10 inches) of rainfall or other fresh water sources/year.  The driest location on Earth, the Atacama Desert in Chile gets as little as 0.001 meters/year, so there are 10 steps in dryness below the Temperate range, in 0.025 m/yr increments.  Significant parts of the Sahara Desert fall into the lowest step. 

:* '''Difficult Earth Locations''' -  This group of locations push one or more environment parameters more than 10% beyond the temperate range.  Based on our environment parameters, we can start to identify such locations, and then combine ones where multiple parameters can be addressed at once.  All the ranges are based on what the upper and lower 5% of current population live with:

:* '''Extreme Earth Locations''' - This group includes as many locations as needed to push environment parameters to the limits of practicality.  Some parameters may have no practical use beyond a limiting value even if conditions exist beyond them.  

:* '''Near Earth Space''' - These start with the lowest useful Earth orbits at about 200 km altitude and extend upwards to 10% beyond Earth escape energy.

:* '''Distant Space'''

===Functions===

[[File:General_Development_Model.PNG|thumb|right|800 px|Figure 5.1-1 - Generalized development model.]]

Figure 5.1-1 is a very preliminary diagram showing the functional elements and flows for a generic location. Functions must trace back to at least one program goal or requirement, otherwise they are unnecessary. This can be either a direct reference to a source, or an indirect derivation by analysis.  For the elements in this diagram at least one source each that justifies their inclusion are:

* '''Diagram as a whole''' - Multiple locations will make up the total program, so the entire diagram is an element in a higher level diagram.  The need for locations comes from 1.1 Program Goal - &quot;...a series of new locations...&quot;.
* '''Provide Production Capacity''' - comes from 2.3 Improved Technology - &quot;...increase the levels of self production...&quot;
* '''Provide Habitation Capacity''' - comes from 1.2 Program Scale - &quot;...permanently supporting at least 95,000 humans total among new Earth locations and at least 2,000 humans per new space location.&quot;  The physical support to live in a given location we will call Habitation.
* '''Provide Transport Capacity''' - comes indirectly from 1.1 Program goal &quot;...expand human civilization...&quot;.  The new locations are not cut off from existing civilization or each other, therefore they need capacity to transport people and supplies in, and products out.  It comes more directly from &quot;...a series of new locations...&quot;, since the mere existence of new locations requires transport to set them up.

Flows into and out of the diagram, and between functions can contain any kind of hardware, software, data, or people.  Later analysis will define exactly what each flow contains, but they must follow the rule that flows are conserved.  This comes from the physical fact that items do not appear from or disappear into nothing.  Thus dividing or combining flows must sum to the same totals on both sides, and so must inputs and outputs to a function (although a function may convert the types of flows).  Conservation of flows ensures that all inputs and outputs of a system are considered and accounted for.  In this preliminary diagram we merely identify some of the major flows.  

To continue the functional analysis, we break down the three top-level functions into lower level elements.  Partitioning functions into more detailed ones creates logical boundaries inside a larger system.  This then identifies flows which cross the internal boundaries, and creates simpler elements to design.  The lower level functions should have an internal coherence or relatedness.  Since the partitioning is logical, and not physical, it can be done in different ways, and often is to develop alternate designs.  A good understanding of the nature of the system is very helpful in developing the lower level functions, which in turn may require specialist knowledge.

As a start, we can create one list of lower level functions drawn from past experience.  They will likely strongly interact with each other, with many flows between the sub-functions, so a flow diagram may be too complicated to use.  We will consider a table or spreadsheet instead.  We also identify categories of inputs to and outputs from the location as a whole.  A location is connected physically to its environment, and interacts with other locations and civilization as a whole, so flows crossing the location logical boundary are part of the analysis.  The inputs and outputs will then later be divided among the more detailed functions.

==About This Book==
Before we go any further with poetry or high hopes, we'd like to say that this book is for version 2.6 (.3) of Blender. It can be used for earlier versions, but the methods aren't guaranteed to work.

Also we must assume that you have a working knowledge of Blender modelling as this book only covers the Blender Game Engine (also referred to as BGE and GE). For a better Blender knowledge you should look at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]. If you don't have this working knowledge of Blender, fear not! Use the Blend Notes on each page which will tell you how to do stuff and what that word means:

{{BBR/Note|
'''''Blender Notes:''' Notes For The Novice''}}

Some Blender Notes may say '''Blender Note: For Everyone'''. That means that even if you already have Blender knowledge you should look at it.

To wiki editors with Blender experience: please write tutorials with clear names, and sort the pages under one of the headings. If it doesn't fit in any of them you should discuss the page, and in the mean time put the page link at the bottom of the index. We may sort some of the pages later. Please don't put a category in the name of a page. All tutorials should be for 2.6 or better and only for the BGE.

So what do you need to make Blender Games? Here I shall explain:

==Blender For Your OS==
Number one: an OS (operating system). The best would be Linux, Windows, or MacOS. Next you should get Blender. Head to their site at [http://www.blender.org www.blender.org] and then look for the downloads page. Run down the page and find Blender for your OS. Download it and if you need to install, do so.

==Next We Need GIMP==
Not necessarily GIMP. Blender uses a system called UV Texturing. With this you can apply images to objects. To make these images you will need a reasonably good image editor such as [http://www.gimp.org GIMP]. You can also download images from the web, but this may cause a run-in with licensing.

==Other Stuff==

===Story===
You will need an idea. You can play around with tutorials and experiment but if you really want to release a good game you need to have a name, a game play idea and maybe even a story. If you're stumped at this you can use a quick version of [[Beyond Blender Render/Story's The Story|mine]].

===A Good Imagination===
You or someone on your team needs a good imagination. Using this you can imagine the landscape, gameplay, story, and menus of your game. Most importantly this can help with programming your game.

==Why Do You Need A Story?==
You don't NEED a story. It is there to give depth to the game, form a sort of mission. It makes a player want to play on. And it can make it more difficult to create a game. If you don't have a good story take mine and edit a bit to fit your needs.

==Story Is The Heart Of A Game==
Never mind the poetry. Let's get to it:

==More And More About Stories==
If you're good at animating in Blender why not make some cut-scenes. These are small bits of animation that tell you about the story or tell you the way to go. It's always nice to do.

==Drawing Will Draw Up The Game==
If you want to get stuff down before getting to work and forgetting it get a piece of paper a pencil and a clip board. Draw up the GUI (the graphical user interface or menus and HUD), the level maps, the stuff that might count as background. Write stuff up on files you may need, stuff you want, and your Christmas Shopping List. You don't have to get this done before on computer development, in fact you don't even need to do it at all. Just it helps. Remember. The larger the game the harder it will be to remember an make. SO MAKE IT LARGE!

==Discuss, Argue and Fight==
Discuss stuff about the game. Think about what you want in it, special pick-ups, challenges and more. Try to decide on what you all want so as to make sure you don't argue and none of the stuff works. Have a bed fight if you want and this might even end up in the game. Be inventive.

==Ever Commandeered A Rocket Ship?==
It's well known that Blender's GUI looks like a rocket ships controls. Don't be discouraged. Let's get started.

Here's what Blender generally looks like.

[[File:StartWithBlender1.png|center|800px|Blender Rocket Ship: Seriously]]

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

Looks difficult to you newbie? Don't get discouraged. Blender is very easy. Just take it one step at a time. In no time you'll be a Blender Geek yourself!}}

==Start The Logic==
{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

Different edit windows in Blender are displayed in separate panels. You can scale these panels and you can also change what they display be clicking the pull down menu on the far left with an icon in it.}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

To select an object put the cursor over it in the 3D view and '''RIGHT-CLICK''' it. To select two or more objects select one then hold '''SHIFT''' and select the others.}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

To delete an object select it and press '''X'''. Then confirm that you want to delete in in the menu that pops up. If you don't want to delete it when the menu pops up press '''ESC'''.}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

To add an object press '''SHIFT'''+'''A'''. Then select an object in the menu that pops up.}}

Delete all the objects in the 3D view and then add a plane and a cube. In the bottom panel of the Blender window open the &quot;Logic Editor&quot;. The Logic Editor looks like this:

[[File:Logic_window1.png|center|800px|Blender Logic Panel]]

What you see here is the logic. Logic is sort of the BGE programming language. Each object has a logic window. When you select an object it will display the logic for the object.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

To move an object select it and press '''G'''. Then move the cursor wherever you want to move the object. You can also select a certain axis to move it on by pressing the axis letter on the keyboard after pressing '''G'''. To confirm the movement '''LEFT-CLICK'''. To discard the movement '''RIGHT-CLICK'''.}}

Please select the cube. Move it up a bit so it's a bit above the plane. The cube will be our character and the plane will be our ground.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

To scale an object select it and press '''S'''. Then move the cursor so that it scales. You can also select a certain axis to scale it on by pressing the axis letter on the keyboard after pressing '''G'''. To confirm the movement '''LEFT-CLICK'''. To discard the movement '''RIGHT-CLICK'''.}}

Please scale the plane so it's a bit larger then the cube.

So let's start the Logic. Go to the [[Beyond Blender Render/A Simple Start|next tutorial]] to learn how to use basic logic and what physics is for.

      <comment>/* Sufficiency of Count */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Form and Content of a Charge==
An information must provide sufficient detail to identify the transaction which gives rise to the criminal liability so that the accused can make full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Saunders, 1990 CanLII 1131 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1020&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jimmy, [2004] B.C.J. No. 1555&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Gauthier 1995 B.C.J. No. 1527 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R v. Katsiris 2008 BCCA 251&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the charge is particularized beyond the essential elements, the Crown is still bound to prove the transaction delineated in the charge.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Rai, 2011 BCCA 341 at para. 16 referring to s. 581
&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quotation|
'''Substance of offence'''&lt;br&gt;
581. (1) Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain in substance a statement that the accused or defendant committed an offence therein specified.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Form of statement'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The statement referred to in subsection (1) may be
:(a) in popular language without technical averments or allegations of matters that are not essential to be proved;
:(b) in the words of the enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable offence; or
:(c) in words that are sufficient to give to the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Details of circumstances'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.
&lt;p&gt;
...&lt;p&gt;
'''Reference to section'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) A count may refer to any section, subsection, paragraph or subparagraph of the enactment that creates the offence charged, and for the purpose of determining whether a count is sufficient, consideration shall be given to any such reference.
&lt;p&gt;
...&lt;p&gt;
'''Certain omissions not grounds for objection'''&lt;br&gt;
583. No count in an indictment is insufficient by reason of the absence of details where, in the opinion of the court, the count otherwise fulfils the requirements of section 581 and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, no count in an indictment is insufficient by reason only that
:(a) it does not name the person injured or intended or attempted to be injured;
:(b) it does not name the person who owns or has a special property or interest in property mentioned in the count;
:(c) it charges an intent to defraud without naming or describing the person whom it was intended to defraud;
:(d) it does not set out any writing that is the subject of the charge;
:(e) it does not set out the words used where words that are alleged to have been used are the subject of the charge;
:(f) it does not specify the means by which the alleged offence was committed;
:(g) it does not name or describe with precision any person, place or thing; or
:(h) it does not, where the consent of a person, official or authority is required before proceedings may be instituted for an offence, state that the consent has been obtained.
:R.S., c. C-34, s. 512.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec583 CCC]
}}

A count is the specific wording of the charge itself. It sets out the specifics of the allegation.

For a count to be valid under s. 581 it must apply to a single transaction and must contain a statement that the accused committed the offence specified.

A crown cannot join two or more offences into a single count on an information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. City of Sault St. Marie (1978) 2 SCR 256&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Barnes (1975) 26 CCC (2d) 112 (NSCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Duplicity and Multiplicity===
A charge should only set out one offence.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. see s. 789 regarding summary offences&lt;br&gt;
see also s. 581 (&quot;Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain in substance a statement that the accused or defendant committed an offence therein specified.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
At common law, a charge is invalid where it violates the rule rule of duplicity, setting two offences in a single count, and rule against multiplicity, setting out more than two offences in a single count. &lt;ref&gt;
R v Archer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tvld 1955 CanLII 2] (SCC), [1955] SCR 33&lt;/ref&gt;
The purpose of this rule is so that the accused may know the charge against him and, once a verdict is given, that he know what his conviction is exactly for. This is particularly relevant where the accused may later wish to rely upon a plea of autrefois acquit/convict.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City) [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the common law rules against duplicity and multiplicity has been modified to be less stringent. A &quot;double or multifarious&quot; count is a defect in form, but not necessarily void.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Neville, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 434&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cotroni; R. v. Papalia , [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, s. 590 sets out that:
{{quotation|
'''Offences may be charged in the alternative'''&lt;br&gt;
590. (1) A count is not objectionable by reason only that
:(a) it charges in the alternative several different matters, acts or omissions that are stated in the alternative in an enactment that describes as an indictable offence the matters, acts or omissions charged in the count; or
:(b) it is double or multifarious.
R.S., c. C-34, s. 519.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec590 CCC]
}}

In such cases, both the defence (590(2)) or the judge (590(3)) have the ability to amend the count into multiple counts on the information.

The primary test applied is to ask &quot;does the accused know the case he has to meet, or is he prejudiced in the preparation of his defence by ambiguity in the charge?&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City) , [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299 at p. 1308
&lt;/ref&gt;

A charge is not duplicitous because the range of offence dates cover a period of time where the relevant available defence changed in law.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Katigbak, 2011 SCC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Sufficiency of Count==

The indictment should contain “sufficient details to give the accused reasonable information with respect to the charge and to enable the accused to identify the transaction so as to permit the adequate preparation of the defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Douglas, 1991 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 301, 63 C.C.C. (3d) 29 at para. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The information necessary will vary depending on the facts of the case and the nature of the offence.

'''Parties'''&lt;br&gt;
The common law does not generally distinguish between the principle and an aider or abettor for the purpose of the indictment. There is however a distinction between principles and accessories.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Thatcher, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1987/1987canlii53/1987canlii53.html 1987 CanLII 53] (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652&lt;/ref&gt; Counselling can fall within either an accessory or as a aider or abettor.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Fitur and Maldonado, [http://canlii.ca/t/fprx7 2012 MBQB 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Charge Surplusage==
 
Surplusage within the charge refers to non-material or &quot;non-essential averments&quot;. Surplusage need not be strictly proved where the accused is not misled or prejudiced.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Vezina, 1986 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Canadian National Railway Co. 2005 M.J. No. 104 at para. 41 to 42&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amendments to Charges==

Amendments to an indictment are addressed in s. 601: 

{{quotation|
'''Amending defective indictment or count'''&lt;br&gt;
601. (1) An objection to an indictment preferred under this Part or to a count in an indictment, for a defect apparent on its face, shall be taken by motion to quash the indictment or count before the accused enters a plea, and, after the accused has entered a plea, only by leave of the court before which the proceedings take place. The court before which an objection is taken under this section may, if it considers it necessary, order the indictment or count to be amended to cure the defect.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Amendment where variance'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Subject to this section, a court may, on the trial of an indictment, amend the indictment or a count therein or a particular that is furnished under section 587, to make the indictment, count or particular conform to the evidence, where there is a variance between the evidence and
:(a) a count in the indictment as preferred; or
:(b) a count in the indictment
::(i) as amended, or
::(ii) as it would have been if it had been amended in conformity with any particular that has been furnished pursuant to section 587.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Amending indictment'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Subject to this section, a court shall, at any stage of the proceedings, amend the indictment or a count therein as may be necessary where it appears&lt;P&gt;
:(a) that the indictment has been preferred under a particular Act of Parliament instead of another Act of Parliament;
:(b) that the indictment or a count thereof
::(i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite to constitute the offence,
::(ii) does not negative an exception that should be negatived,
::(iii) is in any way defective in substance,
&lt;P&gt;
and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or
:(c) that the indictment or a count thereof is in any way defective in form.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Matters to be considered by the court'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made to the indictment or a count in it, consider
:(a) the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry;
:(b) the evidence taken on the trial, if any;
:(c) the circumstances of the case;
:(d) whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by any variance, error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3); and
:(e) whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be made without injustice being done.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Variance not material'''&lt;br&gt;
(4.1) A variance between the indictment or a count therein and the evidence taken is not material with respect to
:(a) the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed, if it is proved that the indictment was preferred within the prescribed period of limitation, if any; or
:(b) the place where the subject-matter of the proceedings is alleged to have arisen, if it is proved that it arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the court.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Adjournment if accused prejudiced'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Where, in the opinion of the court, the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance, error or omission in an indictment or a count therein, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the misleading or prejudice may be removed by an adjournment, adjourn the proceedings to a specified day or sittings of the court and may make such an order with respect to the payment of costs resulting from the necessity for amendment as it considers desirable.
&lt;p&gt;...
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 601; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 123; 1999, c. 5, s. 23(E); 2011, c. 16, s. 6.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec601 CCC]
}}

Mistakes to heading of indictment will not affect its validity.(s. 601(8))

==Joinder and Severance==
===Joinder===
Under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec591 s. 591(1)], any counts can be joined onto the same indictment. A party may apply to the court join charges on separate informations where the offences relate. &lt;ref&gt;See 9:13012 of E. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada, 2d ed&lt;/ref&gt;. The judge further has the power to hear evidence concurrently on a summary and indictable matter where the offences relate. &lt;ref&gt; See. R. v. Clunas [1992] SCR 595 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1992/1992canlii127/1992canlii127.html 1992 CanLII 27]&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of this is that an otherwise summary offence matter can be tried and disposed of by a Justice of a Superior Court where the offence relates to a indictable matter that the Justice is hearing evidence on.

See also: R. v. Dardon, [http://canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2004/2004abqb146/2004abqb146.html 2004 ABQB 14]

{{reflist|2}}
===Severance of Charges===
A motion to sever co-accused can be brought under s. 591(3)(b) of the Criminal Code:
{{quotation|
'''Severance of accused and counts'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) The court may, where it is satisfied that the interests of justice so require, order
:(a) that the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts; and
:(b) where there is more than one accused or defendant, that one or more of them be tried separately on one or more of the counts.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Order for severance'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) An order under subsection (3) may be made before or during the trial but, if the order is made during the trial, the jury shall be discharged from giving a verdict on the counts
:(a) on which the trial does not proceed; or
:(b) in respect of the accused or defendant who has been granted a separate trial.
&lt;br&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec591]
}}

The &quot;interest of justice&quot; is determined based on the balance of “prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single trial”. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. E. (T.I.), 2012 MBQB 20 at 8&lt;/ref&gt;This includes the interests of those of the accused, the co-accused, and the community as represented by the prosecution.  The trial judge shall weigh the competing interests and will sever only if satisfied that severance is required.  The applicant must overcome the presumption that co-accused who are jointly charged and are said to have acted in concert, should be tried together.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Savoury, 2005 CanLII 25884 (ON CA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2005/2005canlii25884/2005canlii25884.html] at 22&lt;/ref&gt;
The crown has the option to indict the accused separately or jointly, and the discretion so exercised is entitled to great weight.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Handsor, [2005] M.J. No. 79 (QL), 2005 CarswellMan 86, 193 Man.R. (2d) 8 (Q.B.) at 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The factors to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Last, 2009 SCC 45[http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc45/2009scc45.html#par18] at 18&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. E. (L.) 1994 CanLII 1785 (ON CA), (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 228 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 238&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cross 1996 CanLII 5992 (QC CA), (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 410 (Que. C.A.), at p. 419 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Cuthbert 1996 CanLII 8341 (BC CA), (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 9, aff'd1997 CanLII 397 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 8&lt;br&gt;
R. v. E. (T.I.), 2012 MBQB 20 (failed)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* the general prejudice to the accused; 
* the legal and factual nexus between the counts; 
* the complexity of the evidence; 
* whether the accused intends to testify on one count but not another; 
* the possibility of inconsistent verdicts; 
* the desire to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings; 
* the use of similar fact evidence at trial; 
* the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; 
* the potential prejudice to the accused with respect to the right to be tried within a reasonable time; 
* and the existence of antagonistic defences as between co-accused persons
* expense and convenience of witnesses;&lt;ref&gt;Handsor, supra&lt;/ref&gt;

Severance will be granted where:&lt;ref&gt;Handsor, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
* the defendants have antagonistic defences;
* the important evidence in favour of one of the defendants which would be admissible on a separate trial would not be allowed on a joint trial;
* the evidence which is incompetent against one defendant is to be introduced against another, and that it would work prejudicially to the former with the jury;
* a confession made by one of the defendants, if introduced and proved, would be calculated to prejudice the jury against the other defendants; and
* one of the defendants could give evidence for the whole or some of the other defendants and would become a competent and compellable witness on the separate trials of such other defendants.

In this chapter you will learn the basics of the blender game.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

Before you continue please look at the top of the Blender window where there is the pull-down menu titled Blender Render. Click it and select Blender Game. This means that Blender will pick the BGE as the render engine.}}

==Bang, Crash And Scare: What's Up With Physics==
Objects in the Blender Game Engine will require physics settings. Why? The physics controls what happens when two objects meet, whether objects fall and if this object is a certain shape.

[[File:Look At Physics1.png|center|600px|Physics panel]]

[[File:Physics Panel1.png|center|600px|Physics panel]]

This is the properties panel. When an object is selected it will display that object's physics.

Please set the cube's physics to Dynamic in the first pull down menu. This means that the cube will fall, bounce, bounce back and basically act as a normal object in our world beyond the computer. The panel should now look like this:

[[File:Physics Window2.png|center|400px|Dynamic isn't it?]]

==What's Logic?==
[[File:Logic Panel1.png|center|400px|The Logic Brick panel]]

Logic is sort of the programming language for Blender. You have the sensors on the left that activate the controllers in the middle which activate the actuators at the end that do something. To add a brick click add select the type. Do this all along the line then connect them by dragging a &quot;Wire&quot; from the dot at the end and beginning of each brick.

| family = Mustelidae
| size = Total Length: 11 – 22 inches (28-56 centimeters)
Tail Length: 3 – 6 inches (8 – 15 centimeters)
Weight: 3 – 9 ounces (85 – 267 grams) 

| description = Long body with short legs. During the summer months, it is brown with white underside. During the winter months, it turns white, except for the tip of the tail, which remains black year round. 
| similar = The short tailed weasel is very similar, but can be distinguished from the long tailed weasel by size, as the long tailed weasel is larger.
| range = The long tailed weasel is found throughout much of the United States and through northern South America. 
| habitat = This species prefers open areas near water that are covered with tall grass or water. They make their dens from hollowed out logs or tree stumps, rock piles, or by taking over burrows after killing the former occupants.
| diet = The long tailed weasel is primarily a carnivore, feeding on mice. However, it also attacks animals that are much larger than itself, including rabbits, shrews, rats, and poultry. 
| activity = Weasels do not hibernate, and therefore line their dens in preparation for winter.
| reproduction = Females become sexually mature at 3 or 4 months of age. Males do not become sexually mature until 2 years of age. Breeding in July or August, they give birth 7 months after fertilization. Litters of 1 – 10 pups are common and are born in underground dens that are lined with rodent fur. The young are born without fur and are blind; they leave the den after 7 – 8 weeks. 
| lifespan = 1 – 6 years &lt;ref&gt;

| description = The long body and short stub like legs of this species is similar to a weasel. Along with their long body they also have long bushy tail. Their coat is dark brown with a white strip that starts at the base of the stomach and reaches all the way up to the chin. They also have star webbed like feet that enable them to swim. &lt;ref name=CI&gt;{{Citation |year=2009 |title=American Mink |periodical=Conserve Ireland: A guide to Irelands Protected Habitats and Species |url=http://www.conserveireland.com/mammals/americanmink.php |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
| similar =
•	They are distinguished from similar mammals like weasels because of their size. It is bigger in that it is longer and heavier. It is also darker and has a bushier tail than other weasels. 
•	Another similar species is the river otter. The difference is that the river otter is significantly larger than the mink. Also, the tail on the mink is bushy and thick throughout while the tail on the otter widens at the bottom. 
•	In general a distinguishing factor of the mink is its white belly. &lt;ref name=GK&gt;{{Citation |last1=Kirkland |first1=Gordon Jr.|last2=Schmidt|first2=David F. |year=1996 |title=Mustela Vision |periodical=Mammalian Species |issue=524 |pages=1-5 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/ |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| range =
•	This species ranges as far north as Alaska and as far south as Florida.
•	They range as far west as Montana and as far east as Maine.
•	They generally avoid dry states such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. &lt;ref name=NV&gt;{{Citation |last1=Reid |first1=F.|last2=Helgen|first2=K. |year=2008 |title=Neovision Vision |periodical=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
| habitat = 
•	This species is found in generally wet areas including swamps, marshes and along streams and lakes. 
•	They prefer highly vegetated areas where food is abundant. 
•	They generally live in burrowed holes, under rocks or tree roots, and even in homes where beaver or muskrats once lived but deserted. &lt;ref name=NV/&gt;
| diet = 
•	These animals are carnivores:
o	They generally eat small mammals including small birds
o	They also eat crayfish, frogs, and fish. &lt;ref name=SM/&gt; 
| activity = 
•	This species is mostly nocturnal. Generally activity depends on that of their prey.
•	In particular this species is active in the water and can swim easily using their webbed feet.
•	This species is active all year long however during winter or periods of cold activity decreases significantly. &lt;ref name=GK/&gt; 
| reproduction =
•	Mating season for this species is between February and April with most occurring in March.
•	Gestation lasts on average 51 days but can range anywhere from 40 to 75 days.
•	A typical litter is 4 but can range anywhere from 2 to 8.
•	Weaning lasts up until 5 weeks of age.
•	Young stay with their mothers until autumn. They then start hunting at around 8 weeks. &lt;ref name=GK/&gt;
| lifespan =
•	The average life span of a wild mink is around 3 years of age. &lt;ref name=GK/&gt; 
| notes = The American Mink is definitely most known for their fur and are still farmed for it to this day. Although the fur is what makes it famous there are also other qualities that it has that makes it quite an exquisite animal. For one it is considered the cutest of the weasel family which can be easily seen if you find one. Its dark brown, dense looking fur with a white belly is what will distinguish it from others in it family. It has a long bushy tail and short stubby legs. This species can be easily found throughout Minnesota and will generally be found on its own as it is a solitary animal. In order to spot one of these animals you will have to go out at night and search in wet areas such as swamps and marshes. This species likes to swim so you could easily find them in the water where they hunt and travel. Overall, this animal can be quite predatory especially around its young so it is best to avoid areas where they would live such as burrowed holes and trees where other animals have lived.

Range length: 7.28in-8.74in (185mm-222mm)
Range length of tail: 81mm-95mm
| description = The least chipmunk is the smallest of all the chipmunks. In some of the chipmunk population the female are bigger than the male. They have three dark and two light stripes on the face, with five dark and four light stripes along the sides which the middle strip runs all the way to the tail. Their fur colors are orangish-brown and grayish-white. The tail is long and bushy with a pale brown color to it. 
| similar =
| range =
| habitat = They live throughout North America from the Rocky Mountain regions to the western Great Plains. They are also found throughout central and western Canada, and in the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. They prefer more open areas like forest edges and the openings. Some common places are near rock cliffs, river bluffs and open pine stands. The least chipmunk is the most widespread North American chipmunk, both in their geographic range and habitats (Harris, 1999).
| diet = The least chipmunks eat a variety of food which their diet consist of seeds, nuts, berries, fruits, grasses, fungi, snails, insects and possibly some small birds or mammals (Schlimme, 2000). These chipmunks spend most of their time from April through October foraging. Their cheek pouches allow them to carry food items back to their nests and are either eaten or store. They feed on ground, in shrubs or up in the trees and store food underground to use during winter (Harris, 1999). 
| activity = When it’s cold the least chipmunks will climb on trees to keep themselves warm in the sun. They are adept climbers and some of them will make nest high above grounds where their nest are built seasonally. These least chipmunks are most active between the month of April and October. For the summer, their nest will be made from leaves and bark that are in rotting logs and tree cavities. As the winter, their nest will be underground burrows which consist of dried grass, bark, fur, feathers and soft vegetation. Hibernation for the least chipmunks is not as deep as compare to ground squirrels (Schlimme, 2000). Hibernation occurs from October to April and the male enter hibernation first (Harris, 1999). During these winter months and season they often awake to snack on stored food. They are not social except during mating season and during the time they are rearing young. But, when provisioned by humans then they are remarkably tolerant of conspecifics (Schlimme, 2000). 
| reproduction = The males come out from hibernation before the females do and starts to get involve in competition for mates. Individual are sexually mature by 10 months. The mating season starts in April when females begin to come out of hibernation. Gestation usually last about 28-30 days for the least chipmunks (Harris, 1999). Litter size varies between 2 to 6 young and during a breeding season normally there is only a single litter of off springs but are capable of a second litter if the first one is lost. Young are born from April through May and will appear above ground around June to early July (Harris, 1999). Newborns are naked with a pink color, are 50 mm in length and average about 2.25 g. After the 28th days, their eyes will open and fur will not be fully grown until by the 40th day. Some may move the newborn to tree nest after they begin to activity out of the nest (Harris, 1999). As for lactation it’ll last about 60 days and the newborns will be with their mother for up to six weeks or more. The female will choose their nests for nursery while still pregnant. They are often lines with grass and usually located in stumps, under logs, in brush piles, or even rock piles. The location or position of the chosen nest for nursery will be protected from rainfall and runoff for the health and comfort of the newborns after birth. The role of males in the care for off springs is not certain but some indications are that males may help defend the home range of female with off springs, help maintain the nursery nest, and also bring food. (Schlimme, 2000).
| lifespan = The lifespan of these animals has not been reported but are known to be shorter than the Eastern chipmunks, which can live up to 11 years (Schlimme, 2000).

| description = The red fox is a medium size predator and is most common across Minnesota, even in the Twin Cities and suburbs¹. They are cousins to the dog. These red fox have rusty-red coat with white-tipped bushy tail, and black legs, ears and nose. There are also other colors such as nearly solid black, silver-black and red bisected by dark bands that are across the back and shoulder which sometimes this is called a cross fox¹.

| habitat = Red fox live in many ranges of habitat, ranging from forest to open fields and are found throughout Minnesota. They often have den in woodchuck or badger holes found in dense woods¹. Most dens are up to 40 feet and used for nursery because red foxes prefer to sleep in open areas even during the winter time¹.
| diet = They eat rats, mice, rabbits, ground squirrels, birds, snakes, fish, insects, berries nuts, and seeds. Their diet can be flexible from their home habitat². They will also eat fruit, vegetable, fish frogs, and even worms. Among humans, they will mostly eat garbage and pet food. Red fox hide their uneaten food under litter or bury it in holes. They are one of the few predators that actually store food items¹. 
| activity = They tend to be solitary animals and will always hunt alone¹. The red fox are active both during the day and night but likely to hunt during twilight and in the evenings. 
| reproduction = They mate during the winter, February in particular and 52 days before offspring. Newborns are nurse for ten weeks and will be independent in seven months. At birth, their colors are brown and gray. Then a new coat will grow in toward the end of the first month². Both parents care after their young. These red foxes can reproduce at age one.

Average mass: 74.6g (2.63oz)

| description = The Eastern Mole’s body is covered with a thick velvety fur that varied from a color from silver to black to copper. Their short tail is round and almost hairless. As for their feet there are some hairs above or upper portion but naked or hairless below and the feet are quite large. There are web between the toes of each foot which are to help with all the diggings (Gorog, 1999).  They don’t have any eyes or ears. But it’s thought that the poorly developed eye may be effective in detecting light (Gorog, 1999).  
| similar =
| range =
| habitat = These are found from eastern South Dakota, Michigan, southeastern Wyoming, Central Texas, south to the tip of Florida and north to Ontario and New England. There is a small amount of population found in southwestern Texas and in northwestern Mexico. They prefer fields, meadows, pastures and open woodland. 
| diet = Eastern mole most likely eat earthworms and also eat insects and their larvae, some vegetation, and in captivity will eat ground beef, dog food, mice, and small birds. They eat up to 25%-100% of their own weight in food each day (Gorog, 1999). 
| activity = The eastern moles are not solitary. They have high energy requirements and needs a considerable amount of food daily (Gorog, 1999). They can dig up to 4.5 meters in one hour with their powerful forefeet and are good swimmers. Even though they have no vision, they may be able to detect the presence or absence of light. Also their ears are cover by a layer of skin but again, they may be able to detect sounds and vibrations. They probably find their way around and detect prey by the use of their acute and senses of smell and touch (Gorog, 1999). 

| reproduction = The female has a litter of around three to five young after about 44 days and the litters are born anytime from late February through early June. The eastern mole will have only one litter per year. Newborn don’t have any fur and are in a plant-like nest that are in one of the deeper chambers. This is where they will stay until about four weeks old. They will become adult size by three months and can breed at the end of year one.
| lifespan = One captive animal will usually live longer than 36 months but in the wild, these eastern moles likely live less than this (Gorog, 1999).  But their average lifespan is 3 years.

{{TOC right}}

Astronomy, and space exploration by governments, is a large field of research, and there is a lot of accumulated data about objects beyond the Earth.  We will not attempt to reproduce all of that data here, but rather summarize and link to more detailed information. Many of the headings are links to Wikipedia or other detailed articles.  Historically objects have been sorted as a hierarchy of Star &gt; Planets &gt; Moons, which is based on gravitational binding.  Here we take the approach of sorting by available resources, mainly mass, composition, and energy, instead of gravitational dependency.  The point of view is what is there that could be used, rather than the pure science approach of current condition and how did it form.

The inventory is organized by Solar System matter and energy, followed by our Milky Way Galaxy matter and energy, generally in order of decreasing quantities, and without regard to the practicality of using the resources.  Resources outside our galaxy are too far away to be of near-term interest.  Most of our Galaxy also falls into far-term interest, but some of the near portions may become useful given advances in technology, so we include it for completeness.  Descriptions of large scale engineering projects may also involve extra-Solar resources.


==Solar System Matter==

'''History:''' The '''Solar System''', which includes the Sun and all the objects gravitationally bound to it, formed approximately 4.57 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud, likely along with other stars.  Since it formed by gravitational collapse, the original composition of the cloud primarily determined the composition of the Solar System.  Some material has since been lost by strong solar winds during early formation, and weaker solar wind to date, and by gravitational ejection of bodies.  Additionally some Hydrogen has been converted to Helium by the Sun.  The resulting composition found today is noted in the list of major elemental composition by object below.  Aside from the Sun, most of the elements are combined into molecules and minerals which represent local minimal chemical energy.

The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) '''[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ Solar System Dynamics]''' website provides information on most known natural bodies in the Solar System.  Wikipedia also has an extensive '''[[w:List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size|List by Size]]''' of the larger objects.

===[[w:Sun|The Sun]]=== 

* '''Mass''': 1.981 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 333,000 x Earth's mass.  This is all but 0.14% of the total mass of the Solar System.
* '''Mass Balance''': The Sun loses 4.28 million tons/second by virtue of the mass-energy of it's light output, and roughly 1.4 million tons/second due to the solar wind.  It gains an (unknown amount) from comet and other object impacts.
* '''Composition''': The visible surface of the Sun, known as the '''photoshpere''' consists of 74.9% H, 23.8 % He, and 1.3% heavier elements.  Due to the relatively high gravity of the Sun, denser elements have tended to sink to the core.  The bulk composition is estimated at 71.1% H, 27.4% He, and 1.5% heavier elements.  From fusion of H to He, the process by which the Sun generates energy, the core is now roughly 60% He.  Although the heavier elements are a small fraction of the Sun's composition, they still represent about ten times the mass of the rest of the Solar System besides the Sun. 


===The Gas Giants===

Gas Giants are sufficiently massive to have retained a substantial fraction of Hydrogen and Helium, the lightest two elements.  The Solar System has four, which between them have 444.6 x Earth's mass, or nearly all of the mass not included in the Sun.

'''[[w:Jupiter|Jupiter]]''' 

* '''Mass''': 1.899 x 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 317.8 x Earth's mass.
* '''Mass Balance''': Jupiter's mass balance is not available, it would come from atmospheric loss and comet and asteroid impact gain.
* '''Composition''': The atmosphere is about 75% Hydrogen, 24% Helium, and 1% heavier elements.  The total composition is estimated as 71% Hydrogen, 24% Helium, and 5% heavier elements.

'''[[w:Saturn|Saturn]]'''

* '''Mass''': 5.685 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 95.15 x Earth's mass.
* '''Mass Balance''': Not available.
* '''Composition''': Saturn's atmosphere is 96.3% Hydrogen, 3.25% Helium, and 0.45% heavier elements.  The total composition is estimated to be 20-32% heavier elements, and the remainder H and He.

'''[[w:Uranus|Uranus]]'''

* '''Mass''': 8.681 x 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 14.54 x Earth's mass.
* '''Mass Balance''': Not available.
* '''Composition''': Uranus' atmosphere is about 83% Hydrogen, 15% Helium, and 2% Methane.  The total composition is estimated at 0.5-3.7 Earth masses rocky materials, 9.3-13.5 Earth masses ices (water, ammonia, and methane), and 0.5-1.5 Earth Masses H and He.  The '''ices''' would be solids at this distance from the Sun, but in the interior of the planet they are actually hot dense fluids.

'''[[w:Neptune|Neptune]]'''

* '''Mass''': 1.024 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; kg or 17.15 x Earth's mass.
* '''Mass Balance''': Not available.
* '''Composition''': The atmosphere is about 80% Hydrogen, 19% Helium, and 1.5% Methane.  The total composition is estimated at 1.2 Earth masses rocky materials, 10-15 Earth masses ices, and 1-2 Earth masses H and He.


===Objects With Atmospheres===

Every object of sufficient mass and temperature will have some trapped molecules.  For the purpose of this page, we define '''Atmosphere''' to be sufficiently dense to flow, rather than free molecule interactions, and is mostly non-ionized.

'''[[w:Venus|Venus]]'''

* '''Mass''': 4.87 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 0.815 x Earth's mass. Atmosphere = 4.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg.
* '''Mass Balance''': Venus appears to be losing about 16 grams/sec x atomic weight of atmosphere due to solar wind stripping.  Average accretion from comet and asteroid impacts is not available.
* '''Composition''': The atmosphere is about 96.5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 3.5% Nitrogen, with trace compounds.  Because of similarity in density and total mass to the Earth, Venus is expected to have a similar total composition and structure, consisting of a rocky outer portion, and a metallic core.  

'''[[w:Earth|Earth]]'''

* '''Mass''': 5.974 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or exactly 1.000 x Earth's mass. Atmosphere = 5.28 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; kg.
* '''Mass Balance''': Earth loses about 3 kg/s of Hydrogen and 0.05 kg/s of Helium from the upper atmosphere.  A small amount of man-made objects depart the Earth per year.  On the order of 1.25 kg/s of extraterrestrial material of all sizes (dust to dinosaur killing asteroids) accretes.  Therefore as a whole the Earth is losing mass, but the current rate amounts to 40 parts per billion of the total mass over the remaining life of the Earth.
* '''Composition''': The atmosphere contains 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% Argon, variable amounts of water, and trace compounds. The total composition consists of the following major elements: Iron (32.1%), Oxygen (30.1%), Silicon (15.1%), Magnesium (13.9%), Sulfur (2.9%), Nickel (1.8%), Calcium (1.5%), and Aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.  Due to density segregation, the core is 95% Iron and Nickel, while the uppermost layer, the '''Crust''', is nearly all metal oxides. By weight these are oxides of Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, H, C, Ti, and P.   

'''[[w:Mars|Mars]]'''

* '''Mass''': 6.42 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 0.107 x Earth's mass total.  Atmosphere = 24.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; kg.
* '''Mass Balance''': Loss of Oxygen ions due to the solar wind is estimated at 16-35 grams/sec in a 2010 article by Fang et. al., [ftp://rescha.colorado.edu/pub/fang/MarsPapers/Icarus2010.pdf '''Effect of Martian Crustal Magnetic Field on Atmospheric Erosion''']. At this rate the atmosphere would be eroded in 22.5 billion years.  Accumulation from incoming asteroids and meteorites is not available.
* '''Composition''': The atmosphere contains 95.3% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.7% Nitrogen, 1.6% Argon, and trace components.  The total composition is generally a silicate outer layer with a metallic core, with elements by mass roughly in the order oxygen, silicon, iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium.   

'''[[w:Titan_(moon)|Titan]]'''

* '''Mass''': 1.345 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 2.25% of Earth's mass in total. Atmosphere = 9.05 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; kg.
* '''Mass Balance''':  Not available, but considerations are stripping by Saturn's magnetosphere, accretion from small objects, and stripping from larger impacts.
* '''Composition''': The atmosphere is variable by altitude.  Higher levels are 98.4% Nitrogen, 1.4% Methane, and 0.2% trace compounds.  Lower levels are 95% Nitrogen, 4.9% Methane, and 0.1% trace compounds.  Total composition is roughly half silicate core and half ices and likely liquid water at some depth.  The surface appears to be mostly water ice, with variable amounts of Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Methane Hydrate, Ammonia, and Methanol by location.   

'''[[w:Triton_(moon)|Triton]]'''

* '''Mass''': 2.14 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 0.36% of Earth's mass in total.  Atmosphere ~5 x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; kg.
* '''Mass Balance''': Not available.
* '''Composition''': The thin atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen. The solid composition based on density is likely 30-45% water ice, and the remainder rocky core. Surface is 55% solid Nitrogen, 15-35% water ice, and 10-20% carbon dioxide ice.


===Objects Without Atmospheres===

This group includes those without significant atmospheres.  This happens whenever the combination of low mass and temperature allows gas molecules to escape or to be stripped off by Solar wind interaction.  They are grouped by the International Astronomical Union into one planet (Mercury), several dwarf planets, the remaining satellites of the major planets,  a very large number of '''Small Solar System Bodies''' which are further divided into types, and a possible class of '''Rogue Objects'''.  These divisions into groups are more for convenience by orbit location than mass, composition, shape, and internal arrangement.  There is a more or less continuous distribution of all of these properties, including orbits.  Because most orbits are elliptical, and sometimes highly so, a single object can cross several nominal orbit locations.  Wikipedia has a table of '''[[w:List_of_gravitationally_rounded_objects_of_the_Solar_System|Solar system rounded objects]]''' which includes the dwarf planets, larger satellites, and dwarf planet candidates.

====[[w:Mercury_(planet)|Mercury]]====

* '''Mass''': 3.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 5.5% of Earth's mass.
* '''Mass Balance''': Not available.
* '''Composition''': Approximately 70% metallic core and 30% silicate outer layers.

====Dwarf Planets====

Dwarf planets are defined as large enough to have been shaped by gravity (into an ellipsoid), but not so massive as to clear its neighborhood of other objects.  The category was created in 2006 when it was obvious that Pluto was part of the Kuiper Belt region, which contains some objects larger than the former planet.  Currently 5 dwarf planets are officially recognized (1 Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris), and it is expected several hundred to 2000 others will be found as observations of the region beyond Neptune improve.  Objects larger than 838 km in diameter are provisionally classed as dwarf planets, but final status requires they be rounded, and most such objects have not been observed that well yet.

* '''Mass''': Five official dwarfs: 3.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 0.63% of Earth's mass.  Perhaps 10% Earth mass once all outer system objects are discovered.

====Planetary Satellites====

This group of objects is distinguished by being attached to a major planet and not large enough to maintain a significant atmosphere.  The Wikipedia '''[[w:List_of_natural_satellites|List of Natural Satellites]]''' shows the known ones to date, from which Titan (Saturn VI) and Triton (Neptune I) are excluded since they have atmospheres and were listed above.  It is very likely there are additional small satellites orbiting the major planets which have not been discovered yet.  Total mass is around 475 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; kg, mostly in the 4 largest moons of Jupiter and the Earth's moon.  Composition varies by distance from the Sun from rocky (the Moon) to icy.  We group these objects into two classes by size: Large and Small.  The large group are shaped by gravity, and possibly internal heating from radioactive decay or tidal friction from the planet it orbits.  This group are approximately spherical, and would be considered dwarf planets if not orbiting a planet themselves.  The more numerous Small group are irregular in shape and likely not differentiated by internal melting.

====Outer System Objects====

The outer system includes objects outside the orbit of Jupiter, but not the outer planets themselves or their associated satellites. In approximate order of semi-major axis (symbol a, in AU) this includes the '''Centaurs''', '''Kuiper Belt''', '''Scattered Disk'''', '''Hills Cloud''', '''Oort Cloud''', and '''Rogue Objects'''.  There is overlap between these groups and with asteroids. The distinctions are based on convenience in describing their orbits and composition rather than a real difference in type.  They are all objects not attached to a major planet with orbits beyond Jupiter and too small to maintain a permanent atmosphere.  All the outer system objects are presumed to form from the same solar disk which formed the planets, but were then scattered by the gas giants once they grew massive enough.  '''[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/download.html Comets II]''' and '''[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/ssbn2008/download.html The Solar System Beyond Neptune]''' are recent reviews of the state of knowledge for some of these objects.  

The total mass of all the outer system objects is poorly known and is an active area of study.  Density and spectra indicate the outer system objects as a whole consists mostly of Hydrogen-bearing ices: Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and Water (OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are all solids at large distances from the Sun.  Comets are former outer system objects whose orbit now comes closer than Jupiter to the Sun, so that gas evaporates off their surface, thus they are listed below.  The remainder stay cold enough to be solid.

* '''[[w:Centaur_(minor_planet)|Centaurs]]'''

These are objects which have closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) between Jupiter and Neptune, and no limit on the farthest point.  Approximately 200 are known as of 2012, and are being discovered at about 15-20 per year.  The discovered ones range in size from 200 down to 2 km in diameter.  Estimated number larger than 1 km in size is 44,000.  Because they cross the orbits of the gas giants, their orbits are unstable on a scale of a few million years.

* '''[[w:Kuiper_belt|Kuiper Belt]]'''

The Kuiper Belt includes objects in stable orbits outside the orbit of Neptune (30 AU) up to 50 AU, having eccentricity generally from 0 to 0.2, except for resonant objects which can go to about 0.4, and with inclinations up to about 35 degrees.  Pluto is now considered the largest such object, and 1241 such '''[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/t_tnos.html Trans-Neptune Objects]''' (TNOs), as they are also known, have been found since 1992.  Estimated number of TNOs larger than 100 km diameter is 0.1 million, &gt;10 km possibly as high as 10 million. Estimated mass is 0.04-0.1 x Earth's mass, but models of planet formation predict there were 30 Earth masses of such objects originally.  Where the rest went in that case is unknown at present.  Composition in general is poorly known, but a combination of CH4 (methans), NH3 (ammonia), and H2O (water) ices are expected from the small number of density and spectral observations.

* '''[[w:Scattered_disc|Scattered Disk]]'''' 

Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs) have perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) beyond Neptune (ie 30 AU) with higher eccentricity (0.20 to 0.94) at a given distance, and extending to larger distances than the Kuiper Belt. Their inclinations range up to about 40 degrees. The rise in eccentricity with distance may be a selection effect, since we can only find objects that come closer to the Sun. Outer system objects observed from Earth dim as the 4th power of distance.  This is the product of solar intensity, which falls as the square of distance, and angular area, which also falls as the square of distance. The name comes from their orbits being gravitationally scattered by the gas giant planets at some point in their history from the lower inclination and eccentricity of the Solar nebula from which they formed.  Their orbits are subject to further changes from planet interactions, so are not stable over the long term.  Since 1995, a total of 167 '''[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/t_centaurs.html SDOs]''' have been found (in that table, the ones with q &gt;30 AU). Their total mass is estimated at 0.01-0.1 Earth Mass.

* '''Hills Cloud'''

The Hills Cloud, also known as the Inner Oort Cloud, are objects with semi-major axes between 1,000 and 10,000 AU.  The Sun is expected to have formed in a star cluster embedded in a gas cloud.  '''[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.5114.pdf Computer simulations (2011)]''' of such clusters indicates objects forming closer to the Sun would be scattered out to these distances and into the outer Oort Cloud with an efficiency of ~1.5%, leading to an estimate of ~3 Earth masses currently.  The Hills Cloud is bound strongly enough to the Sun that perturbations from outside sources and the gas giants rarely put them in orbits where we can detect them.  Their large distance makes them too dim to see except when they approach closest to the Sun.  Thus we have only discovered a few objects on orbits which enter this region.  

* '''[[w:Oort_cloud|Oort Cloud]]'''

The Oort Cloud is made up of objects with semi-major axis &gt; 10,000 AU.  At such great distances from the Sun, their orbits are affected by close star passes and galactic tides.  Their origin may partially be capture of loose objects in the cluster where the Sun formed.  The remainder would be highly scattered from the solar disk during the Sun's formation. Estimated mass may be 0.1-7 Earth masses, consisting of about 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; objects.  This estimate comes from observing the frequency of long period comets, but this does not place strong limits on their number.

* '''[[w:Rogue_planet|Rogue Objects]]'''

Rogue objects, also called nomads or rogue planets, are not bound to the Sun and merely passing nearby.  None have been definitely identified in our vicinity, but in 2011 some candidates in our galaxy were discovered through gravitational microlensing.  Since Solar System objects have been ejected by the gas giants, by symmetry there should be objects ejected from other stars which are currently near the Sun. In addition to ejected objects, objects that formed separate from stars by the same mechanism are expected.  Total numbers are very uncertain, with estimates from 2 to 100,000 such objects per star, including our own.

====Inner System Objects====

This group includes objects from the orbit of Jupiter inwards.  It is listed after the outer system objects because this is a resource-based inventory, and the total mass is smaller. In decreasing distance from the Sun it includes:

* '''Jupiter Trojans'''

There are stable '''Lagrange Points''' located 60 degrees ahead and behind a smaller body orbiting a more massive one.  The most massive such pair in the  Solar System, Jupiter and the Sun, has the strongest such stable regions, extending about 30 degrees of Jupiter's orbit each.  Objects trapped there are called '''Trojans''' because the first few found were named after mythical characters from the Trojan War. As recently as 1961, only 14 Jupiter Trojans had been discovered, but by 2012 the [http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/JupiterTrojans.html Minor Planet Center] lists over 5300. There are estimated to be 0.1-0.3 million Trojans larger than 2 km diameter.  Total mass and composition are poorly known at present, but can very roughly be estimated at 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; kg.  A relatively small number of similar Trojan objects exist around other mass pairs.

* '''Main Belt Asteroids'''

About 600,000 total asteroids are known in the Main Belt which ranges from 1.3 AU minimum distance to Jupiter's orbit.  The dense region of the Main Belt has a doughnut-shaped volume of about 70 AU^3, and so an separation of 0.05 AU, or 7,300,000 km.  The number of known asteroids has increased by 60 times since 1980, and is expected to continue growing, but newly found ones are generally small. The total mass in this region is estimated at 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; kg (0.05% of Earth). Total number larger than 1 km is roughly 1 million, and &gt;100 meters ~25 million.

* '''[[w:Near-Earth_object|Near Earth Objects (NEOs)]]'''

These are defined as all objects which have a closest approach to the Sun of less than 1.3 times the Earth's distance (1.3 AU), with the exception of the Sun itself, Mercury, and Venus.  Mars has an average distance of 1.52 AU, but is lower mass than the Earth. The 1.3 AU definition is thus approximately closer to the Earth than outer planets from a gravity standpoint, or close enough to be interesting. This is an artificial definition from a human interest standpoint - there is no distinct physical grouping for this class of bodies, such as there is for the Main Belt asteroids.  NASA has a [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html Near Earth Object Program] to discover and characterize them, and as of mid-2012 there are about 9000 known.  Estimated number &gt;1 km size is around 1000, and &gt;100 m is about 200,000.

The NEO category includes all object types, including asteroids, comets, extinct comets (which can be hard to distinguish from asteroids), and manufactured spacecraft.  There is an undefined lower bound to size, which we will assume to be 1 meter diameter, below which we refer to them as meteoroids, dust, or particles. The population of NEOs is not permanent. Over periods of approximately 1-10 million years either gravity effects from planets and larger bodies, or collisions with them, will remove them from the NEO orbit range. Objects smaller than approximately 1 cm are also affected by light pressure or other effects more than gravity interactions, and have even shorter lifetimes in those regions.


====Comets====

Comets differ from the solid objects listed previously in that they show periodic vaporization and dust emission.  This is caused by heating of their surfaces when they get close to the Sun.  Water sublimation becomes strong at less than 2.5-3 AU, and other volatiles at other distances.  The lost material can create spectacular though not very massive tails.  Since comets are in effect boiling gases from their surface, the built up pressure can cause them to fragment. Their lives are limited by the amount of volatiles they start with.  Defunct comets resemble asteroids, and distinct trails of debris in their orbits are observed as periodic meteor showers. Comets ultimately originate in the Oort Cloud, and migrate to closer orbits by gravitational perturbations.  

Comets are divided by their orbits into '''Short Period''', '''Jupiter Family''', '''Halley Family''', and '''Long Period''' classes.  Typical orbit changes in terms of semi-major axis are about 0.001 per orbit.  If there were no planets around the Sun, the comet orbits would tend to stay fixed.  Since Jupiter is roughly 1/1000 the mass of the Sun, it can be thought of as a blender blade mixing up the orbits by that amount per pass.  Therefore comet orbits tend to randomly migrate among orbit classes.

'''Jupiter Family'''

Since Jupiter is by far the most massive planet in our Solar System, it has the most influence on comets which cross it's orbit.  There is a noticeable cluster of comets whose maximum (aphelion) distance (Q) from the Sun is close to that of Jupiter (5.2 AU).  The cluster roughly ranges from 4.2 AU &lt; Q &lt; 11 AU, with minimum (perihelion) distance (q) ranging from 0.5 AU &lt; q &lt; 5.5 AU.  This range is generally just outside that of the main Asteroid Belt.  Jupiter family comets generally have inclinations less than 35 degrees. Approximately 200 Jupiter Family comets are known.

'''Halley Family'''

This group of comets have orbits with periods of 20-200 years which are oriented so that Jupiter does not affect them strongly.  Their inclinations range from 0 to 180 degrees, with a slight excess below 60 degrees.

'''Long Period'''

These are defined by having an orbital period &gt; 200 years, and thus a semimajor axis (a) &gt; 34 AU.  Long period comets strongly cluster in semi-major axes near 10,000 AU, which makes them hard to distinguish from parabolic.  This cluster of orbits led to the assumption of the Oort cloud as their source.  Their inclinations span the full range from 0 to 180 degrees.

'''Current Energy Output''' From fusion of hydrogen to helium 

'''Estimate Energy Reserves'''

:* Hydrogen Fusion
:* Additional Fusion Reactions
:* Stored Thermal Energy
:* Gravitational Collapse Energy
:* Minor Energy Reserves - Spin, stratification, magnetic field 

===Everything Else===

Everything else is lumped under one heading because magnitude of the Sun's energy reserves is so much larger than everything else combined.

'''Latent Heat of Formation''' -  When massive objects like planets formed within the Solar System, the collision and gravity well energies, and later the stratification of the interiors by density released a lot of energy, part of which went to heating the interior of the object.  For the larger objects, some of that heat is still stored in their interiors.

'''Nuclear Fission''' - Objects in the Solar System incorporated elements with radioactive isotopes which decay naturally, heating their interiors, or can be made to fission on purpose. 

'''Nuclear Fusion''' - Just like the Sun, but on a smaller scale, there is potential energy in light elements that can be fused together.  Since it takes at least 75 Jupiter masses for this to happen naturally, then it must be made to happen artificially.

'''Chemical Reactions''' - Materials such as fossil fuels and undecayed plant matter can burn with oxygen in the atmosphere to release energy

'''Orbital Kinetic Energy''' - The bulk of the kinetic energy in the Solar System resides in the motion of the planets and smaller bodies.  When spacecraft use a flyby to alter their motion, they extract a little of this energy.

'''Minor Energy Reserves''' - 


==Galactic Matter==

'''The Galaxy or Milky Way''' in capitalized form refers to the gravitationally bound object which the Sun and Earth orbit within.  In lower case, '''galaxy''' refers to the general class of such objects.

Components sorted by Mass:

====Stars====

====Satellite Galaxies====

====Clusters====

====Clouds====

====Central Black Hole====

====Substellar Objects====

:'''Brown Dwarfs''' - 

These are objects too small to count as stars, but above the limit for planetary bodies.  The upper limit is about 80 times Jupiter's Mass, above which hydrogen fusion can happen and the object is considered a star. The lower bound is about 13 times Jupiter's mass, below which no fusion will occur.  Above this lower limit, Deuterium and Lithium fusion can happen, but since these are much rarer than Hydrogen, it limits their life and brightness.

:'''Planetary Systems'''

In recent years a large number of planetary systems around other stars have been detected.  The '''[http://exoplanet.eu/ Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]''' catalogs them with references to original papers.  As of 2012 there were 660 such systems with 837 planets detected. Methods of detection vary.  In addition to planets which have formed, '''Circumstellar Disks''' represent early stages of formation or incomplete condensation to larger objects.

:'''[[w:Rogue_planet|Rogue Objects]]'''  

These are objects not tied to a star, which can range from planets below the brown dwarf limit down to ejected comets. They are currently not well understood, as only a few candidates have been '''[http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3544v1 detected]''' by gravitational lensing in 2011.  '''[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.2687v1.pdf Estimates]''' of their number range from two per main sequence star up to potentially 100,000 per star.  The larger number depends on optimistic assumptions for the mass function (number of objects vs their mass).

== World Catalog Stamps - How to use or make template for Stamps List ==


[[User:Khalakmu|Khalakmu]] ([[User talk:Khalakmu|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Khalakmu|contribs]]) 00:41, 8 March 2012 (UTC)
hi QU,
I would appreciate if somebody can show me how to use templates here. Or making 
templates for Stamps List. I  have seen some for USA and USSR. My intentions is to 
make of this template and upload that list, also intend to upload single Image of
India stamp from my collection 1947 to to date.
Image file uploaded in which section, before linking png file ?

:Hello, to upload a file you click on the &quot;upload file&quot; link which you will see in the &quot;Toolbox&quot; on the left of the screen. This will take you to Wikimedia Commons to upload the file. Make sure you choose the right license. Once the file is uploaded you add &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:yourfilename.png|thumb|right|the file description]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page to include the image. The easiest way to create a template is to base it on one that you've seen that is close to what you need. If you can tell me where you have seen a template that you would like to copy then I can point you to how to make a new one based on it. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:09, 9 March 2012 (UTC)

== Importing ==

I just put in 3 import requests and a few strange things happened.  First, the imports said done but they were on a transwiki, not on the page that I requested.  Second, the imported pages look different than the original wikipedia page (a lot of text and images are missing).  Also, when I tried to move the text to the page that I wanted and de-wikify it, I could not save because the spam filter was blocking me.  Please help me figure this out.  [[User:Fountain Pen|Fountain Pen]] ([[User talk:Fountain Pen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fountain Pen|contribs]]) 21:20, 11 March 2012 (UTC)

:Normal practice is to import pages into the Transwiki namespace, edit them there then move them into the main space. Normally, as you specified the final destination you wanted, I would import them into the main space. However, one of the destinations you listed already exists ([[Ancient History/Human Evolution/Recent African Origin]]. I can't just overwrite the existing page so I was asking you to confirm what exactly you wanted to happen. If you would like the imported page to replace the existing page it will need deleting and history merging. I can do this if that's what your intention is.

:If the images are missing then they are not stored on Wikimedia Commons. Images are either stored locally (e.g., at Wikipedia or Wikibooks) or centrally at Commons. The articles that were imported clearly have locally stored images at Wikipedia. You will need to identify these then migrate them from Wikipedia to Commons in order for them to be usable here. If you don't know how to do this then just leave the images as &quot;red links&quot; and someone else will eventually do it for you. As for the spam filter, there must be URLs in the page that are blocked at Wikibooks. The filter should tell you which one it is so that you can delete itIf there is text missing it must be incorporated in Wikipedia via a template. If you can indicate an example of what is missing I can check.  &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:05, 11 March 2012 (UTC)

::Thank you for clarifying the issues with the transwiki and the images, and I have yet to check on the spam filter issue.  However, I'm still not sure about the missing text.  If you compare the [[Transwiki:Recent African origin of modern humans|transwiki]] with the [[w:Recent African origin of modern humans|Wikipedia Article]], all of the headings are different, and all of the text is subsequently different.  I'm not sure exactly why this happened. [[User:Fountain Pen|Fountain Pen]] ([[User talk:Fountain Pen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fountain Pen|contribs]]) 20:56, 12 March 2012 (UTC)
:::It's a bug in the import process. The original import failed with an error message, so I submitted it again. It looks the original import eventually finished. The net result was that there was a partial import of the revisions leaving the page as it was several months ago. If you look in the history the current WP revision is about the third or fourth revision back in the history. I've edited the page to bring the right revision to the front so they should now match Wikipedia &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:34, 12 March 2012 (UTC)

== Reviewer status ==

Hello QuiteUnusual, I am Raymond Sutanto. How I get a reviewer status here? Are there any requirements? In addition, I am a trusted user in Indonesian wikipedia ([http://id.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Istimewa:Daftar_pengguna&amp;limit=1&amp;username=RaymondSutanto proof]) and an admin in Indonesian wikibooks ([http://id.wikibooks.org/wiki/Istimewa:Daftar_pengguna/sysop proof]) [[User:RaymondSutanto|RaymondSutanto]] ([[User talk:RaymondSutanto|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RaymondSutanto|contribs]]) 23:12, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
:Reviewer status is automatically granted when certain criteria are met - the details are on the [[Wikibooks:Reviewer|Reviewer]] page. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:26, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

Hello QU, I'm a Twilight fan, and I noticed the pages are under quite a bit of attack recently - for example the last edits added the word &quot;gay&quot; when the series does not deal with that subject at all. As I have limited time to explore and learn how to properly fix these kinds of slurs and insults, I thought I'd pass the info along to someone who could fix it, and probably much faster than I ever could. Cheers, Kierne````

== Response to your message ==

I've read a lot of material on Wikibooks. It was my understanding that anyone could close a discussion, which apparently isn't the case. I've read sections of different policies, but the site is very difficult to navigate when searching for things such as rules and or guidelines. When reading the section under the community side panel focused on Guidelines, most of the content is very difficult to read and understand. Coming from a user with a degree in computer science, I deal a lot with end users and for someone with my credentials to be confused with such a &quot;low level&quot; (no, saying something is low level isn't an insult. It's a reference to the target user group and the targeted groups ability.) web technology is anything but helpful. If you ask me, (which you didn't ask, but I will share my thoughts regardless in efforts to help the community) the Rules and Guidelines need a massive overhaul. They are hard to navigate from section to section, and the grouping is messy. 
As far as a deletion heavy stance, a majority of the content I read, is in one of my fields of expertise. Those fields being computer programming, medicine, and music. As far as my recent deletion request goes, I find it very very disturbing, that there is no policy on requiring an author to provide credentials on certain topics which are considered &quot;life or death&quot;...especially medicine. Though, my recent tag for deletion was because there was no content posted in a years time, and there havent been any attempts to add content that I could find. [[User:Msaikens|Msaikens]]
:Fair enough, as I said I was more curious than anything. As for the policies, yes it is all a mess and impossible to navigate. I actually thought anyone could close an RfD until I checked because it seemed illogical (closing as a Keep is fine but closing as a Delete for a non-admin is problematic because the closure can't action the delete). Main problem here is lack of contributors and lack of administrators (which follows from the former) meaning that a handful of people have to do everything - e.g., I finally got round to closing three featured book nominations today that have been outstanding for months. I agree on the &quot;risky&quot; books absolutely and don't think we should publish unreferenced, unvalidated material with no experts to review them. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:15, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

== CU discussion and unregistered voter ==
I have checked and there is no requirement that a user should be registered to participate in that discussion (and vote). The CU text on [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] should also be updated to reflect the requirements imposed by meta and point to the relevant information.

The [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] does not cover voting and there is no separated established procedure that covers this type of discussion. Even the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] that defines procedures for registered Wikibooks users does not block unregistered users participation.

The issue is that we do not cater for votes on Wikibooks and so the meta requirements have no real ground on our policies, since the process is being guided by a meta dictate the meta rules should be applied...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:06, 22 March 2012 (UTC)

:Yes I thought the same. Broadly it's down to the Steward to weight the result within the meta policy as it stands. On most projects IP &quot;votes&quot; are discounted as they could be disguising socks or banned vandals (for example) but meta doesn't appear to have the same guidelines. Not fussed really, we'll see what the result is at the end - &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:56, 22 March 2012 (UTC)

:: The fact this is a vote is down to Meta policy, not Wikibooks policy.

:: Re which votes &quot;count&quot;: Fwiw, I'll try, as best I can atm (practice makes perfect, so I expect I'll eventually get better at it), to articulate my position.  As I see it, the position y'all are advocating amounts to denial that Wikibooks should be an independent project.  The issue is more obvious on Wikinews.  There is an aggressive faction on Wikipedia that really hates Wikinews and would frankly like to shut it down.  In our deliberations, outsiders are welcome to express their opinions non-disruptively but their &quot;vote&quot; carries no weight.  Wikinews wouldn't continue to exist if we didn't do that.  I take it for granted that Wikibooks wouldn't have to be nearly as harsh about it as Wikinews, because frankly Wikinews is serving its other non-Wikipedian sisters by drawing fire and thus reducing the degree of negative attention to the others.  But the '''spirit''' of the meta policy on CU votes is not served if people are counted who actually aren't members of the Wikibooks community.  Nor ''should'' such people be counted:  Allowing CU on a project is a very &quot;personal&quot; decision for the project, it goes to the very identity of the community (yes, the words ''personal'' and ''identity'' have remarkably literal senses there), and should be made by people who are actually part of the community.  An IP, or a registered user who has never edited on Wikibooks, might be someone who has been reading Wikibooks for years, they ''might'' even be someone who has been editing Wikibooks anonymously for years (though assuming that in such an intimate context is going a bit far), but by not participating under a recognizable identity, the '''community''' is precisely what such a person has '''not''' been part of.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:25, 22 March 2012 (UTC)
:::My friend, I agree with you - completely. I'm just trying to do what's best for Wikibooks (I don't think anyone would question that I put a lot of effort into this project). I'm completely relaxed about how we approach discussions, elections, policy changes and would like it to be focused entirely on what the community wants. Just in this one case I was trying to juggle between that and the meta policy. Regarding this particular &quot;vote&quot; the majority of the active community have participated and are in support. To be honest if even one of the regulars says no then I wouldn't want to do it anyway. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:31, 22 March 2012 (UTC)
:::: True, realistically the consensus of the community is already quite clear, and at this point it is a matter of being quite sure, before going to meta to say &quot;please turn on the bit&quot;, that we're making it easy for ''them'', by presenting evidence of policy-satisfying consensus that doesn't require any controversial judgement calls.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:48, 22 March 2012 (UTC)

==Questions==

Hey QuiteUnusual,

I have a few questions:
:How can I make a page &quot;stable&quot;?

:It seems I am given the option to review what I've worked on to make it visible. Is that allowed?

:I know the policy on referencing was very liberal some years ago; have there been any changes in how much or how well to reference a wikibook? With regards to the book I'm working on, most of the information is non contentious, but I would like your input on this.

Thank you. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 13:04, 23 March 2012 (UTC)

:Hello, I love your new book by the way. Configuring a page to always show the stable version by default can only be done by an administrator. Reviewing a page can only be done by a [[Wikibooks:Reviewer|reviewer]]. Once a page has been reviewed for the first time then changes are hidden from any reader who chooses to view stable versions by default in their preferences. The changes remain hidden until a reviewer accepts them. You were promoted automatically to reviewer today (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AListUsers&amp;username=Theornamentalist%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8E&amp;group=&amp;limit=1 here])

:You can review your own changes, yes.

:The rules on referencing are non-existent. There's no need to reference the material in your book.

::Thanks for the advice, I am trying out a &quot;did you know?&quot; section which I may reference somewhere. Is there a format, talk page template, or should I create a separate page for references?

:::Not sure about templates,etc., I'll take a look around. There's no obvious way to flag a page for attention, however, you can quickly check if all have been configured by looking [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AConfiguredPages&amp;namespace=110&amp;stable=1&amp;restriction= here] which lists all pages configured to be &quot;stable&quot; by default and [[Special:ValidationStatistics]] which shows any unreviewed pages. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:46, 23 March 2012 (UTC)

== [[The Computer Revolution]] ==
That project is a great mess, at this time unfixable since no order or flow can be enacted (I've attempted but it soon degenerated).

== History Merge at Abstract Algebra... ==

We seemed to have a small collision of editing about the history merge.  I was just writing a note at the talk page that, it appeared to me no merge ever took place.  It seems Arydye001 had created a sort of sub-TOC that had nearly (but not quite) the same content as on the Main-TOC. The intent seemed to be to have a separate chapter TOC, but may my reading of the history is a bit off.  I am rather rusty.

== Youtube ==
I have haded some videos to the [[Hypnosis]] work, my understanding is that there isn't really a guideline on this. I have pondered if they should be excluded from the print versions. Should we assume that print removes web connectivity? Is so is the information still relevant? Because it is simply an aid, not really required to explain the subject (even if that also is not objected, I'm inclined to see it as something negative).&lt;br&gt;
Should the links be done in any special and consistent way ? (taking in consideration what was said about inter work/project links)&lt;br&gt;
What is you opinion on these issues ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:54, 15 April 2012 (UTC)
:I guess I would consider &quot;printed&quot; to also mean rendered as a PDF or HTML and read electronically meaning an external link would still work. So I don't there's a technical reason to exclude Youtube links. Agreed it could be seen as negative. However we have other books with Commons hosted audiovisual media (e.g., .ogv and .ogg files) and nobody seems to mind about these. As for special format, I haven't got a view really. Possibly a template that provided alt text if the link wasn't available would be useful similar to the alt-text used in images. It would also enable the long Youtube URL to be hidden (which is probably counterproductive for a printed version actually). &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:36, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

== Reason for reverting changes ==

The page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Analysis_Tools has a section called &quot;API Monitors&quot; with an entry for a single product. I added a link to another API Monitor (developed by me) with a short description. I see that you reverted the changes. Why is that? Did I violate any rules?
[[User:Rohitab|Rohitab]] ([[User talk:Rohitab|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rohitab|contribs]]) 23:09, 31 May 2012 (UTC)

:Adding a link to a web site that shares the same name as your user account smells of spamming, so I reverted it... As you admit you developed the tool, then it looks like a clear cut case of advertising. I suggest your propose adding the change on the book's talk page instead so other editors can assess whether the link is a valuable addition. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 06:51, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

::The page is full of links to products. The API Monitor section had a single product, so I added mine. I wasn't trying to hide the fact that I was the developer. So, what you're saying is that if someone else posted the link instead of me, it would not be considered advertising? I guess it would have made more sense to have lied and posted under a different name, huh? The link that I posted is one of the best API Monitors in the market. It's free and I don't make any money from it. Half the products listed on the page are paid products. BetaNews wrote an article on it yesterday: http://betanews.com/2012/05/30/api-monitor-2-0-may-only-be-alpha-but-it-gets-the-job-done/. I'm not going to waste my time trying to convince you or others if it's a valuable addition or not. I've given you the facts; if you want to revert it, go ahead. If not, doesn't really matter to me. I'm not the one that is going to benefit from using it.[[User:Rohitab|Rohitab]] ([[User talk:Rohitab|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rohitab|contribs]]) 20:55, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

:::Self promotion is as slippery sloop, and we must be vigilant. One link added today may contain other information tomorrow.

== Heading 3 ==

Hi,

Thanks for cleaning up the A-Level Computing pages. I have a small concern though, as you are changing several of the heading 3s to heading 2s.  The reason for using heading 3s is so the structure of the book will be represented when I bring all the pages together.  Heading 2s will only appear on the final page that brings all the material together.  take a look at: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA/Print_version/Unit_2  to see what I mean.  All other pages  will use heading 3s as they sit under the heading 2s.  Thanks [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] ([[User talk:Pluke|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pluke|contribs]]) 23:22, 24 June 2012 (UTC)

== A question of references ==

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], we have a number of places where we use statements made by the author on her web site. The problem is that Rowling has changed her web site, and the references are all now dead links. What is the preferred way of handling this? I can create references to archived copies of the pages using an external source like [http://archive.org The Wayback Machine], or I can put the specific text in a reference along with where and when it was collected. Which is preferable? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:27, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

:I often use the web archive (The Wayback Machine) for dead links as it permits the reader to benefit from the WEB linkage in case the information is related to what is being provided here, on the other hand if the information is only referential (not necessary beyond simply referential sourcing) then the last option may suffice as the link has no other intrinsic benefit.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:43, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

== Transwiki vs Import ==

Thanks for the note about [[w:Geordie dialect words]].  This was my first attempt at moving something from one wiki to another, and it was extremely confusing.  Can you explain what the difference between the two processes is?  I'm still not very clear on it. [[User:Torchiest|Torchiest]] ([[User talk:Torchiest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Torchiest|contribs]]) 02:02, 17 August 2012 (UTC)
:In the past it wasn't technically possible to automatically move content between projects. The Transwiki process is a legacy of this situation. It provided a way of manually tracking where the content had come from. Someone would paste the material into the Transwiki namespace, copy and paste the revision history onto the talk page, and then move the page into the mainspace. This meant you could link back to the redirect in the Transwiki namespace to find the talk page with the revision history. Now it is possible to import. This brings across the whole page and its history (usually, sometimes it can't all be moved for technical reasons) as if the page had been written here originally. This ensures all the original authors contributions can be seen in the page. To all intents and purposes the Transwiki process is obsolete and only used if an import can't be done. For example, if you wanted to bring across a page from the German Wikipedia and translate it, we'd have to use Transwiki instead of Import. All the main English projects, including Wikipedia and Wikiversity, can be imported. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:36, 17 August 2012 (UTC)

== Thanks for welcoming me to Wikibooks! ==

Now I have a question that I'm hoping you can help me with.  I'm working on the handbook for WMF and we decided that the best place to put it is in Wikibooks.  In Wikibooks it can be printed easily (because, technically, a handbook should go in one's hands), and we want it to be available for the public to view which goes along with the Foundation's general attitude of being as transparent as possible.  

I am creating a collection for the handbook including books on the Culture of Wikimedia, the importance of listening to the Wikipedia community, etc.  A couple books in the collection will need to be locked because they contain legal policies which cannot be edited like employee time-off and legal US holidays, medical plans, etc.  Is it possible to lock those books?

:The books can be fully protected so only administrators can edit them, yes. However, it rather goes against the core mission of Wikibooks to host uneditable material.

== Deleted link to the Visual Studio OpenGL Tutorial ==

Hi, I think, that the Blog I've mentioned is a good opportunity to show to beginners, how to get GLUT and GLEW installed on your
Visual Studio programming environment. I know so many people that really NEED to know that, and are working with MS VS? The same time,
almost nobody uses Code Blocks...  so why delete the link to the blog? It makes sense to help people, does it not? And it took me 
many many hours, to get freeglut and glew installed and running on my computer with VS, so I thought I should prevent others from doing the same mistakes! 
So, please just leave it there for a few weeks, and if nobody is visiting the blog, I'll delete the link myself, I promisse :) ! How about that?

== General cleanup ==

Just noting, I've been looking through the AWB cleanup on [[Wikijunior:Languages]], and so far I've found a couple of them that were wrong &amp;mdash; where the thing being &quot;corrected&quot; was correct in context.  One was &amp;nbsp;'''p'''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;'''p'''ie&amp;nbsp; where the word-fragment &quot;ie&quot; was mistaken for a misrendering of &quot;i.e.&quot;, and the other where the phonetic representation &quot;nee&quot; was mistaken for a misrendering of &quot;née&quot;.  These both seem typical of the sorts of unusual representations that arise in linguistic discussions.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:53, 13 September 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The WBC hive is a double-skinned hive named after its inventor William Broughton Carr. Although it is presently used only by a minority of amateur beekeepers in the UK, it is the design that most people would immediately recognise as a wooden beehive, having a pitched roof, short legs, and multiple storeys with sloping sides, giving it a pagoda-like appearance.
The WBC was one of the first designs to use the British Standard brood frame, and as such the frames it uses exactly the same frames as the more common &quot;National&quot; hive.
A full WBC hive has the following components:
* A pitched roof, typically covered with metal. The roof gables usually feature a cone escape to allow stray bees to escape, and this is often mistaken for the main entrance in illustrations.
* Outer &quot;lifts&quot; with sloping sides. The lowest lift features a &quot;porch&quot; with &quot;slides&quot; which can be pushed across to block the entrance.
* Inner boxes which are broadly similar to the &quot;National&quot; hive, but slightly narrower and made of thinner boards to a simpler design
* A floor with short legs, usually splayed. The front back half of the floor is level, and the front half slopes downward and extends out beyond the lifts. The sloping floor creates a gap underneath the front edge of the brood box which forms the main entrance
== Advantages ==
* The design is attractive
* It is often argued that double-skinned hives like the WBC provide better insulation for the bees from hot and cold weather. However, this has not been proven by research
* When disassembling the hive, the lifts can be used as a stand for the supers, keeping heavy lifting to a minimum 
== Disadvantages ==
The WBC is often dismissed as a &quot;Victorian Monstrosity&quot;, for the some of the following reasons:
* WBC Hives have more parts than other designs and some of them are complex and hard to manufacture, making it expensive
* The hives are difficult to move, as the inner boxes are often not completely beetight and the entrance is hard to block.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Hebrews or Israelites==
[[File:Mosaic Tribes.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the 12 Tribes of Israel. From a synagogue wall in Jerusalem.]]

Hebrews (עברים) is an ethnonym used in the Jewish Bible. It is mostly taken as synonymous with the Semitic Israelites. The Israelites (בני ישראל) were a Semitic Hebrew-speaking people of the Ancient Near East, who inhabited part of the Land of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods (15th to 6th centuries BCE), later evolving into Jews and Samaritans of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, inhabiting the territories of Judea and Galilee, and Samaria respectively, though a Jewish diaspora had already developed outside of Judea and Galilee. In Modern Hebrew usage, an Israelite is, broadly speaking, a lay member of the Jewish ethno-religious community, as opposed to the priestly orders of Kohanim and Levites.

The word &quot;Israelite&quot; derives from the Biblical Hebrew word &quot;Israel&quot;. Although most literary references to Israelites are located in the Hebrew Bible, there is also abundant non-biblical archaeological and historical evidence of ancient Israel and Judah. The ethnonym is attested as early as the 13th century BCE in an Egyptian inscription. The Hebrew Bible etymologizes the name as from yisra &quot;to prevail over&quot; or &quot;to struggle/wrestle with&quot;, and el, &quot;God, the divine&quot;. The eponymous biblical patriarch of the Israelites is Jacob, who wrestled with God who gave him a blessing and renamed him &quot;Israel&quot; because he had &quot;striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.&quot; (''Genesis'' 32:24-32) According to the Hebrew Bible, Israelites were the &quot;chosen people&quot; of God. The name Hebrews is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;Israelites&quot;.

The biblical term &quot;Israelites&quot; (also the &quot;Twelve Tribes&quot; or &quot;Children of Israel&quot;) means both the direct descendants of the patriarch Jacob (Israel) as well as the historical populations of the united Kingdom of Israel. For the post-exilic period, beginning in the 5th century BCE, the remnants of the Israelite tribes came to be referred to as Jews (tribes of Judah, Simeon and partially Benjamin and Levi), named for the kingdom of Judah. This change is explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE). On the other hand, Samaritans (tribes of Menasseh, Ephraim and partially Benjamin and Levi) became named for Samaria. It replaced the title Children of Israel.

==History==

===Biblical Israelites===

The Torah traces the Israelites to the patriarch Jacob, grandson of Abraham, who was renamed Israel after a mysterious incident in which he wrestles all night with God (or an angel). Jacob's twelve sons (in order of birth), Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph and Benjamin, become the ancestors of twelve tribes, with the exception of Joseph, whose two sons Mannasseh and Ephraim become tribal eponyms.
[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|left|thumb|Map of the twelve tribes of Israel.]]

Jacob and his sons are forced by famine to go down into Egypt. When they arrive they and their families are 70 in number, but within four generations they have increased to 600,000 men of fighting age, and the Pharaoh of Egypt, alarmed, first enslaves them and then orders the death of all male Hebrew children. The God of Israel reveals his name to Moses, a Hebrew of the line of Levi; Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage and into the desert, where God gives them their laws and the Israelites agree to become his people. Nevertheless, the Israelites lack complete faith in God, and the generation which left Egypt is not permitted to enter the Promised Land.
[[File:C+B-Egypt-Fig15-KarnakPlaceListCartouches.PNG|thumb|Description of Israelite captives from the kingdoms of Israel and Judea, as they were portrayed on the Southern wall of Shoshenq I's Temple of Amun in Karnak (dated 925/6 BCE).]]

Following the death of the generation of Moses a new generation, led by Joshua, enters Canaan and takes possession of the land in accordance with the curse placed upon Canaan by Noah. Yet even now the Israelites lack strength in God in the face of the peoples of the land, and periods of weakness and backsliding alternate with periods of resilience under a succession of Judges. Eventually the Israelites ask for a king, and God gives them Saul. David, the youngest (divinely favored) son of Jesse of Bethlehem would succeed Saul. Under David the Israelites establish the kingdom of God, and under David's son Solomon they build the Temple where God takes his earthly dwelling among them. Yet Solomon sins by allowing his foreign wives to worship their own gods, and so on his death and reign of his son, Rehoboam, the kingdom is divided in two.

The kings of the northern kingdom of Israel are uniformly bad, permitting the worship of other gods and failing to enforce the worship of God alone, and so God eventually allows them to be conquered and dispersed among the peoples of the earth; in their place strangers settle the northern land. In Judah some kings are good and enforce the worship of God alone, but many are bad and permit other gods, even in the Temple itself, and at length God allows Judah to fall to her enemies, the people taken into captivity in Babylon, the land left empty and desolate, and the Temple itself destroyed.

Yet despite these events God does not forget his people, but sends Cyrus, king of Persia as his messiah to deliver them from bondage. The Israelites are allowed to return to Judah and Benjamin, the Temple is rebuilt, the priestly orders restored, and the service of sacrifice resumed. Through the offices of the sage Ezra, Israel is constituted as a holy community, bound by the Law and holding itself apart from all other peoples.

===Historical Israelites===
[[File:Merneptah Israel Stele Cairo.JPG|thumb|The Merneptah stele (JE 31408), bearing the first record of the name Israel (Cairo Museum).]]

In contrast to the Biblical account, it became clear by the 1920s that the idea of an Israelite conquest of Canaan - the story of the book of Joshua - was not supported by the archaeological record. The response of the time was to propose that the main biblical idea was still correct, but that the Israelites entered Canaan peacefully instead of through conquest. Later, this compromise was abandoned, and the Israelites were interpreted to be indigenous Canaanites. The revision of Israelite origins has implications for Israelite religion: whereas the Bible had depicted them as monotheists from the beginning, the new understanding is that they were polytheists who harboured a small and ultimately successful group of monotheistic revolutionaries.

The name Israel first appears c. 1209 BCE, at the end of the Late Bronze Age and the very beginning of the period archaeologists and historians call Iron Age I, in an inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah. The inscription is very brief and says simply: &quot;Israel is laid waste and his seed is not&quot;. The hieroglyph accompanying the name &quot;Israel&quot; indicates that it refers to a people, most probably located in the highlands of Samaria. Over the next two hundred years (the period of Iron Age I) the number of highland villages increased from 25 to over 300 and the settled population doubled to 40,000. There is general agreement that the majority of the population living in these villages was of Canaanite origin. By the 10th century BCE a rudimentary state had emerged in the north-central highlands, and in the 9th century this became a kingdom. The kingdom was sometimes called Israel by its neighbours, but more frequently it was known as the &quot;House (or Land) of Omri.&quot; Settlement in the southern highlands was minimal from the 12th through the 10th centuries BCE, but a state began to emerge there in the 9th century, and from 850 BCE onward a series of inscriptions are evidence of a kingdom which its neighbours refer to as the &quot;House of David.&quot;

===The rise of the Jews===

Jews (יְהוּדִים‎), also known as the Jewish people, are an ethno-religious group originating from the Israelites or Hebrews. According to the ''Books of Chronicles,'' chapter 9 line 2, the Israelites, who took part in The Return to Zion were from the Tribe of Judah alongside the tribes of Simeon, Benjamin, Levi, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were absorbed into it. 

After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539, Judah became a province of the Persian empire. This status continued into the following Hellenistic period, when Yehud became a disputed province of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria. In the early part of the 2nd century BCE, a revolt against the Seleucids led to the establishment of an independent Jewish kingdom under the Hasmonean dynasty. The Hasmoneans adopted a deliberate policy of imitating and reconstituting the Davidic kingdom, and as part of this forcibly converted to Judaism their neighbours in the Land of Israel. The conversions included Nabateans (Zabadeans) and Itureans, the peoples of the former Philistine cities, the Moabites, Ammonites and Edomites. Attempts were also made to incorpoarate the Samaritans, following takeover of Samaria. The success of mass-conversions is however questionable, as most groups retained their tribal separations and mostly turned Hellenistic or Christian, with Edomites perhaps being the only exception to merge into the Jewish society under Herodian dynasty and in the following period of Jewish-Roman Wars. While there are some references to maintaining the tribal separation among Israelites during the Hasmonean period, the dominant position of the tribe of Judah as well as nationalistic policies of Hasmoneans to refer to residents of Hasmonean Judea as Jews practically erased the tribal distinction, with the exception of the priestly orders of Levites and Kohanim (tribe of Levi).

The Babylonian Jewish community, though maintaining permanent ties with the Hasmonean and later Herodian kingdoms, evolved into a separate Jewish community, which during the Talmudic period assembled its own practices-the Babylonian Talmud, slightly differing from the Jerusalem Talmud. The Babylonian Jewry is considered to be the predecessor of most Mizrachi Jewish communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Watergate Salad came about in history at about the same time as the Watergate scandal.  At the time, my mother heard this recipe on a local radio program, and on that program (The Good Neighbor Show), they explained how the name came about.  It was pretty simple.  The basic premise was that government is filled with nuts and fruit, and with those involved in the Watergate scandal being the symbol of governmental craziness at its best, the name of this salad full of fruit and nuts was an oblique reference to the political atmosphere as perceived by the populace at that time in history.----</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Information systems in the consumer industry: a customer approach

Franco Miotto

'''''''''Introduction'''

This work is addressed to everyone who asks himself what will be, in the near future, the information needs for the consumer industry. This paper is thus addressed to people working in information technology, marketing, organization or general management. Their interest will be over the whole book and, particularly, in the chapters regarding the general objective and solutions architecture for the industry and retail environment.

This works derives from various personal experiences out of which I chose the two real cases which are presented in the initial chapters: in both cases the real problem was to shift the company information focus from the support of internal processes to the analysis and evaluation of the market scenario in which the companies were acting.

One of the problems I had to cope while doing this job is to be sure to use a methodology which would help me taking into consideration every part of the problem, not forgetting any aspect. 

The method is one of the aims of the book.

From a presentation point of view, I decided to start from the real cases and then get to the abstraction, not vice versa; it seems to me easier to understand. This is the reason why the case studies are quoted initially; they should help the reader to face the more “formal” discussions with an operational attitude, not as just “principia”.

Generally I think that, after the pure automation phase (accounting, MRP etc.), information technology will need to help industries to approach the complete cycle of customer needs. This will mean taking into consideration processes with a very little syntactic content but very common: informational unstructured scenarios. I think that these processes are the one that will give us some better prediction information models and also improve our operational and control tools.

I am sure that his work has plenty of ingenuities, methodological and language mistakes but, as I found no literature on these topics, I decided to use it as a request for help so that we can make a better service to our general “customer”.

'''''A case study of reengineering of information systems – industry.''

'''The company''': this case history is about a middle sized industry in the market of apparel and fashion.

The total business is fairly split between production of fabric and underwear, especially beach wear.

The company was historically a weaving site and the apparel part was created to fill the period of the year when fabric production was low. 

The company was created by a single person, a fairly typical situation, and grew up on such a one-person organizational schema. As time passed and markets changed, this model showed its limits and the whole company was suffering poor sales. Everybody was feeling that something new was needed but there was no clear model to follow or copy. The company was slowly losing all its assets: market as well as culture, including human expertise in management, control and operations.

The market: as you might have guessed the main part of the customers belong to two different categories:

# Other companies buying fabric
# Retailers buying underwear and beachwear.

We are thus talking about two different classes of customers with two different sales channels (direct sales vs. sales agents) and different habits. Geographically the company was selling mainly in Italy with little or no foreign turnaround.

From the “marketing” point of view the two parts had a completely different approach:

# The “fabric” department had very little “brand awareness” as the product was thought for a technical market  where the customers are specialists
# The “underwear” department had a definite need for “brand recognition” as this is a large part of the final sale.

The existing information system: as it often happens the actual IT was the result of many years overlapping without the possibility of a real radical rethinking. This was due to two major reasons:

Any radical reorganization of the IT system would have meant discussing the real essence of the company both in scopes and in structure

The IT manager did not have the organizational strength and will to pursue such a task, a job which would have meant criticizing actual high class managers.

The whole situation was also worsened by the fact that the new line of business (“the underwear”) started as a result of another company acquisition. 

All of these factors lead to the existence of two different systems, almost non compatible and with double costs in terms of maintenance and development; worse of all the existence of two technical worlds created the idea that two different companies were acting and that no synergies were possible.

Control system was also a problem as the two systems used different coding and taxonomy so a third system had to exist to aggregate the final data.

Economical perspectives: the international market context and production methods were driving the company to a slow decline in spite of local situation like crisis of recoveries. The whole business model had to be redesigned and the IT was a problem for this. 

First of all the company needed to understand what was important and what was not; this information  was not in the IT capabilities as the system was the image of the company situation and it could not merge internal information with external signals also because people working in it was too busy in getting it going on the operational side.

'''The turn point''' of the situation came when a new CEO was appointed. He decided to analyze every process to create a more elastic and homogeneous company structure. This decision put the top manager in a very delicate position: he could have been the successful innovator, the visionary leader or the excuse for a failure. Particularly in one-man company (level 2 of the Greiner model) product and direct processes are so deeply tangled that any structure variation is seen as an “offense” to the history of the enterprise and these changes are not considered as rational necessities for the company health. Service processes, and IT especially, are not felt as “communication needs” as this job was done by the founder as a physical person. Obviously we all know that is one of the deepest reasons why that communication model (the one-man company) cannot raise over a certain dimension and therefore cannot gain certain dimensional efficiencies.  

With the help of an advisor the new CEO has looked into the problem of updating the IT system and his first problem was to decide which kind of approach was to use:

'''The content approach''': this is the most common approach and it start from defining the typical parameters connected to:

* Technology situation: both technical and functional (HW, SW, user requests coverage etc.)
* Consultancy situation: both related to the existence of “best practices” in the field and to the presence of players (consultancy firms) available
* Project content: typically you tend to copy the actual requirement schema because it is what users ask for
* Timing: months to years horizons
* Objective: to a have a more flexible and usable platform; an updated environment.

'''The functional approach''': this approach starts from a different point of view: “we want to improve customer service” where “the customer” is both the internal user but mainly the external sales customer as this last one certifies the company in the market. So, for each process, we it was necessary to define:

* The customer: who is he? (both known and potential)
* The service: what does this mean? product, attention, social needs
* The product: what the expectations of the customer (the standard we want) as a function of reliability, availability, fashion alignment.
* Esteem needs: achievement, attention, recognition
* Social needs: belonging, recognized interaction
* How do we define and how do we measure these needs?
* How do we acquire these informations?

The main purpose of this approach is to define some quantitative parameters for a business model with particular attention to the idea of “customer service”.

This second approach was really appreciated also for its “push” attitude on people who had somehow lost what the market really asked for, even though this analysis requires, as an assumption, that a customer knows what he wants, a “mature” approach, and this, by itself, is a statement to be demonstrated.

The first real step was then to figure out what the customer real needs were, differentiating them from what were historically thought them to be or from what were perceived by the various intermediate acting agents. The basic idea was to compare which information were in the IT system and which one were needed to be really customer compliant as to decide which way to invest in the general company information system.

On the external customers, the real steps which followed began with

* Identify “representative customer” by the sale force
* Check whether these customers were really representative of the whole internal market by defining the selection criteria for a sample
* Make an interview to “random customer”, “statistically sample customer” and “representative customers”
* Collect their needs and cross table the results.

The beginning was a disaster, the general attitude was:

Sales people: customers are an asset of “my” division; it is only me who should talk to them

Marketing people: the product is “right”; it is the customer who does not understand it (!).

The CEO skill was to be able to maintain the right direction and get everybody to understand that the company could only grow if it would face the real changing world, avoiding closures and blind behaviors; a formal check is something which is in the nature of improving processes.

As a result of this phase it turned out that the important parameter to be fixed was “time-to-market”: both the fabric and the underwear department could not compete with far-east productions in terms of prices so, assuming that quality was perceived as “sufficient” (therefore a correct positioning on the market) the request was for small production quantities which were to be available quickly.

From the company point of view, this meant:

# A better information system connection
# A better relation system between customer and vendor
# A product industrial design which could allow a quicker response
# A different industrial relation management for customer who need products with a long lead time
# A better forecasting and projection system.

This whole analysis was then enlarged to non-covered channels like e-commerce and direct retail.

'''The solution approach: obliterate or improve'''. This question has been raised so many times by the times of Hammer and Davenport and we know that it has no general answer but it must be correctly posted in the real context. This pragmatic approach must also keep into consideration that the smaller the company the more important is the role of individual physical persons which are themselves “organizational customers” with their background of Maslow needs.

Inside the company the process started requesting each key employee how he felt about the idea of “customer” whether internal or external. We then reversed the question and asked everyone how he felt as being a “customer”, which kind of expectations he had, whether fulfilled or not. In this way we arrived to define a map of “needs”. We then matched these “needs” with their coverage both declared (by the function) and perceived (by the customer).

The difficulties we found, at this stage, were essentially two:

* The capacity of “customer”  and “supplier” to estimate the importance and the coverage of problems; aggressive users tent to impose small problems as important mainly to show that were important people while passive persons would adapt to uneasy situations for the sake of peace
* The difficulty in accepting the idea that, being the company a whole system, the total result is the combination of all parts running well and not just a sum of parts each running at its own speed.

The fact that external consultants were involved helped people to question themselves as well as gave the company an external evaluation of specific professional capability.

In this analysis period the IT group showed its greatest limits as it was trying to support individual needs without having the chance of harmonizing the whole system. Individual requests were pushing into specific directions so the general feeling was that of a waste of time and money. From the outside we can say that it was just a representation of the company situation but to the inside this was the excuse for the falling efficiency.

'''The final choice''': as we said the CEO found himself in the middle of 

* The outside world and the its dynamics
* The needs of the internal operators and especially of the owner.

The way he chose included:

* Making the situation clear to everybody including the owner
* Understanding the stakeholder needs and make them the strategic goals
* Formally analyze the market needs
* Define the organizational model including the operational role and responsibility of the stakeholder
* Getting all the human resources through a processes of upgrading their attitude to “customer service”
* Define the instruments to control both the “service” and economic indicators of each department.

As far as the IT department the choice was:

# Simplify the existing reporting processes as much as possible so that the actual technical infrastructure would last some time allowing the company to concentrate on other projects
# Invest very much on instruments related to “company critical” issues like
* Style research
* Product design and management
* Technical product definition
* Market analysis
* CRM
# Define a strategy to clear out the dependence of the company from a few IT people who actually could not be changed and get the user to accept some minor cut in service level as a function of a clearer general view on the whole system. This part was to support the company up to the change of the system in a medium time period (2–3 years), mainly through a process of data and process definition.

''A case study of reengineering of information systems – retail.''

The company:  this case study is about a small-medium sized apparel company retail division. This company, as it often happens, started on the idea of a specific line of products and later approached the retail channel in a naive way.  The retail story began with the need of liquidating the company surplus in a company outlet; this was not enough so the company approached the outlets circuit. At this point it did happen that the product offer was not balanced to make a good service to the customer so the company had the need to work with the stock channel to get rid of what was left over.

By that time the company thought it has developed a culture of “retail” so it made a decision to approach the wholesale market with mono-brand locations and/or shop-in-shop experience in the department stores.

Almost always such a change implies a large item offer so the initial “product” idea spread over a “total look” vision with its corresponding design and production problems.

The company we are talking about moved from an offer of about 150 samples to about 500 pieces thus multiplying by three the whole paperwork.

The retail division had a target of about 50 sales point, searched by a consultant and interiorly designed by a fashion architect.

The market: the company operated in the casual sportswear mainly on jackets. Geographical distribution was worldwide but mainly rich eastern countries and emerging countries, due to the average price of the product. The “ideal” customer belonged to a fairly rich class, he liked sportswear and he was fairly aggressive. The style actually intended to be aggressive enough to be chosen both by young and older people.

The existing retail IT system was originally chosen to support the initial outlet, so its main features were:

* Low cost
* Little and clear functionalities
* One level architecture (shops and main)
* single cash register in a shop
* Written and maintained by a near located, “friend” software house.

Quite a few problems had been solved on a “quick” solution attitude as volumes were small, no general approach.

The whole situation was worsened by the fact that no user came from a structured culture environment so they tent to solve their problems on an unstructured, personal way.

When the whole phenomena grew bigger two very dangerous behaviors came up:

# The stockholder thought: “if it works for four it will work for five etc.”
# The software house used to say: “I am willing to grow up with you: tell me what you want and I will do it.”

The company was really pushing the instrument over its project limits patching it over and over.

The economical situation: mainly due to the international crisis the company was financially overexposed and the shop system was a real weight to the balance sheet: out of a dozen shops existing only two or three were profitable, another two or three run even and the rest were both losing money and creating end-of-season unsold inventory. These numbers also did not take into account hidden costs that the company had to sustain to help the shop system; costs which are difficult to pin out but that are often consistent.  I am talking about time spent by “structure” people like accounting and/or logistics to help the whole system run.

The turn point came when an outside consultancy firm had to investigate the economical situation on behalf of a new possible stakeholder. The problem was not so much the retail policy as a principle but the way it had been implemented. The company culture was industrial and everybody used to think to “customers” as being wholesaler, which means professionals, and not final customers.

Even if a retail manager and a merchandiser existed, real decisions were made by people coming from “product” oriented people so many the whole process was still very “fashion” and “industry”.

'''The functional approach''': to evaluate correctly the job to be done we went through a dimensional analysis of the needs of the retail department customers including all the aspects of “product”; “subjective” and “social” aspects.

For every view we tried to find as many “objective” data as possible trying to avoid preconceptions. This job was guided by an external consultant, a right choice in my opinion, as we thought that no internal resource could be enough professionally detached to guarantee a correct evaluation.

First thing the company did was to separate needs: wholesale and final customers. This meant almost doubling the job but it allowed checking whether the requests of the retail channel (both wholesaler and property shop) matched with the “real” final customer wishes.

Physically the job has been done through check lists compiled by hired personnel both in the case of retailer and of final customers. Actually final customers were divided into two major categories: customers contacted in shops (already aware of the brand) and people looking at apparel shop windows (apparel keen but not especially on the brand).

Every interview was then graded according to the expectation of satisfaction both as need and as answer to it. The complete results and the exact form of the questions are not public, what we can derive are the changes the company did in its customer policies.

Question sheet results: as far as final customers are concerned we found that:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “fashion” but “middle low class” and definitely not “high class” as the company thought it was. Competitors were quite different from what the company dreamed they were. Some product categories were “identified” while other were considered “useless”
* Product - reliability: quality was recognized but the price was considered too high
* Product – availability: very low, even if much paper presentation was made on the product, the real possibility to find the item in the shops was low. Part of the problem related also to the fact that the company had decided not to offer on the web a certain number of “flagship” items
* Subjective – recognition: sales people “customer service ” attitude was judged barely sufficient
* Subjective – attention: sales people technical support counseling was perceived as not sufficient and this contributed heavily to the perception of a middle low class brand
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual sales people but, on the average, not very high; the brand was definitely not felt like “friendly”
* Social – belongness: a strong feeling of group belonging was felt
* Social - distinction: fulfillment of this need is low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

For retailer the results were:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “average”; the rating was better than the one given by final customers
* Product - reliability: good, little commercial returns and very few items with quality problems
* Product – availability: medium/ low due to poor respect of delivery dates
* Subjective – recognition: quite good, the “retail” customer service was considered very effective
* Subjective – attention: low, customer perceived some sort of company haughtiness
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual agents but, on the average, sufficient
* Social – belongness: no  group feeling existed for retailers
* Social - distinction:  low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

'''Company actions''': based on the results we just quoted, the company decided to

* Product offering returned to about 150-200 pieces for wholesaler and a further set of about 100 pieces distributed only in company stores. These last set of garments were essentially variations on existing garments, to simplify the design phase.  The whole set could then cover the “total-look” scenario for the shops and satisfy brand-keen customers.
* Advertising:  this moved into two directions. The first one tried to re-position the brand in a “high class” section via the relations with testimonials and events. The second activity (fashion and newspapers) was addressed only to the countries where a distribution network existed and not everywhere; only one new foreign market was to be pursued each year.
* Company shops: only economical justified shops stayed open, with the new product offering. As far as new openings were concerned the strategy was to create mixed companies with local operators. These new middle-sized shops were addressed mainly on the sales of the well known products (jackets) and there was a one year starting period to reach balance break even, and no more.
* External wholesalers: the company recognized their importance and created a contact and support groups with the idea of improve their brand loyalty.
* Agents: the company cleared that a new attitude was needed: they were to become not only customer-order collector but also product and “prospect customers” proposers. Quite a few agents did not accept and interrupted their business relation with the company; the major criticism was that there was no longer an independent agent role but that we were talking of company show rooms and methods. This was one of the most difficult parts of the whole project.
* Company shops sale personnel: a long process of selection and education is still taking place to reach the correct standard in human relations and technical knowledge.
* Shop customer service: it became the real guideline of the retail division. Every aspect has been re-analyzed: from shop lay-out to packaging to personnel clothing and attitude. Mock customers are evaluating each site randomly and their results are discussed monthly at company level and twice-a-year with shop managers.
* Main IT system: the upgrade on this was very limited and it concerned almost only the quality of basic data regarding customer needs like delivery dates or quality indexes
* Retail IT system: this system has been changed very heavily. The operational part has been upgraded to a new instrument and also, even more important, new CRM systems have been introduced regarding both classical topics, like fidelity cards, and new topics like known and unknown person recognition. The possibility to follow the path inside the shop and on the front windows gave the opportunity to improve internal paths and increment the time passers-by would stop in front of the shop.

Generally speaking the reengineering is still going on but the results, up to now, are very encouraging  in terms of customer service and of sales point balance break even where all the company shops are now correctly placed.

''Introduction to methodology''

Starting from the two real case studies we saw, now we want to analyze, at the highest level, the information needs for the processes of a consumer company. This will help us in defining the whole context of data and procedures to be informationally represented. Once we have done this step we can then match the existing coverage with the actual IT system.

In this work I will specifically speak about clothing industry but the method is valid also for other companies and specially for those where “customer care” is a goal and not only an instrument.

It might happen that the customer is not conscious of his needs but then, I think, we should pursue a “maieutic” process of extraction more than the induction of a new need. In this vision of business, agents and retailers are part of the “extended” enterprise as they transmit the idea of “service”.

The reason why I chose the apparel world is that, among companies which operate on physical goods, most probably is the one which best fits the “service” idea in terms of

* Volume of goods and informations
* Changing ratio for the product
* Low unitary value for the product
* Different ways of approaching the final customers
* Difference between “customer” (retailer) and “consumer” (2 decision levels).

Anyway I tried to be as general as possible and you could think of applying this method even to politics as a “service” industry to people.

 Before getting into the phase of analysis, I would like to consider something we quickly quoted: apparel sales are usually made in shop with the help of an employee. From the point of view of producers the “customer” is the retailer or some people in its organization (e.g. department store) while the “real” market is the end-user.  The employee actually has a very important role in addressing the choice but he is also a fundamental vehicle for the satisfaction of the esteem needs of the “real customer”.

From an information point of view, the employee is a problem as it creates a “human” bias on the sales data (he addresses the sale) and also, sometimes, he forces his opinions into the information system. The same problem exists in the process of selling the garments to the retailers: the agent can be himself a source of information errors.   

 

As my goal is to help defining a model for an information system, to be later translated into technical instruments, I need to define data, states and processes into detail. This is a huge work and I decided to stop at first level; this is not an ERP detail analysis which would be unrealistic. Sometime I go deeper in the analysis when I think that the actual topic has not been fully cleared.

'''Analysis Methodology'''

As analysis practice is not so clear and defined, I tried to use a methodological approach as general as possible using technique of system and process analysis.

Let us define “system” as an ordered set of organized elements all of them aimed at a certain goal. These elements can include physical objects (hardware, software), people, informations, instruments etc.

The representation of a physical system can be made via a dynamic picture (processes) or a static picture (states). A process can be defined as the passage between states (initial and final) of a system; the “state” is the photograph of a system in a steady situation. 

According to the nature of the content, we can divide processes in information-bound (e.g. document handling) and physical object related (service) ones. In the first group the information and physical process coincide. As far as the second case is concerned let us make an example related to the industrial world: we can define the state (space and time location of goods: logistic view) or the changing process (goods transformation: industrial view).

The associated information system, related to the physical one, must define the context, the initial state and the transformation rules (processes).

Here we are interested in defining the abstract model (information model in our case) of the real system (natural of artificial) which we call physical system. The representation has its meaning in the context defined by variables and metrics which relate the variables to physical data. Context is defined by the choice of variables and their physical significance; state by the initial values (inventory etc.) and process by the measurement quantities (inventory movements etc.).

Informations (context meaningful data) are itself object of some form of treatment: we classify information “functions” into retrieval, storage, transmission, transformation and presentation.

Just for the sake of completeness we quote the conceptual problem of “measure” problem in its two faced aspects of the need of a measuring instrument and of the fact that the measuring action could change the measured system.

We need also to remind that we have been talking about “semantic ontologies” (which means that these rules belong to a general schema including variables and metric systems) while we know that in the global information world there are plenty of unstructured semantics with many informations inside but with a high grade of difficulty in using them.

In this work, we are interested in “business processes” which are artificial processes representing functions related to the activity of a business company. These processes, not like natural systems, do not work on deterministic laws where, once you know the initial state and the total input, the total output of the system is pre-determined. We are talking about social systems in different cultural environments and related to unpredictable events so the output, at most, can only be generally forecasted and not galileianly determined. 

In this chapter more than trying to represent the processes in formally correct a usable language (a task for methodologies like UML), I would like to approach the problem of a methodology to be sure that every aspect of an information problem has been taken into consideration; I am looking how to define all the aspects of an industrial general process, a fashion one in our case.

We already saw that to define the information system we need to individuate the values of the variables related both to the state and to the process; in my experience this passes through the analysis of what I call the “information dimensions” where a dimension is an independent set of information data.

From a practical point of view we have to ask ourselves a set of questions about the initial state and about what happens in the system. The questions I asked myself are:

* What: what is the content of the process; which indicators are chosen and measured in the process
* How: how do I collect and treat informations (state), how does the process happen. This dimension includes the problem of the measuring methods, of the change of indicators (e.g. six-sigma method) and of the choice of the representation language for a coherent formalism
* Who: the definition of the actors in the process and their representation in terms of informations
* Where: which are the location of the processes; initial, actual and results places? In a global system these places can be very far away so you have to consider time-shift, different languages (presentation) and culture
* When: the time the process starts (initial state), lives and finishes so that parameters are in the final state (remember that people are components of the system)
* How much: what is the change in the variables; both internal and context variables
* Why: the reason why the process happens: internal laws (initial stability of the system) and external (context need).

Out of all these questions the most peculiar one is certainly “Why” as sometimes it is related to external laws or habits and sometimes it relates to internal reasons of order and efficiency. Again these last considerations show that we are not operating in a “classical” deterministic world.

 The “how much” dimension relates the process to the physical reality (remember we are trying to write some sort of “semantics” of physical processes). We should be able to separate really meaningful variables which actually change during the process assuming that, quite often, the change is only a statistical change and the sample is in the limit of the De Moivre (see example) theorem.

It might happen that some dimension coincides: for example imagine the physical process of an apple falling form a tree. In this case the “what” and the “where” of the process are the same as the process is exactly the fall of the apple; this does not mean that we can confuse

“where” as a geographical context and

“where” as a content of the process.

From the point of view of methodology all the dimensions should be taken into consideration and, in special case, some of them coincide.

As we said, we are talking about systems which are not completely deterministic, like classical physics; space-time homogeneity is to be considered a lucky case and not a general situation. This implies that reversibility of processes is not guaranteed, sometime it is even forbidden; so certain technical instruments (compensation handlers) cannot be given for granted.

''' The company goal: a real problem.'''

We assume that a fashion company goal is to create value via improving the level of the apparel worn in the surrounding world which, by itself, is the target market for the company itself. This gets real through four fundamental processes:

* '''Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs'''
* '''Ability to rationalize and interpreter customer needs'''
* '''Ability to satisfy customer needs'''
* '''Ability to explain its capability in satisfying the needs.'''

The way to solve this major task is the full stream of the industrial project with all its aspects: marketing, sales, production, logistics, and structure.

In the marketing books we can see underlined the meaning of the 4P (product, price, place, promotion) which means getting the right product, at the right price, in the right place at the right moment  and tell this opportunity to the customer.

 From an information point of view, this analysis leaves us with more than one open question, the most important: what does “right” means? How can we measure such a quantity? Someone says that it will be the market response to determine whether or not the choice was “right” but this is an answer  “a posteriori”; what a company needs is a correct, or at least “best guess”, forecast “a priori”.

Customer needs: fundamentals

 Before advancing further I think we should clear out what “customer needs” are.

Psychologist  Abraham Maslow indicated a hierarchy of needs into 5 levels:

Physiological needs (air, water, nourishment, sleep)

Safety (medical insurance, job security, peace)

Social needs (friends, group belonging, give and receive love)

Esteem (self-respect, achievement, recognition, reputation)

Self-actualization (truth, justice, wisdom, meaning)

Once a need is mostly satisfied it no longer motivates and the next higher need takes place.

As far as clothing are concerned 

* The first level is never taken into account
* The second level concerns “utilitarianism” which means the basic role of garments as defense from environment (cold etc.). In the rich society this needs is getting less and less important because of many factors (the heating systems, cars) which modify the relation between human body and environment. This need is still very important into technical clothing (work, sport) where functionality is predominant
* In the third level I would introduce personal feeling (cashmere hand feeling, valentino’s red, leather smell) and the sensation we feel when we fit well
* In the fourth level I think we can fit the social factor of recognition in the act of buying the garment (actual sale moment) or in the belonging to a “group” with its distinctive signs. Some authors tent to underline the first aspect but the actual rise in the internet sales seems to contradict them. Another argument supporting the after-sale group belonging experience is related to the expanding business of counterfeiting which could indicate how much people need to be “brand dependent”
* The fifth point, in my opinion, includes a real shopping experience in which the customer is recognized as an individual and his needs are fulfilled in a mature and respectful way.

Personally I think that the rating of the various needs depend not only on the person himself but also on the context (time, place and mood) which, by itself is not a scientific variable.

  

Customer needs: practice

What we really want to do is zeroing the difference between customer expectations and the perception of the product/service quality of what he has bought; in this case we have satisfied our customer who thinks he has paid the correct price for what he buys.

Referring  to the quality service models via multidimensional hierarchical analysis (Dabholkar) or to gap analysis model (Parasumaran et alt.) and integrating other variables, we must satisfy quality parameters related to:

* Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)
* Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)
* Product: availability where and when it is requested
* Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)
* Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)
* Subjectivity : empathy
* Sociality: group belonging
* Sociality: individual recognition.

As we said before, customer satisfaction is a multi-faced operation and we must never forget that the “customer” is “the important person” and not only a “product” accessory, even for the best products. On the other hand, we do not want to “sell dreams” with no product around as, once the sale euphoria passed, we would have an unsatisfied customer and no customer retention in future time.

As far as the “social” part of the company-customer business relation we keep into consideration the difference between “style” and “fashion” (Espinoza  - MIT Media Lab). “Style” is a principal component in group identity so, maybe in a costly way, it can be copied from someone outside the “group”. To keep it difficult for externals to keep updated with the group dynamics, the code must be continuously changed and this give rise to the “fashion” phenomena. Now we understand how “fashion” is something related to the internal of a group while “style” relates to an outside value for the group culture. When a new “style” reaches a critical mass it gets accepted into social culture and some new break point are looked for.

This topic becomes very important when we talk about information systems (in the wide sense) for the social aspect.

Data importance

From a survey we did in a group of generic customers, we found that the relative importance of the various factors in the buying action is

Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)    6,3

Product: availability where and when it is requested    9,0

Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)    7,0

Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)    7,3

Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)    7,3

Subjectivity : empathy    6,6

Sociality: group belonging    5,9

Sociality: individual recognition.    6,3

It is important to point out that these values are related to a sample of customers in the field of apparel so its value is significant only in this field.

Methodologies for a solution

Actual methods for solving the customer needs are now essentially two:

# Industry: start from customer  requirements and designing the whole industrial process (design, production, logistic) to fulfill the need
# Trade: choosing globally and offering locally what the retailer thinks is the best solution for the customer need.

These approaches, obviously, have some common aspects but also some special features that we shall discuss later.   

''General processes''

Let us now analyze the processes which exist in both methodologies.

Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs

In this process, the system is the environment “company – potential customer” where the customer is the owner, more or less conscious, of his needs. The goal of the process is to share this information with the company.

'''Why''' should we try to perceive the need? The answer lies in an agnostic approach on other people needs. In my opinion a company role is not to believe to be the truth depositary but to be the instrument for maybe extracting and solving customers requests.

'''Who''' acts in the process of need perception? Three kind of people act: who has the need (the customer), who collects the need, who transmits the need.   

Feeling the need, the customer is the person who explicitly raises the request (demand driven) or who owns the hidden need who is to be extracted (supply driven).

We can categorize our customers into:

* Well known customers, person we know via a history of relations (fidelity cards or so); among these customers we care particularly about customers who have shown to be statistically significant in terms of representation of the whole customer set
* Unknown or random customers
* Potential customers: among these we could include people belonging to social groups which we consider target for our product, people looking at shop windows or people coming and not buying anything (prospects).

It is obvious that there are different marketing strategies on the three groups: in the first case we want to keep our customer and increase cross-selling or up-selling. In the second situation we want to make our customers loyal, in the third case we want to reduce entry barriers.

Collecting customer needs: I think we can individuate three kinds of people, the first one is someone whose job is to “feel” the market in its wider sense (society, various environments), sometime they are called “cool hunters” or scouts. The second group is formed by the agents who work together with retailers: their view is wider than the single retailer but is narrower and more precise than the one of the scout. The last group is made by sale executives who are actually in contact with specific customers so they have a clear, definite view of a limited request.

Transmitting the information: it would be easy to say that these people are the same that collects it, but it is not true in my experience. This function is often felt as a secondary job so it is delegated to another person, an assistant, done in the spare time or even worse hidden as felt part of the person assets. This attitude implies a great loss of quality in the information transmitted to the company.

'''What''' is a need, what does a customer looks for. Let us start by classifying this dimension on three values:

* Defined needs: specific requests of a definite object  (raincoat, wind jacket) maybe connected in a new environment (e.g. long gloves for snowboarders)
* Semi-structured requests: more general than the former one, yet not very precise. One possible example could be “something like that jacket but the fur around the hood” or “slightly longer or shorter”. This kind of requests, mainly regarding the product, are often expressed in a sign, non-verbal language so they are very difficult to collect and transmit
* Geographical or context needs: particular colors related to a culture or a “glamour” trend better than an understatement. These are examples of customer needs difficult to receive and use but very rich in informations.

In this dimension we have actually analyzed only product needs, we can use the same detail level also for the other levels of needs (internal esteem, social and self-actualization needs). As far as I know there is no research going on this topic which seems very interesting and largely unknown.

'''Where''': about the place the need occurs. There is definitely a relation between the “where” and the class of needs (defined, semi-structured or context); we can recognize:

* Shops: these are the places where there is an explicit interaction with the customer regarding well structured needs. This is a very important information asset
* Shop windows or shop routings: we are talking about potential customers who do not interact explicitly, this is an important patrimony of informations fairly unstructured and difficult to catch and categorize
* Competitors: we are looking at customer needs through what the competitors are offering; it is like looking at the solution and trying to guess the problem. This becomes important when competitors have access at context we cannot get into, for example far away markets
* General geographical distribution: the most general and also the most difficult situation to analyze; as an example you can think about the fact that there is no accepted taxonomy in the fashion business.

As far as the definition of the collection and storage of data, the problem is now shifting form technology problems to the definition of an accepted semantic of data.

'''How'''. To understand how we can perceive customer needs let us consider how these needs show out. We can think of three kinds of externalization:

* Conscious personal needs like an explicit request to a sale operator
* Unconscious personal needs like taking a garment in my hand, looking at it and putting it back
* Social needs like a new “fashion”.

How do we perceive these needs: for each kind we must think of a way to define the elementary information (the state) so we need

* Instruments for sales support, both real and missed
* Instruments for context analysis
* Instruments for competitors analysis
* Instrument for social trend analysis.

Specially talking about the first process, we must be very careful about the easiness of use and the precision of the instrument as the actual operator sometime works in a “normal” situation and sometime in a changed environment like “sales” or “rush times”. Another topic to be considered is related to the significance of the data we are collecting:

* Does an observed customer behave like an ignorant one?
* The data I am getting are biased by the collection process?

At the moment I think these can be considered smaller problems compared to the fact that now we have no data.

 Last but not least there might be a problem on context bias: if we collect data in a luxury shop we shall have a “luxury” view of the problem, same thing for a low income customer environment. This obviously becomes a problem in inter-class analysis while it is not so bad if the company target is parallel to the sample set.

'''When''' do we collect informations and do we use them?

Using the data schema we just defined, we can say that

* Geographical or context needs have a longer time horizon than the specific product; could be one or two years
*  Semi-structured requests are looking mainly a few months in advance, from one season to another; they seems a slightly shorter “time to market” of what is accepted today
* Defined needs are typically immediate in their nature; the ideal would be to answer as soon as the need arise.

Data collection time is definitely related to the nature and horizon of the need but we can post it, more or less, in the sale period and consider a large period dependence on the level of the signal.

 Usage is again related to the class of need and has a strong period dependence the shorter the horizon is.

'''How many signals''' should I collect and how significant must they be?

This is a three sided problem: a problem of method, a problem of measured content and a problem of reference value.

Let us face the method problem: if a customer exclaims “beautiful” in front of a garment the statistical variance of the variable “beauty” is equal to the value of the variable itself so the information is not very reliable. De Moivre’s theorem tells us that the variance of the sample is related to the variance of the population sample as the reciprocal of the square root of the dimension of the sample. Four people saying “beautiful” are twice more reliable than one customer and begin to be statistically significant.

As far as the content of the variables we want to measure, they have to allow you to create a predictive model so they must be objective oriented. Let us make an example: sales turnaround during full price periods and during sales. If we make this analysis in mono-brand shops this becomes an indicator of price correctness between different categories as the offer stays the same and only the price changes so if the trousers percentage sales increases it means that people thought that trousers were too expensive. If the same statistics was run in a multi-brand wholesaler this could be an indicator of “among-brand” competition.

This last example introduce us to the third problem: the value of a measured variable has to be properly fit in its context. A large fur company made a large error some time ago when its sales rose quite lot in one period. This was due mainly to a large competitor’s problem but the signal was interpreted as a growing trend. The fact was that the company did not take into account the fact that the whole fur-coat market was in a steady/declining situation so the raise was to be explained as temporary phenomena.

This dimension can thus be summarized as the capacity of collecting “good” data on significant variables and fit them in the right context.

'''Methods and instruments''': the collection of data is a very difficult process from an operational point of view. 

* Defined needs, as we said these needs exist only for known customers in well defined places. Almost all sales point have instruments for operational processes (inventory movement, invoices, cash accounting), some of these products also have limited CRM functions mainly for after sale care (fidelity cards, recalls). A few of them also have options for supporting sales planning both a budget point of view and from a space/path analysis. As far as I know there is no common solution for requests and lost sales analysis.
* Semi-structured requests related to occasional or unknown customers. In my opinion this is an uncovered field as no specific instrument is available. I read about one experience of customers wearing RFID bracelets to follow their path inside the sale room but it seems to be abandoned (I would not have liked it). Video analysis for figure recognition, apart from privacy problems, is not yet fully available.
* Geographical or context needs: This is a huge and extremely interesting information problem.  It relates to the capacity of analyzing socially open spaces to get signals of “trends” which might appear. As far as I know there is nothing like this existing at the moment. An interesting approach would take into consideration TV and movie pictures: they are biased by the choice of the costumes director but they can be analyzed more and more, till when the algorithm gives acceptable result.

'''

'''Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs

In this case the context system to be considered is the company and the process goal is to share the data perceived by the marketing department with the design, industrialization, production and logistic departments (industry) or purchase department (retail)  which are the ones who have to propose a company realistic solution.

'''Why''': the existence of this process is related to the need of  converting  general  into company  useful data; we need to translate context events into an internal useful language.

'''Who''': people can be involved in this process both as process and state definition resources. As we shall discuss later (How) methods can be various and this implies that the relative importance of the various actors is quite different. Going back to the various roles, we can point:

* People supplying data are the same collecting them or market search external companies
* People rationalizing customer needs: marketing, product or market managers as this is a very delicate operation which needs high technology competence and market knowledge. Maybe  a better name could be “product/service” analyst.
* People interpreting: in the fashion-product environment they are called “stylists” and they merge context, unstructured, informations with marketing data with a view for a long time horizon.

The relative role of these people is obviously related to the company market positioning: in a luxury company the stylist role is prevalent compared to the same in a large mass market enterprise.

 People using these data are people in the design and supply chain of the company.

'''What'''. As we said customer need is made up of physical objects (the product),subjective aspects (personal esteem) and social requests.

As far as product requests we can divide between “upgrading”, variations on existing themes, and “innovation”  which relate to requests which did not exist or did not have an answer in the former technological context. This last need is the most difficult one to satisfy as it implies the ability to interpreter social sign which could have an impact on future customer desires.

Subjective needs can be divided into “Basic” messages related to the “universal” nature of man, for example ease-of-use, comfort, functionality and “culture related” messages linked to the context the man lives in, for example color choice and matching which are very related to the society the consumer lives in.

Social messages: our aim is to be able to quantify social attention and recognition and social reputation.

At the moment these are very vague parameters.

'''Where'''. As far as the geographical location where the process exists we must keep track of two aspects:

where the process actually takes place, mainly the company main site, and where the process results are used, typically we are talking about the localization of the results. At the moment the most common ways to proceed on the topic include either local analysis and central strategic consolidation or central analysis and local adaption. Unfortunately both solutions tend to have a “time to market” too long and this reduces the competitiveness of the system, we shall get back on this.

'''How'''. As soon as we start talking about analyzing data, so that they become information, the first thought is about data-warehousing, data-mining and, eventually, knowledge management. In reality we are now trying to rationalize and interpret needs and not hidden or explicit correlations. The problem is thus quite bigger and it must include also informations different from what we have in our standard information systems.   From a methodological point of view we can divide analysis into 

* Rational: taxonomies and  abstraction/interpretation methods and instruments. This last group include projections (defined schema and historical data) and previsions (new schemas on historical data)
* Semi-quantitative: analysis of competitors, market semantic analysis
* Irrational or context analysis.

 Usually all methods are taken into consideration as we try to avoid theoretical models which could be not complete or intuition with no relation with reality.

It could be very interesting, at the moment I know of no tries, using heuristic techniques for the solution of interpretation models; I guess model are still not formal enough.

'''''''''When'''.  From the time point of view we must consider two different horizons: the analysis period and the time the results are meaningful. 

As a rule of thumb it is correct that the analysis should be done at the same time of the data collection as it might turn out that some data are incomplete or wrong. 

The validity of the result, for the physical part, is related to the total lead time of the product we are considering while it is not clear how long our analysis is valid when we talk about customer service, it could be interesting analyzing this.

'''How much'''. This dimension is always very difficult to quantify. Let us go back to the Maslow pyramid: how much do I need to satisfy level 2 (product) before moving to level 3 (personal needs) ? We assume that this percentage does not need to be 100% as once the homeostatic equilibrium of the lower level is reached, attention will move to the upper level. The point is: solving the lower at 80% and the upper at 50% (assuming that you succeed in measuring it) is better than 90%-40%?

I think it is a company choice to be made.

Altogether we must estimate the need for

* product in terms of which is our reference market, its dimension, our positioning (the quota) and  how much does our product satisfy the market in terms of price/performance
* personal/social aspects: how important and how much do we satisfy them.

'''Instruments'''. Now that we went through all the dimensions of the process of “Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs” we can have a look at the state of art as far as available instruments. We can group them into

* Analytical methods: based on known and recursive data
** Algorithmical and or statistical: at least statistically precise
** Heuristic: model not totally defined
* Contextual methods: using common sensations, even if not measurable and recursive
** Brainstorming
** Top-down or bottom-up methods.
* Individual methods: related to a particular man-environment situation, very often give non-reproducible results, e.g. Zen ispiration.

 As a personal opinion, even though different methods could be seen as provocative to some people (think of a physicist who should use a zen approach), as long as this process gives usable results is should be accepted anyway. Human beings have being using gravity as a force and apples kept falling long before Newton quantified the mathematical model. Man was using heuristic models to create manufacts.  In field of social science maybe we shall never have a Galilean, recursive model  but this does not mean that we must not get better use of data to be informations.

   

''Industrial processes''

A possible way to satisfy customer needs is to use specific processes. This means designing, industrializing, planning and producing garments which satisfy the need.

The group of customer we address can be various, it might vary from a single person (make to order) to a homogenoeus set of people on which we make some sort of “average” consideration; if I am talking about well-off teen-agers I need to make different evaluations and  reasonings from a middle-age low income group.

Ability to satisfy the customer need.

The context is the system customer-company; the process goal is to satisfy all the requests starting from the fact that we know them. In this case the information system is a support system, not a core topic.

'''Why'''. We think that satisfying the customer will give immediate return and future perpestive to the company.

'''What'''. The expected results of the process include

* Product: an increase in physical appeal, reliability and availability of the product; a better looking, better quality and easier to find product.
* Subjectivity needs: a better customer care and satisfaction
* Social needs: a better customer group recognition and individual attention, the customer perception of the company as “trusted partner”.

Obviously these results need to be measured on customer expectation.

'''Who'''. People involved in customer satisfaction includes

* Product: design, industrialization, production, logistics
* Personal needs: sales, after sales, CRM executives, retail
* Social needs: promotion, brand management, public relations.

'''How'''. This point is about techniques to be used for customer satisfaction.

In the product area we are concerned about the processes quoted as “direct” in the Porter chain value model. This area is surely the most studied in organizational modeling, we can quote various methodologies from BPR to Kaizen. It is surely not the goal of this work  to get into this problem, better authors then me have worked on this and you can refer to them. 

Personel needs: the studies concerning this area, in my opinion, are not as structured as in the former area.  As far as I know individual aspects of this field have been evaluated but in a stand-alone context, not in a complete customer relation view. The topics we are talking about concern

Customer centrality and adaption to the market

Product availability impact on sales

Sale channel competence and friendliness

After sales service impact

Customer relation management

Direct approach importance: the shop relation

Customer social needs are, in my knowledge, not the object of quantitative studies. This might depend on the fact that data collection is very difficult, so we are still at the level of hypothesis and specific experience collection. We are talking about:

“group” creation and belonging: brand nature and the role of promotion

brand management  and group life-cycle

public relations and their results

“personal” service.

'''Where''' does the process take place: I think we can define the place where the customer is the location where the process starts. Obviously the customer can be anywhere in the world so we must take this into account. The rest of the process may then take place 

Product: in the stylist studio, in the technical, industrial, loistic and retail areas depending on the specific subprocess

Subjectivity needs: sales, customer service and retail areas

Social needs: anywhere as customers can be everywhere.

All these areas must be informationally connectable.

'''When'''. As for the geographical aspects also for the time-related variables the sinchronicity is very important; if you are late in a subprocess there is little chance that you will be able to recover afterwards. This is the deep meaning when “time to market” has been chosen as the critical variable in the next future, speeding up every single phase might give you the elasticity to cope with unforecasted events which might have disastreous effects.

The real problem, in my opinion, is to balance the time associated with each subprocess.

Product: the total lead time, from the idea to the availability, in the fashion wholesale world, lasts about 8–9 months; this period is actually deeply questioned by e-commerce and its related attitude.

Subjectivity: we can think of

Pre-sales (contacts, reciprocal knowledge)

Sales

After sales (recal and custom loyalty).

These process mainly happen on a few months horizon, a slightly longer period than the product cycle.

Social needs. The process of creating a “group” is fairly quick, the real problem is keeping the “group” alive through many years. In this process the “customer attention and recognition” can only start once you have created the “group” so it takes even longer.

'''How Much'''. The metric we use is about 

Product: Aestethic, quality, availability, cost and accepted price 

Subjectivity needs: service, reassurance, empathy

Social needs: how much does the “group” means, how much am I recognized inside the “group”.

As far as the “product” indeces there are quantitative data available related to quality (Aql methodology, number of returns), availability (question sheets and lost sales) and price positioning (sales to full price ratio). As far as I know there are no indeces related to aestetichs, maybe only the number of collection presented  items which never got produced.

Speacking about “service indeces” we have to divid “service quality” and “satisfaction index” (Oliver 1997).  The first is related to external indeces and standard measuring techniques (SERVQUAL, SERVPERF) while the second is related to customer perception. The fact that customer gets in the analysis of the index, introduces two further variables related to time (quality has a fairly long horizon, perception short) and space (consumers in different countries and context have different perception of “satisfaction”).

As far as I know there are no quantitative analysis related to “group belonging” or “group recognition”.

'''Instruments'''

The most well known instruments existing today surely cover the areas of product definition  (PDM) and production controlling (ERP); there are good instruments in forecasting, CRM and sales support.

Getting into details and assuming these are my personal opinions:

Product definition: there are good products helping the product definition (style, PLM, model marking, quality control) and they support time-phased georaphy problems via distributed workflows

* Production processes: definitely the best studied and supported area; you can find instruments (ERPs) very well done both on the theoretical foundaments and technical aspects. The only doubts are about their operational easiness and friendliness.
* Distribution instruments: not at the same level as the ERP but on the right way to be there.

Subjectivity needs support instruments:

* Customer relation: some good CRM package is available but it is still a long way to go to be really complete
* After sale support: it is considered the sales minor process so it has not been developed so much
* Retail. Very good in the operational aspects, not so much for the remaining subprocesses.

Customer social needs: available instruments are essentially question papers statistically analysed; there is no automatic data collection.

Talking about information systems I would like to return to a concept which I think very important. As customers are distributed all over the world, particular care must be taken at every level of integration, not just the technical one (Miotto etc.) if we want to avoid dangereous misunderstandings. Information integration is usually underestimated even though it is well known (Davenport) the importance that information technology had in process disintermediation.

  

Ability to communicate the capacity of satisfying the need

The system is the customer-company environment; the process goal is the fact that the customer ( “group of customers”  to be addressed by my “solution”) is aware that a solution to his needs exists.

'''Why'''. We want the customer to be really aware of the existence of a solution of its limits because real customer service is respectful of customer identity and does not mislead facts.

'''What''' do I communicate, what is the content of the process.

* The knowledge of product content: aesthetics, reliability, availability and price/performance
* The fact that it is really that “product” that satisfies his need (whether primitive or induced)
* The context knowledge about expectation satisfaction, something like saying “come with us and you will be all right”
* The “group” belonging and brand identification
* The “group” recognition.

Regarding this last point we must be very careful about privacy issues, to know each person individually means knowing a lot of informations about him and this might not be compliant with local laws and/or create relation problems with the customer as he feels controlled and classified.

'''Who '''is involved in the process. The customer is the “receiving” (destination, output) part of the process and the company is the active (input) part. Obviously when we talk about customer we must keep in mind all the categories we have been talking about (known, unknown, potential) and calibrate methods and politics for each group.

'''Where''' does the process take place. As we noted companies and customers can be anywhere so the process must be geographically distributed. As far as places where the process takes place we can recognize:

Product: media and PR (testimonials etc.)

Subjectivity: direct sales channel (retail), indirect sales channel (wholesaler), other various channels including word of mouth 

Social: media, retail and PRs.

'''How '''we communicate the information.

Product: direct advertising (I show the product and associate it at human sense), indirect advertising (for example technical people explain characteristics, I get attracted by the person and through him I get to the product); comparative advertising.

Subjectivity: service advertising ( we show our customer service level), the level of professionalism and availability of our sales executive, the product context (packaging, advertising campaign), the service context (POP material, shop furniture and look).

Social promotion: social involvement (e.g. Toscani’s photos per Benetton), fashion shows, licensing, media, internet community, sales point formats, sponsoring; everything which helps creating a “group”. For “group recognition” we must think in terms of personal service.

'''When'''. The time factor in communication is quite different for each need:

Product: the timing is related to the availability (shop, internet or other); it is useless and wrong to communicate a capacity which does exist in reality so it is very important to synchronize ability to communicate and satisfaction capacity

Subjectivity main issue is “trust” which is a long asset to create and a quick one to be destroyed; its time scale is even longer than fashion and style as it might get through different stages of the company; usually it is years long

Social issues, in my opinion, are linked to the idea of “styles”; they are linked to “cultural break” and easiness of information exchange has deeply changed the time scale which I would indicate in a two-three years  period.

'''How much''' we need to communicate means defining the quantity of actions related to each former dimension. In the next chapter we shall propose a view where this dimension is actually related to the evaluation of the cost/return I have in each combination of variables. We know that evaluating the cost is feasible, not easy but usually can be done, while evaluating the return is very hard and it is usually done through side indicators like sale increase. I think there is a lot of work to be done in evaluating measurable parameters.

'''Instruments''': we partially quoted them in the “how” paragraph, we are talking about publicity and PRs. As far as I know there are no instruments, now, able to quantify, as an example, the return of the investment of a fashion show in terms of social impact on the knowledge of a “brand”.

 

Industry: the architecture of the solution

To organize what we have been saying up to now, we have to create a schema including, for each process, every possible combination of the information dimensions we have been considering. Some of these combinations might be nonexistent like “sure needs of potential customers”. 

As an example of the operational method we can have tables like this one:

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Need data collection&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Analysis&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Satisfaction&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Communication&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;Process&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Product'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Subjectivity'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Sociality'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Imagine the first process of need data collection,  here we can ask ourselves which are the needs 

Of a well known customer

Collected by a sale executive who transmit them

Semi-structured needs

Collected in a shop

With a very clear question

At the beginning of a sale campaign

Which means that we are considering one of all possible combinations of parameters.

Later in the book we shall get check how many are the meaningful combinations (Appendix A).

 In this way we are segmenting the total information problem in “cells” each of which has its own individual analysis of states and processes parameters. 

In this method we are not really taking into consideration the “when” and “why” dimension. The “when” variable is related to the variation of the schema in time: an open issue. The “why” parameter, at the top level, is human related and, in my opinion, has the basic meaning of the actual nature of economical enterprise, but this is also an open issue.

This schema reminds us of the phase-space in statistical mechanics where the cell weight is not even but it is related to the weight the company gives to it in its strategy. As in statistical mechanics the content of the cell is a function of both the initial state and the state variation rule (the process), assuming a first order non explicit time dependence. 

As far as the cost of cell fulfillment we can imagine a curve like this:

Where the cost to satisfy 100% is very high. The growth coefficient depends on the nature of the cell and it should be the result of specific analysis which locate the cell in the total analysis space.

When we talk about the value and the cost of an analysis cell we must not forget the reliability of the data we are using in terms of data collection, methods and people involved. This makes things very difficult when you think of a global solution so most companies, in my opinion have been using two side methods:

* What do other people do ( market driven policies)
* What is it going to happen if  I don’t do this (scare of “not doing”).

The method I propose, not forgetting the associated difficulties, is to break down the problem into specific cells and define local strategies in a wider architecture.

I really think that a complete semantic ontology of all cells, including time and space dependence, is a non realistic result so I propose a local approach using also heuristic techniques.

'''The company strategic plan then becomes'''

* '''Assigning a value to each cell of the “customer needs” phase space'''
* '''Trying to associate a cost to the fulfillment of that cell'''
* '''Maximize the phase space covered with the constraint of the company total resources and define the attitude regarding the cells which are not considered for this moment.'''

From an information system point of view, in practice we need to quantify, for each cell,

The weight it has, related to company strategy

The value of information relative to the cell based on a definite metric system

The cost of getting that information.

The total combination gives the information scenario for the company. 

The time factor shows its importance both in fact that the context keeps changing and also in the fact that no company starts from scratch; usually there is an  information patrimony specially in the areas of product needs satisfaction (sales and production). The critical strategy factor now becomes the ability to choose the best solution for choosing the variation of customer phase space as to reach the best overall coverage.

From a practical point of view we start from the highest level four processes, get down to the individual cells and determine the actual company value, the cost of maintenance  and the cost of upgrading.

''It could be interesting to compare the structure of this analysis with the deployment of software projects. The phases of needs collection and rationalization is very well known in the enterprise software production while it is very little formalized in manufacturing.  On the other end the phase of capability communication is much more developed in the industry context.''

  
''Retail Processes''

We define “retail” as the set of processes which satisfy the availability need in a customer related space-time context. The difference between this set and the previous one is 

# The subject of the process, the retailer, does not satisfy the need starting from designing and projecting the answer from scratch but he tries to solve the problem choosing the  solution, among those on the market, which he thinks will better fit customer requests (sales methodology)
# The relation between retailer and final customer is much more “direct” than in the industrial case so many “non product” aspects are more important.

We can see the retail process from three different point of view:

# Final customer: form this point of view “retail” is simply the availability  in a “local” form; needs and data collection are the same as for the industrial environment
# Retailer: problems concern both to satisfy customers (purchasing and selling) and to relate to the context
#  Context: this relates to how “retail processes” exist in the society both as time phased phenomena (geography = shops, shopping centers; communication etc.) and structure (fiscal and legal compliances)

From the customer point of view “retail” is a service process centered around the actual sale moment but we must remember that it really consists of before sale, actual sale and after sale (preparation, actuation and conclusion).

'''Process Analysis: the customer point of view'''

We know that, generally speaking, customer needs are:

Product        Aesthetics, reliability, availability

Subjectivity    Problem solving, reassurance, empathy

Sociality    group belonging, individual recognition

And that, for each need, direct processes imply:

* Data collection for all the data levels and views
* Analysis and method rationalization to be more efficient and precise
* Satisfaction given by the fulfillment of the need of the real product or of feeling
* Communication which means the ability to communicate the possibility of satisfaction.

The actual need coverage is through the balancing of these factors.

 From the market point of view, the weight of each parameters corresponds to the positioning of the company in the market share.

In the following table we can see how a group of users has quantified their expectations as a function of the sales channel

''Process analysis: the retailer point of view''

 From the point of view of a retailer, the definite question is:

“why does a customer comes to me and how can I satisfy him ‘”

Which means “which are the customer needs and why does he feel that I can satisfy them ?”.

In the world of retail the contact is not with a “customer” but with a “specific customer”, this means that subjective and social needs are very much stressed compared to anonymous relations. It happens that shops may live on “local” emotional realities (mono or multibrand wholesalers), some other times they have a more “diffuse” approach (department stores, large distribution). 

The birth of a “sales project”, to satisfy a particular customer need at any level of Maslow scale, then is the result of a sales enterprise which evaluates the market opportunities in terms of the lack of a product in a certain area/time, the availability of structures (shops), a new sales method or the existence of an unexploited sociality.

We start from our daily experience to group elementary processes into categories; this will help us in the functional analysis of the retail system.  Processes are sets of actions which satisfy needs whether these needs concern customers, retailers or the context. We assume that, if a process exists, it must have some meaning otherwise it would not exist any longer. Not every possible process exists or, sometime, we are not aware that it exists.

Our methodology starts from listing the processes and then looking for their value on customer needs; we must be very careful to distinguish between “real” value and “customer perceived” value; customer are only interested, and ready to pay for,  in the second ones while there could be processes (e.g. finance control)   which have no value for the final customer but are very important for the retailer. We shall be using the “perceived value” parameter.

To be completely correct from a methodological point of view we should define each process to the very detail, in fact we adapt to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of a process, this means that the value of a process is a function of 

* The relative importance of the customer need (what I satisfy)
* The perceived value of the solution: the expectation (how much I satisfy it).

In the following tables:

Processes are grouped by areas

Coding is such that

Effect on the process: H = high, M = medium, L = low, blank = not applicable

Grouping level: C = customer, G = group, T = context

Area: P = product, S = subjectivity, C = sociality, O = organization, F = fiscal

'''Customer need – process existence relation'''

Let us look at the processes we just quoted (remind that needs belong only to the final customer); to fulfill them we need to operate on three different levels (not to be confused with operating entities):

* Single customer
* Customer group : customers of one specific sale point which means how the local retailer organizes the service
* Context: general aspects of service which means how is the general service defined, how to handle general topics ranging from product presentation to fiscal procedures.

The “retail” system does not consists only of processes related to customer relation but it has to cope with many levels of activities; this is the meaning of the “group” attribute in the former table.

Retail support systems: the information processes.

We speak explicitly of “support” and not of software because,  as you can saw from the process listed, the content is not a pure “data” parameters but if often connects to physical or psychological aspects.

We also saw that final customer  and retailer needs somehow differ both in content and in relative weight. 

From an industry point of view the retailer is “the customer” and this is why we need to understand which are the needs he needs to satisfy and he is willing to pay if satisfied.

We can think of retailer needs general schema as:

What we derive from this table is that “single”, “final” customer needs have been largely disappointed in the industrial attitude; companies tend to focalize on “customer groups” as their ability to solve needs is essentially related to product/social  and not to subjectivity capabilities.

This aspect of the end customer need is mainly covered by the “retail” structure.

To be methodologically correct we should now take into consideration all the 32 cells; out of these only 6 (“customer group”, data collection and analysis) have already been taken into consideration in the industrial analysis. In the following pages we shall group some cells to avoid being too long even though we realize that we make a methodological approximation.

'''''''''Customer processes'''

Personal needs are, by definition, very “personal” so they need a very “local” application of general principles stated by the company. The information content is actually very little formalized: we are moving in a very unexplored field.

'''''Product: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are talking about the behavior of a specific customer in a specific sale situation: a very elementary context.

* What: we are looking at the relation between the customer and the garment he is evaluating;
* How: which are the parameters to decide “will the garment fit the customer expectations ?”  or even better: “will the garments satisfy the customer need?”
* Who: the actors involved in the process = the customer and the retailer
* Where does the process take place?  typically a real shop but it could be a virtual one
* When does the concurrence of product/customer occurs ? presence of both customer and product
* How much is the customer need satisfied: this is perhaps the most difficult parameters to measure directly
* Why: this the company strategy.

Assuming that we want to satisfy customer need, I think that the only information instrument which can be used is the sales executive capacity to support requests on product (fashion, quality)  and customer (decision process). Time length and variability of relation, in my opinion, make impossible for a formal information system to be really useful.

Measuring system can only be indirect through a total evaluation of the sale executive.  

'''''Product: communication'''''

The aim of this process is to make the specific customer understand that it is possible to help him in choosing the right product. Assuming that we think that the correct local instruments are sales executive, we want the customer to trust sales executive in their knowledge of product and can help him in determining the product coverage of his needs.

* What: sale executive product competence
* How: must be explicit and customer must recognize it
* Who: the information instrument is the sale executive or, at most, the store manager
* Where: in the sale area, this means physical availability of the vendor
* When: during real and prospect sales
* How much: as far as I know there is actually no formal system of measuring this process, maybe through customer interview
* Why: because it satisfies the customer.

As far as information supports, we must give the actual instrument (the sale executive) the knowledge he needs both on the product he is selling and on competitors so that he can help the customer to judge correctly the answer to his needs.

'''''Subjectivity: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are  talking about elementary processes which concern ability to answer, personal assurance and empathy to a particular customer.

* What: as we are discussing of very individual, peculiar data. I think that the signals and the collection method are very difficult to categorize, we could try to classify the results. From a practical point of view we should define the results we want and leave to the sale executive the method to collect the data regarding customer individual feeling etc.
* How:  we could start from classifying (based on our experience) customer approach and check the results of possible general support standards we offer
* Who: people involved are sales executive and store managers (control level)
* Where: every possible customer relation, mainly in sales area
* When: before, during and after the sale
* How much: a possible measure of unit could be store manager evaluation
* Why: because customer must be at ease from a human relation point of view.

Information support: The sale executive must be empathetic with the specific customer so he must fit his way of acting to the actual situation. Information content must then relate to the sociological world of sales and, eventually, to the social and fashion trends.

'''''Subjectivity: communication'''''

* What: we want to communicate that a customer feels at ease in a particular context. It is a very personal phenomena and it is related mainly to the sale executive empathy, to the sale place format and to the brand image.
* How: the most important means I know of are word-of-mouth messaging and architecture design
* Who: mainly the sale executive, also every other company employee
* Where: mainly the shop but also the general social context
* When: it is important to note that both actual sales but also prospect and possible sales are extremely important for this topic
* How much: I think that only customer interviews can be a measuring instrument
* Why: to get returning customers.

This topic is fairly delicate because customer expectations can be very different from company policy and very often we saw a large gap between the two approaches.

'''''Sociality: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

* What: the content of this point is about the customer feeling himself recognized and accepted
* How:  the whole process starts from customer receiving and recognition which must be precise. In the case of recognition this can be done through formal instruments (fidelity cards) or informal ones (the sales executive memory). In any case there must be standard procedures for each case.
* Who: this is mainly a sales executive job
* Where:  Typically the sales area; it is an interesting topic to understand what this means in a distributed location (internet)
* When: always, during real or prospect sales
* How much: a possible way of measuring this data could be the number of visit a customer does whether they became a real sale or not
* Why: to create a nicer environment for our customers.

From an information system point of view the first problem is related to customer recognition. Sometimes we can find some sort of “fake” personal recognition (e.g. intimate friendship) which annoys the customer, the real cases I can think of are either related to the high luxury environment, where quite a few customers are well known from social news, or small local retail with a consolidated personal knowledge of the customers. In other contexts we must rely on some personal interactions supported by CRM systems not to loose company knowledge.

'''''Sociality: communication'''''

* What: we are talking about the fact that a customer knows he will be recognized and helped
* How: on this topic we can think of formal communication systems like advertising but my opinion is that the best way is word-of-mouth and group diffusion
* Who: people involved are mainly sales executives and store managers
* Where: the sales place and the logical surroundings
* When: during the whole relation with the customer (pre, actual and after sale)
* How much: a possible indicator could be the number of contacts; both ways and any possible content
* Why: because it helps satisfying the customer.

The information object includes the content (“welcome”),  the form (direct or indirect message) and the destination (actual or prospect customers).

 

'''

'''Group processes

Customer group needs are those industry relates to. As far as data collection and analysis processes, we can refer to the first part of the book as we are talking about collecting and categorize common customer needs; retail is a different way of solving them.

'''Product – satisfaction.'''

* What: the topic is about product availability  in the whole time cycle including after sales. We should divide the process in purchasing, stocking, shelf availability and after sales. Problems concern offer analysis, purchasing operational, sales space limitation as we assume that bulk storage is not a retail problem; the whole system is the retail industrial chain.
* How: operations through subprocesses of purchasing, exhibition, sales and after sales service.
* Who: people involved includes merchandiser, buyers, sales executive and customer service.
* Where: any site of the company
* When: we can estimate a few months period
* How much: the whole process is so large that I think the only summary indicators we can use is the economical turnaround of the enterprise unit (shop etc.); subprocesses can be individually measured.
* Why: this is seen as the real nature of the retail structure, could not be the only one.

Customer satisfaction is “the process” of a retail system as it has to conjugate market availability and specific customer request. From an information point of view it asks for a huge amount of informations (see appendix B).

'''Product – communication'''

What: we are talking about the process which makes the customer understand that, in that place and at the right moment, he will find the answer to his product needs (group level). We thus deal with an information content.

How: we can use formal systems (commercials, press, window presentation) or informal (word-of-mouth) in large social contexts and personal systems (human relations) in limited environments.

Who: usually we cope with professionals in large scales and sales executive in small environment.

Where: Social contexts mean the whole society, up to world scale, and especially in aggregation area while small environment means essentially shops.

When: product satisfaction is not a one shot process, it needs to be created before and fed also after sale, this means that communication has to be time calibrated.

How much: without any communication product access is essentially stochastic so we can have  a first guess relating amount of communication to sales increase.

Why: because it might be that the customer doesn’t know that we can solve his need.

This whole topic should  be analyzed by itself.

'''Subjectivity  - satisfaction'''

* What: in this group we can identify a few topics. We can identify the role of the sales executive (technical expertise, personal attitude, follow up), customer-context relations (shop image, goods location and availability), customer-company relation (commercial, shop windows). They are all the result of how the company has imagined its relation with the customer.
* How: customer satisfaction can thus be a result of how we support
** Sale executive competence both on product and relation
** Context design and product merchandising
** Space positioning, visual merchandising and commercial.
* Who: persons involved include sales executive and sales structure managers to project the sale process
* Where: both in the shop and in the company studios
* When: a real sale experience does not last a moment, we must create a long lasting customer relation
* How much: I think one of the parameters we should consider is customer retention and find a way to measure it (e.g. fidelity cards)
* Why: we want to satisfy every aspect of our customers.

Informations related to this process are various and need a separate study.

'''Subjectivity – communication'''

What: this topic is about how we can communicate our ability in satisfying customer subjectivity

* How:
** sales executive: after the specific training, we must communicate our employees ability in a formal way to the market (group of customers)
** customer – context: after the design of a comfortable shop environment we must be very strict in assuring that the standard is kept
** customer-company: like before we must underline our ability in individual attention.
* Who:  people involved include sales executive and communicators.
* Where: we must act any place a prospect can be but especially near shops, as to use take advantage of existing structures.
* When: we are not talking of a specific product so there is no definite time zone, it is a continuous job with peaks when no specific product is to be advertised
* How much: I think we could use the number of visiting people in our shops as an indicator
* Why: to cover any aspect of subjectivity need.

The information request set is too large to be analyzed here, further studies are needed.

''' Sociality – satisfaction'''

This process is concerned with smaller groups of customers than those addressed by industry, retail is more “locally” concerned either from a geographical (customer in a certain area) or from a social (customer of a certain type) point of view.

* What: the aim is to create a sense of belonging so that the customer refers to the shop, also maybe not for purchasing
* How: the attachment may be induced either directly (direct marketing) or indirectly (social signs)
* Who: it is usually a PR person working on these topics
* Where: the place is related to the sale method (place or market type)
* When: the time base is fairly long as it implies personal involvement
* How much: a possible parameter to measure such a process could be the number of visit, whether for purchase or not, to the company locations
* Why: it is not so easy to create the “social” concept of the retailer, especially for multi-brand retailers who do not share a company support.

Let get into more details for this area. Our analysis could take into consideration:

Customer reasoning:

What qualifies myself from the context?

How much does belonging to that group cost ?   

Which are the group identities and testimonials?

How can I avoid being considered “standard” and yet belong to the group?

Retailer reasoning

How much does it cost to create the “group”?

How much does it cost to maintain the “group identity”?

How much do I get in terms of new customers or upsales form the “group”?

Generally which is the “group” trade off?

I think we can look at two possible ways of approaching the problem:

Internal: a “group” needs to have times and places it can exists (like happy hours in bars etc.) and archetypes it can recognize, testimonials defining the “group characters”

External: a “group” needs symbols like shopping bags or reserved events.

From an information point of view we can measure

Customer retention both in number and quantity

New customers entries

PR costs.

These data are very difficult to obtain as they are much perturbed by product data, at the moment I do not know of reliable analysis on this topic.

'''Sociality – communication'''

While industry communication is essentially based on product, retail communication underline the idea of service, of problem solving. This idea implies that it is more of an institutional then technical communication.

* What: I want to tell people that my “group” is a “happy community” and you can join it.
* How: the mean is related to the market I am heading, no general rule.
* Who: the person who acts is mainly a PR, the customer receives.
* Where: the main targets are customers and prospects so it has to be evaluated where to spend the money; internet is a world situation
* When: if you act just once it is dangerous: the customer asks himself why of these expenses; the “group” communication has be lasting in time as it connect people and it has to create trustworthiness
* How much: let us divide customers and prospects. Customer are to be steadily reminded, the parameter we could measure is customer retention. Prospects are to be invited, we could neasure new entries as a function of expenses.

The informations we need to control are various and often not explicit : imagine we talk of teen-agers buying clothes. Clothes are not just a way of dressing,  it is also a request for meeting similar. This means that a shop is a meeting point and it has to fulfill this need so that the teen-ager likes to stay in the shopping area. Places where you can only buy, in my opinion, have little chance against the web-offer, on the other hand satisfaction places are more expensive than normal shops.

From an information point of view the problem is thus to quantify the ratio between the capacity of satisfying customer social need and economical balance.

  

'''

'''Context processes

Context processes group all those operations which have no direct relation with the customer so these processes create no customer perceived value but are necessary for enterprise functioning.

A rough classification could divide them into “fiscal” processes (related to external existing rules and laws) and “organizational” (related to process “best practices” in the business area).

Context process are the one which are best known from an informational point of view as they derive either from formal rules (fiscal) or from repetitive experience (organizational); they are also the best information system supported processes. It is not the aim of this paper to describe more deeply this set of processes; I only would like to point out that, as they create no customer value, they must be considered a pure cost driver and the information system goal should be to satisfy the enterprise need reducing these costs. Typically this goal is achieved using methodologies as standard as possible introduced in the company via education and/or consultancy.

Retail: the solution architecture

As we discussed in the industry part of this paper, in retail also we can create a schema for the set of processes related to the company information strategy. The matrix needs-functions is the retail phase space where each cell has its own cost and value; the complete figure is the company positioning strategy.

Some of these cells need to analyzed at a more specific level (e.g. group-product  satisfaction) ì; we should then sum the subprocesses cost to derive the total cell cost while the value is available only at an upper level.

We can think at the “true value” of the need as the product of the need importance multiplied by the channel expectation for the market we are operating, we find a result like the following table:

Based on this schema,  a retailer, as long has he decided which one is his operating channel, can find the relative value of customer need, his problem is now to decide “how much do I want to invest in satisfying this request”.

As we saw, each of these cell is made of many elementary processes with its own contribution to the final cost; this allows us to derive total cost as the sum of the whole solution.

The information technology goal is both to detail the information content and the analysis of a single subprocesses and to reduce the cost of each of the processes  itself using technology in the right way (where possible).

It is obvious that we start from processes which have the highest customer value so that they have  a quicker return.

'''''

'''''Conclusion''

The aim of this work is look for a schema in the structure of information  processing in a consumer industry. Personally I think we can recognize four types of consumer industry:

Physical goods with industrial origin (apparel, shoes, cars)

Physical goods for personal satisfaction (perfumes)

Services (non material goods) with industrial origin (security)

Services for personal satisfaction (films, bodycare).

Foe each type of industry organizational best practices, KPIs and data collection instruments have been defined but I believe that, up to now, information systems have developed only a local coverage related  to immediate needs or to the existence of a single cell information model. 

Looking at the whole information context it turns out that quite a few cell have information characteristics (timing, number of data, algorithms) that make a complete formal model unfeasible to exist. It turns out more useful to adopt a simplifying  approach and reengineer the process.

Sometimes the general approach is not possible also because it might happen that you are still defining the  elementary process. In particular there are many cells not covered by information models and instruments; most of these situation occurs from historical priorities or from lack of technical instruments.

In my opinion we could derive that

I think that, actually, the whole part related to customer subjectivity and sociality is left to the retailer experience and intuition. This attitude implies that satisfaction indexes are bound to be very inaccurate and inefficient. 

Obviously the relative weight of the various cells is related to the context we are working and, up to now, the “product” cells have been the most important.

In a globalized world were access to product will be eased by technical instruments, other factors will become more and more important so we shall get to analyze them.

We also need to stress that subjectivity and sociality assume a fairly different meaning in the internet world and this aspect is completely unknown at the moment.

'''Appendix B 

'''Processes – customer group level''': here we can have more “general” (e.g. sale market analysis, purchasing) and more “specific”  topics (e.g. shop emotional paths definition); this might change the level of standardization we can find. Let us consider a fundamental retail need:

Customer group level: product-satisfaction.

In this part we consider the processes regarding availability of the product for the whole time period, including after sale. We can spot the following subprocesses:

* Market offer analysis
* Purchasing
* Stock management
* Sales area availability
* After sale behavior.

Assuming that request analysis (what does the customer group wants) has already been done, we want to use those informations.

'''Market offer analysis'''

In this process we match what the market offers with what our customers want. This process mainly takes place in two different ways:

Catalogue analysis

Physical analysis

''Catalogue analysis''

* What: we want to find, in the market we have access (first constraint), the product which best gets near to our objective in terms of
** Nature (clothing type and category)
** Technological properties (composition etc.)
** Aesthetical and fashion parameters
** Price range
** Supplier characteristics (reliability etc.)
* How: this process used to be, and partially still is, fulfilled via information channels like technical papers or physical agents
* When: the search is made essentially when a new collection is introduced so there is little time for changing and this creates markets rigidities
* Where: a multibrand retailer has limited possibilities to make real geographical analysis, we are talking of a fairly strict constraint on this point
* Who: the real actor is the buyer, in small entities this corresponds very often to the seller
* How much: with the actual information systems this process is fairly slow, we might think of using, as a measuring parameters, the number of suppliers taken into consideration
* Why: we want to increase the knowledge of the market offer

This is a process in which there are very large possibilities of increasing the information quality, maybe standardizing the offer methodology; the problem seems to be related to multibrand confusion.

Physical analysis

* What: in this process the retailer checks the correspondence  of initial informations and controls certain unavailable data (garment fit, fabric real color)
* How: the process takes place where the physical garment is available (fairs, show rooms)
* When: the time must be compatible with market requests
* Where: as said, in fairs, show rooms or agents information points
* Who: people involved includes buyers and offering companies
* How much: it could be interesting measuring the distance between the catalogue offering and the real offer; we should interview the customers
* Why: to reduce wasted times

The information system support for this process is, in my knowledge, near to zero. The goal could be a historical feedback system for operators.

''Purchasing''

This process begins after product choice and includes operations related to purchase order creation and control. It is a standard industrial process which we only quote quickly without even getting into details like quotation, offer and order confirmation. 

* What: it is the process of defining the characteristics of the supply in terms
** Physical: goods to be delivered, place and date of delivery, delivery context (packing, labeling etc.)
** Non physical: terms of payment, quality standard, information data.
* How: operational aspect of the purchase order (paper, electronic data interchange)
* When: purchase order can be made in various moments: fairs, later back home
* Where: as before it depends on customer/supplier organization
* Who: entities involved include customer, supplier and, sometimes, third parties like agents or credit companies
* How much: process dimension could not be related to the economical amount (think of small boutiques buying many codes and little quantities) but we could think in terms of SKUs
* Why: it is a steady state both from the physical and the information point of view.

From the information systems point of view, this is one of the best known process and there is plenty of knowledge on it.

''Stock management''

In this process, after we have chosen and ordered the garments, we are to keep track of the physical location.

* What: the process is about knowing where the goods are; they could be at the supplier, in transit, in the warehouse or in the sale area
* How: our system must help us in giving the situation both at the moment and in the next future (e.g. passage from transit to warehouse)
* When: the system must be available always and must give response on inventories at any time
* Where: the process must support people anywhere it is needed, both locally (shops, warehouses) and remote (company headquarter)
* Who: there are operational actors (shop executives, warehouse employee) and control people
* How much: it is obvious that precision is a must; sometime fiscal limits are law defined
* Why: sales points are part of a larger system designed for customer satisfaction.

We need an information system which gives you the situation in any part of the customer dedicated world (supplier, logistics, shops); at the moment we are not yet in this situation.

''Sales area availability''

This point is about the way goods are to be shown so that customer probabilities, to find what he is looking for, get higher.

* What: as we know what the inventory is, we need to balance space vs. goods and to define exposition priorities (paths and areas)
* How: the choices we make must match customer needs and quantities taking into consideration that we might have to cope with missing quantities to be filled in the future
* When: the matching process between goods and space is obviously related to goods availability (spaces are generally fixed on the short term) and to customer visit frequency. It is usually considered a two-three weeks period.
* Where: where the sale takes place
* Who: usually it a is a visual merchandiser job, in smaller sales entities it is a senior sale executive job
* How much: department stores have long studied this problem, it is not in the aim of this paper to get into it
* Why: no doubt a good explosion helps the customer in finding what he is looking for.

From an information point of view, data concern customer and product presence (actual and future), customer revisit attitude and product appeal on the local market.

''After sale behavior.''

To satisfy the customer we must also project to implement after sale behaviors. After sale has two main components: returns and follow-up.

Returns

* What: we are essentially dealing with garments with quality standards not as expected
* How: returns are mainly processed via a shop physical hand back and the substitution with another garment or a refund
* How much: timing is mainly law defined and it might last from a few days (unsatisfaction) to months (quality problems)
* Where: the return process usually happens where the sale process took place
* Who: acting people include the customer, the retailer and the garment company
* How much: it is easy to be measured and, obviously, should be as little as possible
* Why: because this process is somehow part of the sale process, it is a side effect

Follow up

* What: this process help us in defining our new sales standards, it should measure the difference between the relation perception at the sale moment and later in time
* How: we must identify customer correspondence between customer expectation and real result
* Where: we have to be able to re-reach our customers where they stay
* Who: this process is available only for trackable customers so we much try to increase this number
* How much: to be statistically significant
* Why: to drive future sales processes

As far as information system is concerned, returns is a typical summary process so it needs operational and control systems while follow-up is also an analytical process.

Hello. My name is Downdate (as the page name suggests). I write, draw and play with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro|Blender 3D]].

It is because of this obsession with Blender that I started work on Wikibooks. I have started and continue to work on [[Beyond Blender Render|Beyond Blender Render: A Guide To Blender Gaming]]. This book talks about how to use the Blender Game Engine. Anyone who wishes to help with this book, please do.

Cheers,

Note on this chapter: The majority is taken up with descriptions of logic bricks. To fastforward to the work click [[#Add_Some_Logic|Here]]

==What's What?==
Let me explain how each logic brick works.

===Sensors===
First there are sensors. These sense for something (such as keyboard presses or mouse clicks but not the neighbour's cat) and activate the [[#Controllers|controllers]].

====Actuator sensor====
The actuator sensor detects if a particular actuator has been set off.

====Always sensor====
The always sensor basically means Always do this.

====Collision sensor====
Like touch but works with properties instead of materials.

====Delay sensor====
Delay sensor is activated after a set amount of time.

====Joystick sensor====
Senses joystick movements and presses

====Keyboard sensor====
This detects keyboard presses.

====Message sensor====
This detects messages sent by the message actuator.

====Mouse sensor====
Detects mouse input.

====Near sensor====
Detects if an object with a certain property is nearby.

====Property sensor====
Detects if a property on the current object is equal or between one or two equivalents.

====Radar sensor====
Detects an object with a certain property along a certain access.

====Random sensor====
Triggers so many times per second randomly.

====Touch sensor====
Detects when this object touches another object with a certain material.

===Controllers===
These decide what to do with the signal from the [[#Sensors|sensors]] (such as activate a python script or activate an [[#Actuators|actuator]]).

===Actuators===
These do something with the signal from the [[#Controllers|controllers]] (such as move, start a game or pause this one).

==Add Some Logic==
Okay, time to get to work. Make sure you are on the cube (or what ever you want your hero to be). Add four '''keyboard''' sensors. Next, add four '''and''' controllers. Finally add four '''movement''' actuators.

Now connect the top sensor with the top controller and the top controller with the top actuator. Then connect the second to the top to the second to the top and so on until they are all connected like so:
[[File:Add Logic1.png|600px|center]]
Next look at the top Keyboard Sensor. There should be a button with no text near the top. Click this button and then press the key you want to be Forward in the game. The most common keys for this purpose are &quot;W&quot; and &quot;UpArrow&quot;. Then using the ones below you may set backwards, left and right.
[[File:Logic Add2.png|600px|center]]
Now your logic should look like this.

Now look down your actuator list. You'll see small fields with numbers in them. You can click them to edit their number. They control how much you are moving and in which direction. The fields go in the order of X axis, Y axis and Z axis. The fields with decimals in them are for motion and the fields with ° are for rotation (along the axis of your choice). Set all these to what you see in the above picture.

Note: If the L is on next to the fields that means that they will be Local directions for the object. If the L is not on they shall use global coordinates.

# RTEMS is an open source RTOS.
# RTEMS is an abstraction layer that makes it possible to write an application for one embedded system, and run that application on over 10 chip families and 100 board support packages.
# RTEMS started in 1989, and still has an active development community.
# RTEMS is designed to be a POSIX compliant RTOS, there is less difficulty associated with porting software designed to run on BSD or Linux. (citation needed)

      <text xml:space="preserve">RTEMS uses a patched version on the Gnu tools to compile RTEMS.
This chapter will cover:
# building the RTEMS Toolset
# building/using a bootloader
# configuring RTEMS
# RTEMS Eclipse Plug-in
# using RTEMS on a hardware emulator
# using RTEMS on hardware

=== RTEMS Toolset ===
Although there are pre-built tools that can be installed on some platforms, some developers may desire to install the RTEMS toolset on a different platform, or install a more recent or more mature version of the RTEMS toolset on their machine.

RTEMS applications are designed to run on a different operating system (RTEMS as opposed to Windows, Mac, or Linux) and different hardware than the system the development is done on (such as Sparc, Arm or m68k as opposed to an x86-64).  The tool set is a specially patched and configured version of binutils, newlib, and gcc.  As this is a text book, this material will be presented in a lengthy explanatory fashion—the how-to can be found on the RTEMS website.

First, the platform must support patching code, writing configure scripts from configure.ac meta-scripts, generating Makefiles from Makefile.ams, and compiling the cross-compiler.  Different platforms require different processes to achieve this goal.  Ideally, this text will eventually include how to build the toolset on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

== Getting the RTEMS Toolset ==

To get the RTEMS Toolset follow the directions at
http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMS_Development_Hosts

More on this topic can be found at:

How to build the tools from scratch
http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/Building_the_RTEMS_toolset_on_Ubuntu

Ideas for a Windows Installer:
Using NSIS: see rtems/contrib/mingw at http://git.rtems.org/rtems/tree/contrib/mingw

== Building RTEMS ==
RTEMS has the following switches:
# list and describe them

RTEMS can be built for multiple architectures simultaneously.  For our m68k example, we select the Coldfire architectures (because that is the m68k architecture that QEMU emulates), and the sim68000 (because that's what the RTEMS-GDB runs).
&lt;pre&gt;
../rtems/configure --target=m68k-rtems4.11 --enable-tests=samples --enable-rtemsbsps=all
gmake RTEMS_BSP=&quot;av5282 uC5282&quot;
gmake CC=/opt/rtems-4.11/bin/m68k-rtems4.11-gcc install
&lt;/pre&gt;

== building/using a bootloader ==
This is a stub.  The reason for covering the bootloader is to inform new developers how to get their code to run on a board without binary modification.  Need a table of hardware RTEMS has been ported to and bootloaders that work with them.  Possible reference: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_boot_loaders.

Some references for bootloaders for different architectures can be found in the Debian installer manual 

http://wiki.debian.org/BootLoader

This subsection covers:
=== GRUB ===

=== Micro Monitor ===
A boot loader for a variety of hardware...

Reference material:
http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/MicroMonitor

http://www.microcross.com/html/micromonitor.html

=== SILO ===
=== U-Boot ===
Insert information about the Universal Bootloader (U-Boot).
==== Building U-Boot ====

To compile U-Boot from the source, the typical steps are taken are similar to [http://free-electrons.com/doc/u-boot.pdf free-electrons.com/doc/u-boot.pdf]:
# Look in boards.config for the correct configuration
# Configure U-Boot for the board using '''gmake eb_cpu5282_config'''
# Build U-Boot for the board using '''gmake CROSS_COMPILE=m68k-rtems4.11-'''

=== other bootloaders needed for hardware architectures RTEMS runs on ===

A reference for filling out this section is: http://www.rtems.com/wiki/index.php/Building_Grub and http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/QEMU 

(Documentation will have to be written and posted on another web page first, and cited, so as not to put original work on Wikibooks)
For demonstration purposes, the coldfire-m68k example may use u-boot.
http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot/u-boot-coldfire.git

== RTEMS Eclipse Plug-In ==
This is a stub.  The reason for covering the RTEMS Eclipse Plug-In is to ensure material in the book is forward-looking.  Other RTOSs use integrated development environments, and new RTEMS developers may find using Eclipse increases their productivity.  For filling out this section reference: 

http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMS_Eclipse_Plug-in .

http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMS_Eclipse_Information .

http://www.fogel.ca/2008/10/02/getting-eclipse-and-java-working-on-debian/ .

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6044138/remote-debugging-in-eclipse-cdt

== Using RTEMS on a Hardware Emulator ==

=== Building QEMU ===
Qemu uses the zlib compression library, and the sdl library, which must be installed before building QEMU.
To build QEMU 
This is a stub.  
Reference to draw ideas from for why Qemu:

lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/papers/proc/p09.pdf

The reason for covering a hardware emulator is because some RTEMS developers lack continual access to actual hardware. For filling out this section reference: http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/QEMU
(If possible, running Qemu out of eclipse should be documented elsewhere, such as the RTEMS wiki, and cited, so as not to put original work on Wikibooks, and included in this section)

== Using RTEMS on Hardware ==
This is a stub.  Ideally loading executables on at least two board support packages should be covered. Again, documenting IDE support will be an end-goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Good Practice is an action proven to effectively and efficiently produce expected results. 
In project management, “Good Practice” is a standardized and replicable method of performing an action that can be applied by departments/organizations, having analogous objectives, in order to achieve analogous results.   

The word “practice” is strictly related to the word “theory”.  Any action carried out as a result of a human choice contains:
* a vision =  a theory
and
* an activity that concertizes this vision = a practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Template for describing a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Good practices|Good Practice]]

The structure of a practice includes needs, methods, actors, means and goals, articulated into specific efforts that are aimed at addressing specific needs and achieving expected goals.

“Good practice” is used to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that different departments/organizations can use and/or apply.

''Executive Summary - A Snapshot''
:1.	Context
:2.	Problems Addressed
:3.	Successes Achieved (how problems were solved)
:4.	Activities Implemented (how success was achieved)
:5.	Steps and Phases in implementation (how activities were carried out)
:6.	Intermediate Results and other Milestones of implementation steps
:7.	Key Performance Indicators
:8.	Risks and Limitations
:9.	Scope for Replication
:10.	Tools for dissemination and streamlining

The description of a good practice is therefore accurate if:
* it reveals how it has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means;
* its methodology is sufficiently accurate and appropriate so that others can replicate it;
* it reveals how it can evolve to become better as improvements are discovered.

| description =The Muskrat is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent that is native to North America.  They are covered with short, dense fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with a lighter underside. As the muskrat ages, it turns partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps protect them from the cold water. To aid them in swimming, they have a long tail covered with scales rather than hair, and are slightly flattened from side to side which is a shape that is unique to them. &lt;ref name=ah/&gt;

Plant materials make up 95% of their diet, and they also eat small animals such as freshwater mussels, frogs, crayfish, fish, and small turtles. &lt;ref name=yh&gt;

| activity =Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. Muskrats follow trails they make in swamps and ponds, and when the water freezes, they continue to follow their trails under ice. They normally live in groups consisting of a male and female and their young. In the spring, they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates. 
| reproduction =During the spring, muskrats often fight with each other over territory and potential mates. Many are injured or killed in these fights. Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. They are prolific breeders, where the females can have two to three litters a year of six to eight young each. Babies are born small and hairless, and weigh only about 22 grams. Young muskrats mature between 6 months to a year. The gestation period for muskrats is 22-30 days. &lt;ref name=ah/&gt; 
| lifespan =The lifespan for a muskrat is 2-3 years old.  &lt;ref&gt;

| notes =The muskrats are sometimes referred to as “rats” in a general sense because they are medium-sized rodents with an adaptable lifestyle and omnivorous diet, but they are not, however, “true rats” because they do not belong in the genus Rattus. 
American Indians have long considered the muskrat to be a very important animal. Some predict winter snowfall levels by observing the size and timing of muskrat lodge construction. Contrary to belief, though, the thickness of muskrat lodges does not indicate the severity of the coming winter. 
The muskrat’s underfur traps air, and prevents the skin of the muskrat from becoming wet while it is in the water. Musk glands are predominant beneath the skin on the lower abdomen of male muskrats. These two glands become swollen during the spring and produce a yellowish, musky smelling fluid. Thus, the name “muskrat”. 
With their webbed feet, muskrats can also swim at a speed up to 3 miles per hour and can even swim backwards.  &lt;ref name=eh&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the beaver, the muskrat does not store food for the winter. It needs to eat fresh plants each day, and sometimes it makes channels in the mud to get from its house to reach food under the ice. To stay warm in winter, groups of muskrats huddle together in their lodges.Muskrats have the ability to hold their breath underwater for a 12-17 minutes while searching for food. When food is scarce, female muskrats have been known to eat their young. &lt;ref&gt;

The purpose of this section is to ensure new RTEMS developers know the existence, intent, and how to use existing RTEMS applications and addons available to the RTEMS community.

The website is http://git.rtems.org/ .
== Examples v2 ==
stub.

=== Hello World ===

The hello world example is designed to familiarize the user with using both the classic RTEMS interface, as well as the POSIX interface.

== RTEMS Addon Packages ==

Notes to author: Very little user interaction required. Porting your own custom libraries is another section.  

Main purpose of this pass is to keep the warm/fuzzy feeling, while adding some fluency. Secondarily, show new users that there are addon packages to RTEMS.  

Explain dependencies in a general way.

Discuss building and demo-ing the example tests.

Reference last part of: http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMS_Add-On_Packages

== Multi IO ==
Gets a user started on the RTEMS shell quickly.  Definitely hardware oriented.  The first reference would be a good introduction to something slightly more complicated than Examples v2, while the second reference could be used to look at how to get networking to interact with the shell.

http://rtemsramblings.blogspot.com/2011_02_01_archive.html

http://rtemsramblings.blogspot.com/2011/09/rtems-pair-programming.html

== RTEMS Testing ==
Cover the simpler parts of this:

rtems-test-template: needed for illustrating how to make testsuites for rtems libraries.

qemu-support: needed for networking

sim-scripts: should be mentioned in last chapter so users of hardware not in Qemu can test code.

simple-build-script: cover this in last chapter to get users up-and-running quickly.

== rtems-libbsd ==

This looks like a way to ease users into networking, and should be covered prior to (or in conjunction with) network-demos.

Cover the tests.  Include output.

== Network Demos ==
Discuss why the network demos.

Explain how to get TCP applications running on Qemu.
http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/QEMU

Extend the examples by showing how to get the desired output.

Extend the examples by showing bit-rates/performance/stress testing.

Extend the examples by having the application transmit information related to settings and statistics.

== OS Web Monitoring ==
This might be one of the ways to extend the network-demos.

== RTEMS Graphics Toolkit ==
If easy to explain walk the reader through building Micro-Windows and running on Qemu.

http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMSGraphicsToolkit

As the knowledge from the RTEMS Graphics Toolkit are most likely not going to be built upon this will likely be a special topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Formality==
Many readers and writers alike feel that the process of writing on the Web is both a blessing and a curse. The speed, utility, and flexibility of such writing is clearly a benefit.  Yet, and perhaps as a result,  formal writing style, developed voice, and common literary conventions seem, at times, to be edging gradually towards extinction.  The point is that we, as communicators, should still make use of consideration, forethought, reflection and careful editing. This increases the likelihood that we are not misunderstood, disregarded, ridiculed or neglected.

The following entries will attempt to provide some tips to consider when composing a piece of writing that will be presented or transmitted on the Internet.  

===Establishing and Using Personality===

Writing for the web generally allows more freedom to let your personality shine through than writing for print publications. Because oftentimes readers are allowed to comment or give immediate feedback, a sense of intimacy is created between writer and reader that allows for a casual, personal tone – your readers become your online friends. This has its positives and negatives. One positive is that you end up with a more creative, relaxed piece of prose.  A negative is that it is easier to become lax on mechanics and the level of formality still necessary in effective writing. 

Because of the abundance of online writing, it becomes necessary to create a unique personality. Readers are only a click away from disregarding your online writing if they find it stale or difficult to read. 

Remember that because your audience on the web is so large, it is easier to find readers who will care about what you have to say. Don't be afraid to be bold and let your personality shine through – your audience will come to you if you have something interesting to say.

===Engaging in Online Conversation===

There are a number of ways to engage in online conversation.  For instance, there are mailing lists, discussion boards, forums, blogs, chat rooms and instant messaging.  There are differences and rules when writing for each venue because each one serves its own purpose.  

Mailing lists often allow users to keep contact with one another through emails.  Individual users can use mailing lists for both their personal and professional life to keep updated on industry events, job listings, blog subscriptions, particular interests such as recipes, hobbies, fashion, etc.  You can often subscribe to mailing lists on individual/professional websites. 

Discussion boards are great for keeping up with current events, engaging in a dialogue about popular topics, solving technical problems and meeting new people.  There are hundreds of thousands of discussion boards on the web and they can be found anywhere from a personal to a professional website.  Once you find a discussion board, review its popularity.  You know it's popular if the same users are returning to comment on what others have said about them.  

Chat and instant messaging allow for immediate online communication with one or many users.  Chat allows users to enter certain domains (depending on their interests) and then begin conversations with a number of users simultaneously.  If a user then decides that he/she enjoys talking to one person from this chat room, they then may decide to engage in an instant message conversation, which is a one on one conversation either with someone you do or do not know.

Although these are only three types of online discussion, there are others depending on what sites you visit.  Also, remember if you wish to engage in online conversation, there are rules of online etiquette that need to be followed.  The sections below offer advice on other various parts of writing for the web.

===Use of Active Voice===

Web documents, unless intended otherwise should remain in the active voice. Please refer to the Active vs. Passive voice section of this Wikibook below for more in depth explanation.

*[[Rhetoric and Composition/Active and Passive Voice]]

===Responses and Flaming===

Flaming is responding to someone online in an aggressive, insulting manner. It is the equivalent of a verbal lashing and often happens in chats or discussion boards. It seems easier to participate in this kind of behavior online because there is freedom to openly express opinions with little supervision,  repercussions often aren't immediate, and the dispute is not face-to-face. Although the instinct to participate in flaming may take over when provoked by the diverse opinions brought about by the nature of online conversation, it is in poor taste and will destroy your credibility. Flaming is also a poor argument tool; it would be better to refrain and stick to facts or well-planned logical responses.

      <comment>/* Readability */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Formatting==
The readability, visual appeal and overall appearance of a page are all important. The less professional and more haphazard a document, article, or web page seems to be, the greater the likelihood that readers will call into question the ability and authority of the writer. Documents on the web should also  in some way recognize the nature of the Internet itself. As Marshall McLuhan observed, &quot;The Media is the Message.&quot;  Given the ever increasing body of knowledge that one can access on the Web, readers should be able to scan Web documents, so as to quickly pull out the information that is most interesting or vital to them, thereby allowing them to avoid or ignore material that is not.  

===Readability===

Brevity is best. Enough said.

Many documents are organized in a structure in which the most vital information comes first, followed by ever increasing detail as the argument progresses. This is referred to as a &quot;pyramid structure&quot;.  However, this format may also be inverted, in which specific details come first, and then the larger perspective follows. When considering the layout of any document on the Web, a writer should consider this.

Many readers of documents enjoy bulleted lists. 

They have benefits. Bulleted lists are:
*Easy and quick to read
*Concise
*Key Points
*People like dots

However, bulleted lists can also have drawbacks:
*Many readers won't enjoy the content of your list if such points are too long and drawn out, particularly if you go on and on about nothing of importance and basically defeat the point of having a list in the first place ...
*If there are too many items on any list, readers may become overwhelmed
*Repetition
*Lists can become tiresome
*A list may not be the right format for your message

===Hierarchies of Thought===

When constructing a Web document, you should consider the hierarchies of thought which you will be constructing. Ideas should be grouped in some sort of hierarchy, and not randomly (unless of course that is your expressed intent). Headings and subheading should be clear and easily understandable to your readers so that they can easily understand how the various ideas relate to each other in terms of order and importance. Having page that serves as a menu, table of contents or an index (such as the one at the top of this page) is generally a good idea. Headings and subheadings should be ranked in terms of size and placement on the page in a way that also allows the reader to skim and scan for the information they require. 

In regards to linkages, the amount and placement of links should be functional. Too many links can make a document appear cluttered, or it may be that in an attempt to copy or highlight a chunk of text, the reader inadvertently activates a link which they did not intend to. This is annoying in the extreme. Also, links should direct users to sites which you will find useful, not simply just those that you like personally. The definitions of obscure terms can be linked, such as in Wikipedia, however, excesses of this can be distracting and break up the overall flow of the text.

===Visual Appeal===
*It should be noted here, that as of yet, this page is lacking visual appeal, and we are aware of this... it is a work in progress. Thank you.

'''Font Usage'''

Fonts should be selected such that they are readable and that they suit your message.

Fonts which are exceedingly complex or detailed should usually be avoided, as should fonts that most users don't have in their library.

&lt;big&gt;Although most browsers allow users to alter the size, bigger is often better...&lt;/big&gt;

'''Color Usage'''

The goal in the use of color is to express artistic style, intent and contrast. 

For more information on color usage and design, check out the information at this link: [[Color Theory]]

'''Avoiding Clutter'''

Clutter should be avoided at all times. If a page is to jumbled or busy, readers may disregard it entirely. 

Pointless and flashing animation (such as those seen in many Web advertisements) is particularly distracting. 

Less is more.

===Conventions Unique to the Web (Abbreviations, Leet, Smilies)===

Every medium has developed conventions that make it easier for the reader to find things. Most web conventions have been borrowed from the print media. Once a new icon or format has been introduce on the web, if it works it quickly becomes an accepted convention. For example, the shopping cart icon is a recently developed convention that has become so familiar that designers no longer need to label it “shopping cart” &lt;ref&gt; Krug, Steve. Don’t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability. 2nd ed. Berkely: New Riders Publishing, 2006. Print. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;.

Web conventions include placement and visual presentation of navigation bars, navigation buttons, search bars, and logos. The main benefit of web conventions is that they help users find things quickly as they move from one site to another. This is because all sites use the same conventions just as all newspapers use headlines, picture captions, etc. &lt;ref&gt;Krug, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Unfortunately, designers often try to avoid using conventions, because they think they should be (or want to be) more creative. But since conventions work and help users navigate the web easily, you should probably use them unless the value of not using them clearly outweighs the cost. That is, either (1) what you replace the convention with is so clear and self-explanatory that it is as good as the convention, or (2) your innovation is so valuable that it is worth making the user learn it &lt;ref&gt;Krug 36&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also important to place conventions where they are customarily placed. To do otherwise would confuse and frustrate the user, the opposite of what a good designer wants to do &lt;ref&gt;Krug 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Utility==
While surfing the Internet, and it may not be readily apparent, but the best information is that which is useful and serves a purpose. The purposes of various web documents range over the broad spectrum of human communication. These texts might be trying to amuse, to sell something, to establish a dialogue, to inform or educate, to make some sort of artistic statement, or any number of other goals. Those sites and documents which lack utility therefore are less visited, less supported, and as a result less linked and more frequently disconnected. 

Information which is not useful will most often have decreasing sense of purpose, and as a result readers and content will become lost. A useful Internet page or document is one which not only persists, but is also regularly updated and contains recent or new material. Good sites and documents will also utilize archiving systems to record data and design, and also to track the changes made to that data over time. Organizing, cataloguing, archiving and disseminating useful information allow readers/users to find a text later, and also to see the connections within and between sources.  In addition, web content has been deemed as intellectual property, so there are also issues of permission to use information and possible copyright infringement which must be considered.  

===Purpose, Relevance and Exigency===
===Use of Archives===
===Copyright===

Copyright law is about protecting intellectual property. Only the words are protected, however, not the ideas. The author of an original work automatically has the copyright to that work the moment it is “fixed in a tangible medium” &lt;ref&gt; Kilian, Crawford. Writing for the Web: Writer’s Edition. North Vancouver: Self-Counsel Press, 2001. Print. P. 119&lt;/ref&gt;. You don’t have to register it. This is true in the United States, Canada, and other countries that are part of the Berne Convention &lt;ref&gt; Hoffman, Gretchen. Copyright in Cyberspace: Questions and Answers for Librarians. New York: Neal-Schumann Publishers, Inc., 2001. Print. p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;. Even though you don’t have to register a copyright, there are several benefits to registering it. The work must be registered in order to file a claim of infringement. If the work is registered within five years of publication, that establishes prima facie evidence of the copyright’s validity. This means an infringer has to prove your copyright’s lack of validity; you don’t have to prove that it is valid &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;. Registering a copyright is easy and relatively inexpensive. Forms and instructions are available on the copyright office website: http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;.

Web writing can be copyrighted, but it’s a complex and rapidly changing area of law. For example, if you sell an article to a print publisher, they acquire the electronic rights to it in perpetuity. There seems to be disagreement among students of copyright law as to how much protection is necessary. Killian on the one hand, says that on the Internet, copying is easy and copyright enforcement is difficult &lt;ref&gt;Killian, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, Litman warns that the entertainment and information industries continue to lobby congress for “draconian” controls of copyrighted material &lt;ref&gt; Litman, Jessica. Digital Copyright. Amherst: Prometheus Books, 2006. Print. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;. Kilian also warns that you need to be careful not to violate someone else’s copyright. If you’re pasting someone else’s web published document into your own, it’s best to get written permission from the copyright holders (even for a graphic) &lt;ref&gt;Kilian, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Kilian &lt;ref&gt;Kilian, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; offers a list of helpful sites about copyright:

Especially in the digital world, many people may not know that works may be copyrighted. To try to prevent “ignorant infringement,” Hoffman suggests placing a copyright notice on every page. Use any of these options:

* © Your name, date
* Copyright Your Name, Date
* Copr. Your Name, Date &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;.

You can also put your personal mark on every page, which shoes up as a watermark if someone tries to download, print, or copy the page &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;. You can get software for this purpose &lt;ref&gt; Bonime, Andrew, Pohlmann, Ken C. Writing for New Media. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1998. Print. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Establishing Connections==

All good public web documents should be well connected and accessible to readers. All good private web documents should be safely and securely delivered (and probably encrypted). However, regardless of what type of document you might be working on, it has the ability to go a great many places, and be read by an even greater number of people.  And so, regardless if you want your document to be public or not, you should consider who it is you will be writing for and ''also'' who might conceivably find or stumble across your work. 

You should also realize that in the act of writing on the Web that you are, in a sense, creating a virtual representation of yourself as a writer.  Your readers may not know you in person, but they will begin to know what you feel, how you think. They will form an opinion of you and your writing over time... and that can either be a positive or a negative one.  You are building a reputation of your own design and need to establish the sorts of reputations and connections that are both interesting and useful for you.  

===Maintaining a Website===

Creating a website is only half the battle, you also have to maintain and update it regularly if you want to keep your visitors. If your site is current and has new information, people are more likely to visit it. Not updating your site is a good way to lose them. 

Maintaining your site means that, among other things specific to your site, all your features work, all your images load, and all your links connect users to the proper place. Any changes you make could affect your site in different places, so if you do make a change, double check that everything else is still functional. 

Another very important aspect of maintaining you site is updating your content. This may be as simple as changing or adding links. You could also add new information or features. But, this doesn't always mean getting rid of the old. 

Remember, the simpler you keep your site, the easier it will be to maintain. Creating complicated gimmicks will only mean more maintenance and more work for you. 

An easy and user-friendly way to maintain your site is to allow user feedback. If something is not working, they will be the first to let you know. Take this feedback seriously, and, if possible, try to respond and thank the user. Evaluate the suggestion and, if you decide to implement it, contact the person who suggested it and recommend they return to see the change. A “What's New” section may be helpful to let other users know what has been updated. 

Put in a plan of action for updating and maintaining your site.
For example:
*First, decide how much time you want to spend on maintenance per month and schedule a routine time to do it so that you won't forget. For a small site, you should dedicate at least two to five hours a month on maintenance.
*Next, discover what your users are doing and saying. What kind of feedback are they leaving? What areas of your site are they most visiting? Do certain parts of your site that used to have a lot of activity seeing less activity? If your site is hosted by a web hosting site, it should provide this information for you.
*Make the changes.
*As with everything, proofread and spell-check before you upload your changes.
*Think about future enhancements like guest-books, graphics, a search engine, etc. Maybe set up a poll to see what your visitors would like added and then make sure to consider their feedback.

===Writing to be Found and Linked===
===Establishing a Virtual Reputation or Persona===

Establishing a web persona or virtual reputation can be beneficial to both your professional and social life.  It allows old friends and colleagues to contact you and see what you have been up to throughout the years. It also allows potential employers and/or clients to get a sense of your personality, accomplishments, etc. before deciding to work with you.  It is probably not a good thing, career-wise, if you are not on the web; however, the same may be true if your name gets too many hits.  Although you want to have a web identity, you do not want to have a mistaken one.  
 

It is fairly simple to establish a web identity.  First, you need to have an email account.  Make sure that this account is separate from either your work or school address.  This is in case you graduate, leave your job or other unforeseen circumstances (such as technological problems) arise.  

There are several different email archives to choose from.  Some of the best known and popular archives are Gmail, Yahoo Mail and Hotmail.  When you sign up for any of these archives, remember to choose a name for your account that is appropriate.  Although your friends may find a name like ‘Big_Daddy’ or ‘Foxy_Lady’ humorous and/or suitable for you, potential employers and clients will not.  If you are having trouble with finding a name you like, the email service will often give you suggestions based on your information (like your name, year you were born, etc.) when you sign up for the service. 

Once you have signed up for your email service, the second thing you need to do is check to see if your name is taken as a domain.  You could simply type ‘yourfullname.com’ into the browser or search engine to see if anything pops up, or you could visit the site [http://www.betterwhois.com/ BetterWhoIs.com] and then register.  Although it's possible to have another suffix such as -.net, -.org, etc., these may be more expensive and more difficult for users to remember.  

Now that you have an email account and domain name, it is time to establish yourself on the web.  An easy way to do this is through blogs.  Blogs are immensely popular because they are constantly evolving and are voyeuristic by nature.  You can use sites such as [https://www.blogger.com/start Blogger], [http://www.livejournal.com/ LiveJournal] and [http://wordpress.com/ WordPress] to begin your blog and then export those to your website.  

When you sign-up for your blog, you'll need to have a username, an avatar (a picture of you or one you find suitable) and to pick a theme for your blog.  Once you have done this you can moderate who comments on or views your blog and/or allow other users to subscribe to your blog.   

Now you have an established web persona.  Just remember, that this persona or identity needs to be updated on a regular basis to remain interesting and correct.  Even if you only blog a couple times a week, this should be enough to keep your domain current.  Also, if you would like to use this web persona simply as a professional site, there are other ways to keep in contact with old friends and colleagues.  You can do this through various social networking sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Advice for Writing in Various Venues on the Web==

===Blogs===

Ideally a blog is an informal and low stakes online writing venue where you are able to make your opinion known or workshop ideas. For some, the freedom of a blog can be paralyzing. Especially if you think too much about your audience—who they are, and how they will react to what you write. The following are some tips for writing a blog: 

Remember that people like blogs. We are generally voyeuristic by nature and like to see the thought process at work. People also like that blogs are written by a real person with a unique personality. Don't worry about your audience and making your blog perfect, instead write the blog for yourself and concentrate on expressing your opinion and ideas the way only you can.  

Make your blog even more interesting by linking to pages that support your opinion or that you simply find amusing and would like to share.

Like a title on a paper, the headline for your blog should be interesting and creative. You could use a funny comment, a non sequitur, a quote or any other text that stands out and creates interest. Also like a paper title, make sure your headline at least hints at what your blog will be about. 

Once a reader finds a blog they like, they are usual loyal and like to return to see what new things the blogger has to say. Often this has a lot to do with the style of the writer, so once you find a style you like to blog in, try to stick to it. 

Don't forget that with all writing, editing is key. Don't forget to edit your blog. Re-read your post and check for errors.

===Chats===

While initiating conversation in an online chatroom, the main goals are to be polite, interested/-ing, safe and aware of the parameters of the particular chatroom. While chats may seem very free and public spaces, most are privately owned, and may be logged, moderated and or monitored by site administrators, law enforcement officials, criminals and other entities. 

'''Good things to do while in a chatroom:'''

*Protect yourself and your identity: Create a good pseudonym or screen name for yourself. It should be short and easy to type. However, do not divulge any personal information, in doing so you will protect yourself from sexual predators, identity thieves and other potential criminals. Use discretion at all times.

*Respect others. Treat others as least as well (if not better) than you want to be treated. While some chatters might engage in insulting, derogatory, rude, or disruptive behavior, you should refrain from replying with such. The better move is to ignore them completely or find another (and more moderated) place to chat. Many chatrooms feature software which allows you to block incoming messages from certain parties, and you may choose to use this to limit or end your interaction with hostile persons.

*Be kind to newcomers. New or naive readers may be unaware or inconsiderate of the established norms within a chat or online community. Be patient, kind and try to help these newcomers understand the parameters of the virtual space.

*If you have just connected to a chat, be sure to know what the topic of discussion is before you dive in. Read, wait and listen and give others a chance to talk. Also, either a general &quot;hello&quot; message to the group, or a specific greeting or questions to a specific person who you have had previous and positive contact with is usually a good way to start.

'''Bad practices to avoid while in a chatroom:'''

*Do NOT TYPE IN ALL CAPITALS or '''Bold face''' letters. Such behavior is equivalent to yelling. It may attract people's attention, but more than likely you will be ignored, reprimanded or booted from the chat.

*Avoid asking intrusive questions of other people, particularly those regarding personal information, for the same reason as those listed above. You may well be curious about the particulars of a person's life, realize that privacy is there right, and they have no duty to divulge any such information to you. Also, should they do so, realize that this information may be fabricated and/or false.

*Avoid caustic, obscene and sexually implicit language.

*If you are typing longer messages, break them down into shorter, more readable chunks, or alternately, take your conversation into email correspondence with more lengthy content and dialogue.

===Discussion Boards===
Discussion boards are an online forum for conversation. Usually they are organized in threads by date, subject, or both. Discussion boards are typically formed around a single specific topic (for example: current events, computer games, even book covers have their own discussion boards), but multiple conversations regarding that topic can and should develop.  Because users of the discussion board return often to follow-up on their posts,  a virtual community develops. 

On an online discussion board your goal is to stimulate others to join your conversation. The trick is to encourage active and meaningful debate. Steer clear of “yes” or “no” questions, instead ask open-ended questions that will spark further threads of the discussion. Tell an personal anecdote relevant to the discussion and try to get others to do so as well.  Try not to get too far off-topic and if you find that others are not progressing the debate in any meaningful way, steer the  conversation back to the original subject. Keep the conversation interesting and moving. 

Make sure that if you are responding to a question on the discussion board you include specific information. Saying, “I don't know” is not very helpful. At the very least give an idea of where the information they are looking for may be found. 

Try to be concise. Readers want to know your point and don't want to sit through a boring and unnecessary display of your expertise on the topic of debate. Attribute all your sources. Finally, don't forget to spell-check, words spelt incorrectly hurt your credibility. 

Make sure that when you join a discussion board you read and follow their rules of conduct. 

The following are some common things to remember when posting on discussion boards: 

* Even though lively discussion and debate is encouraged, attacking an individual is not. Do not personally attack others. Messages that are profane, racist, demeaning, threatening, about illegal topics, or generally offensive (you may have to use your common sense about what you think is “offensive” considering the topic of discussion and the other members participating in the conversation) are usually prohibited and can be erased by the discussion leader. If you don't want it said to or about you, don't say it to or about others. Members who post those type of messages will often be kicked out of the discussion.

* Keep your posts consistent with the theme of the topic and the purpose of the thread of discussion.

* Most discussion boards require that you use your name or handle when posting. It is responsible to attach a name to what you are saying.  If you don't want to put your name behind something you post, reconsider whether or not it is something you really want to say or something that really needs to be said to move the discussion along. In some discussion boards anonymous posts will be deleted by the discussion leader. Also, make sure your username is not offensive or meant to intimidate others.

* Do not use discussion board to advance your personal agenda. For example, don't advertise or promote surveys, contest or chain letters in a discussion board.

* When quoting information from others give the source and a link when possible. If you do link to another site, make sure it is relevant to the discussion.

* Don't post the same thing more than once. This is “spamming” and is usually not allowed.

===Emails===

Email is short for electronic mail.  They are a form of rapid communication used in both business and in everyday life.  There are four main parts when formatting your email messages: guide words, salutation, body and closing lines.  The order of these formats vary depending on your email provider. 

'''Guide Words''' The guide words include: ''To,''''From,''''Subject,''''Cc,''''Bcc,''and ''Attached.''
* '''''To:''''' The recipient's email addresss is included here.  If the receiver's name is included enclose address in angle brackets.
*'''''From:''''' Your name and address should be written on this line, if the program does not insert for you automatically.
*'''''Subject:''''' The subject line gives the receiver a clear description of your message.
** The subject line should summarize the central idea of your email as well as provide quick identification.  It is usually written in abbreviated style, omitting articles (a, an, the), and does not need to be a complete sentence.  Good subject lines are often attention-getting and are often written in verb form.
*** '''Effective Subject Lines'''
**** Three Promotional Items to Showcase at Our Next Trade Show
**** Beefing Up Our Messaging Capabilities
**** Staff Meeting to Discuss Summer Vacation Schedules
*** '''Ineffective Subject Lines'''
**** Trade Show
**** New Software
**** Meeting
*'''''Cc (Carbon or courtesy copy):''''' Any other receiver's address should be written on this line.
*'''''Bcc (Blind carbon copy):''''' This line sends a copy of the message to another recipient without the addressee's knowledge.
*'''''Attached:''''' Attachments are optional and can include everything from business reports to papers to photographs.  If using an attachment, be sure to clarify its purpose in the body of the email.

'''Salutation.''' Unlike a memo, it is often necessary to include a salutation in an email.  This is because emails are more like letters than memos.  Therefore, a salutation, such as ''Dear Beth,''''Hi Beth,''''Greetings,'' or just ''Beth,'' is appropriate.

'''Body.''' The body of an email should be typed in both with uppercase and lowercase characters and never restricted to one or the other.  In addition, you should never use bold or italics when writing an email.  They may create a string of control characters that may cause chaos in the recipient's computer.  Also, the body/subject of the email should be kept to one topic with the total message being under three screens in length.  To assist you, many email programs include basic editing features, such as cut, paste, word wrap and copy.

'''Closing Lines.''' If you are writing from within an organization, closing lines and/or names may be omitted.  This is because the recipient should recognize them from identification in the opening lines.  However, for outside messages, writers may include lines such as ''Sincerely'' or ''All the best'' along with their names and email address.  If the recipient is unlikely to know you, it's wise to include your title and organization at the end of the message.

'''EXAMPLE EMAIL'''

'''To:''' Hugh Beerman &lt;hbeerman@hotmail.com&gt;

'''From:''' Arnold Enuff &lt;arnoldenuff_21@gmail.com&gt;

'''Cc:'''

'''Bcc:'''

'''Subject:''' Business Internship for Summer 2007

'''Attachment(s):'''

Dear Mr. Beerman:

I would like to inquire about the business internship being offered by your company this upcoming summer.  The company's website gives some very general information regarding the position; however, I would like to know more about some of the specifics.

*Do you need to have any specialized training in order to apply for the position?

*Would an internship this summer give me an advantage with possibly joining your company in the future?

*What would be the general hours of the position?

*Is this a paid or unpaid internship?

If you could get back to me with this or any other pertinent information, I would be extremely grateful.  Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Arnold Enuff

===Games and Simulations===

Games such as World of Warcraft, Warhammer Online, and other massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPG) have their own terminology spoken by players in game. In these games players make use of abbreviations and acronyms in order to communicate more efficiently. Quick communication can mean the difference between success and failure.

Generally, conversation in these games is casual, but there are a few rules. Never type in all capital letters, this is seen as bad form by players of the game. Also, avoid swearing. Most of these games have built in filters, but many players do not use them and some are offended by strong language.

There are literally hundreds of acronyms, slang terms, and abbreviations in online games so be patient; it will take some time to learn them. Always remember it is just a game and the main goal is to have fun.

===Podcasts===
Podcasts are electronic audio or video files that are available for download from many internet sites. The files can be played back on computers or portable media players. 

Originally podcasts were intended to be used as a type of personal radio program. However, today podcasts can contain television programs, class lectures, meetings, or almost anything that can be voice or video recorded. The main advantage of podcasting is that it allows access to information whenever it is convenient to the listener.
 
The audience for podcasts can vary greatly depending on the purpose, so it is vital that you are aware of exactly who your audience is and how they expect you to use language. Colloquial language may be appropriate for some podcast but not others. For instance, a podcast from a morning radio show may be very informal, but a podcast intending to train people to use a computer program would be more formal.
Generally podcasts are read from a script. So, the revising and editing are vital to produce a high quality product. Also, it is a good idea to rehearse the script in advance in order to minimize mistakes in the recording process.

===Social Networking Sites (Myspace, Facebook, etc.)===

Sites such as MySpace, Facebook, Bebo, Multiply and others allow personal users to keep in touch with old friends as well as meet new ones.  However, these sites are also sometimes used as a place to start job networking, for locating and advertising for roommates/apartments/etc. and for meeting potential significant others.  These sites often allow users to create a space that is unique to their own personality, letting them share their thoughts, photos, interests, activities, favorite movies, books, television shows and music.  Also, in many sites, users have the option to join groups that pertain to their particular interests and to meet other users who share those interests.

Although social networks allow users to put their address and phone numbers online, it is ill advised.  Placing sensitive information online only makes it easier for hackers and others to steal personal information and for online predators to secure a new target.  Also, try to refrain from posting information and/or photographs that could be detrimental to your professional life.  Recruiters and employers are now often checking social networking sites to size up potential employees and/or clients.

If you would like to include certain photographs or certain information that could be used against you, you do have options. Many of these sites allow you to choose your own privacy setting to secure your personal information.  There is an open door setting, which allows anyone and everyone to see your site, a &quot;friends only&quot; setting, which obviously only allows your friends to access your information and other settings as well.  Also, some of these sites let users block other individuals from adding you as a friend.  Instead users may have to know your last name, enter in a password or know your email address in order to add you.  That said, if you have a limited profile, even if the other user does know your information, you are often asked to confirm your relationship with that person before they can access all of your information.    

The following are descriptions and links to four popular social networks in the United States and around the world.       

'''''MySpace -''''' The MySpace headquarters is located in Beverly Hills, CA, and run by Fox Interactive Media whose headquarters run out of New York City.  MySpace allows users to share blogs, bulletins, photos, groups, music and videos in various networks.  It also lets users choose their own background, layouts and play music and videos on their individual profiles.  Anyone can join MySpace and it is free to use.  For more information or to join please visit the MySpace website: [http://www.myspace.com/ MySpace].

'''''Facebook –''''' Facebook first appeared in 2004.  Created by former Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, the site, “the facebook,” as it was originally called, was started as a social project before it exploded into the popular network it is today.  Originally Facebook only allowed college students to join; however, due to the rise in popularity, individual users are now allowed to join networks relating to their high school, college, occupation and/or town or city they live or have formerly lived in.  Facebook is like MySpace in that it allows users to write notes (blog), share photos, give electronic gifts, join groups and various networks as well as utilize several other applications to connect with friends and personalize their space.  These applications include, but are not limited to:  movie trivia, 10-second interviews, quotes from comedians and popular television shows, rock-papers-scissors and sports team applications.  For more information or to join this network, please visit the Facebook website: [http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook].

'''''Bebo –''''' Bebo is a social network run out of San Francisco, CA, by Bebo Incorporated.  The site lets users connect with old friends and make new ones.  Users are allowed to share photos, interests or, as it says on their website, “just hang out.”  Bebo allows users to chat with one another while they are online as well as answer polls, quizzes and respond to blogs.  For more information on Bebo or to join this network, please visit the Bebo website: [http://www.bebo.com/ Bebo] 

'''''Multiply –''''' Although Multiply is much like the other social networking sites in that it allows users to share blogs, photos, etc., what it prides itself on is continual updating of information.  Anytime a user changes a blog, adds photos or information to their individual site, all of the users in that person's network is notified.  In turn, Multiply also provides a thread to allow users to provide feedback on the newly posted information.  In addition, one feature that is different from other sites is that Multiply provides a space to share movie and restaurant reviews with other users as well as schedule social and business events on a calendar.  For more information or to join this network, please visit the Multiply website: [http://www.multiply.com/ Multiply]

Aside from the social network sites that allow users to share all sorts of information (blogs, pictures, videos and personal information), there are sites that simply allow users to network through blogs and picture and video sharing.  These sites give the user more anonymity.  You may just have an avatar (user picture) and username opposed to sharing your real name, pictures, interests, etc.  Some of these sites include: [http://www.livejournal.com/ LiveJournal],[https://www.blogger.com/start Blogger], [http://www.youtube.com/ You Tube], [http://www.flickr.com/ Flickr], [http://www.dropshots.com/ Drop Shots] and [http://www.metatube.net/ MetaTube].

Hi.  Instead of saying that answering the door should be done differently, could you elaborate?  ''How'' should it be done differently than described? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 02:38, 15 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This species is missing the notes section of the wikibook page. Also, the references should not be after the reference cue, they should be within the text after each text the references support. Many of the sentences are incomplete sentences and would be more easily read if they had a clear subject and verb. As noted in red, the size measurements should have imperial form(inches feet etc) first with the metric form (mm, cm etc) in parentheses after.

In the range section this portion is not necessary for the wikibook:
giving them the widest distribution of mice in the subfamily Zapodinae.


In the activity section, you just need information about how active this species is and when. Information such as when/if they hibernate and if they are nocturnal or diurnal etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The notes section is missing in the wikipage. Also, there needs to be citations after each point. 
In the size section, the metrics should follow the imperial measurements in parentheses.

The activity section is not in complete sentences. I would reword to make it complete sentences so it makes more sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">='''World Glass Golf Application'''=

==''World Glass Sports''==

This is a sporting company that specializes in providing easy-to-use applications for a variety of different sports and activities. By utilizing the Google Glasses technology, we will enable our customers to have a personal trainer, caddy, coach, motivator, and more whenever they are needed! The first impression we make on the market will be with the release of our “World Glass Golf” application

==''[http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/index.html World Glass Golf]''==

Our new and innovative golfing application will be “one of a kind” and will make a splash within the golfing community by highlighting the strengths of current technology and products, in addition to adding our very own tools and tactics. The application will be provided to consumers through Google Glasses technology. The main elements of the application are: Player Profile, Golfing Social, Measure My Clubs, Course Finder, Range Mode, and Settings.

==='''Player Profile'''===

This part of the application will serve as the golfer’s notebook. This will be a place where you will be able to find the golfer’s current handicap, past scores, high scores, ID picture, shot recordings, and career golfing highlights. The profile will be viewable to other World Glass Golf users within the Golfing Social part of the application. Essentially, the player profile will serve the same way that a Facebook profile does, except it will be mainly golfing associated. Friends will be able to see the profile and see what your most recent scores were and where you plan on playing next.

==='''Golfing Social'''===

The social media aspect of the application will be what keeps people engaged within the golfing community. The sport is already a very social atmosphere. It is commonly used as a relaxing get away on a day off, a place to take potential clients, and a place for families to come together. Golfing Social will primarily connect golfers within similar communities, keep everybody connected within the sport, and bring golfers with similar talents together for a round. It is quite common for somebody to go out and play a round alone or be paired up with another twosome. Instead of waiting to be paired up with a random group, why not at least have the opportunity to play with somebody who has a similar skill level or similar interests? Golfing Social will ensure that people are having an even better interaction amongst each other, and it will make it easier for golfers from all walks of life to connect.

==='''Measure My Clubs'''===

This part of the application will be used and completed before the round of golf begins. It is designed to serve as your caddy throughout each round. However, the time needs to be taken at the driving range to find all the lengths of all your clubs. The golfer will start with their driver and continue to work their way through the woods and set of irons.  For each club the player will take twenty shots. The application will measure the lengths and take an average distance for each club. As soon as the round begins, you will be able to utilize your digital caddy and assure yourself of hitting the right club for a crucial mid-round shot. 

==='''Course Finder'''===

The first use of the Course Finder will be a simple search engine that customers will be able to take advantage of. They will be able to see all golf clubs around their area along with what tee times they have available, and even how many World Glass Golf users are playing there. The application will also have player testimonials for many of different courses. The second use will be to give each course the opportunity to manage their own profile within the application. Here they can provide different promotions, events, and tournaments that they will be hosting. 

==='''Range Mode'''===

Range Mode will primarily be used as a training mechanism. What makes our training techniques different is that we make it more interactive and fun to improve your game. Through the glasses, the application will be able to project different golfing situations through the eyes of the golfer. For example, users might be able to play the Par 5 Hole 16 at Augusta as a way of training. Additionally, they will be able to take the same shot over and over until they feel ready to proceed with the next set up. Range Mode will also go hand in hand with Measure My Clubs. 

==='''Settings'''===

This part of the application is for general maintenance purposes only. There will be application updates found here, along with minor changes that can be made to help personalize the application for customers. 

='''Customer Development Plan'''=

Getting out into the market and discussing the innovative application with possible consumers is the best way of establishing a customer development plan. The customer development plan for World Glass Golf will be a four-week long process. Each week strides towards completing our goal will be taken and we will begin to gain valuable information.  By then digesting the new insights fully and making changes where appropriate, we will be in much better line for success. 

=='''Customer Development Goals'''==


This part of the application development is crucial while intending to be successful. Engaging with possible consumers can tell you a lot about your product.  The feedback given will highlight some of the positive areas of the application and will also expose some of the weaker areas. In addition, there will be some aspects that need to be added in order to be sure the application is well rounded. Before setting out into the market there were a number of goals set that will be used as guidelines and benchmarks while gaining first hand information. The goals are as follows:

•	Interact in full conversation with a range of different golfers. Differences we will look for will include age, gender, skill level, and technology level. By accounting for these differences we will be able to cover our entire target market.

•	Interview anywhere from Twenty to Thirty golfers from different golf stores and different golf courses. 

•	Visit anywhere from Two to Five different golf courses. This is important so that we are engaging with different circles of golfing communities. Also, we hope to visit low cost courses and at least one high scale or private golf club. 

•	Visit One or Two pro shops that are located on the Gold Coast. Not only will this opportunity be utilized to talk to golfers in general, but we will also aim to talk to managers of the pro shop. Here our conversations will be a little bit different. Not only will we have the conversation regarding just the product, but also their opinion as far as possible rental agreements that they would be comfortable with. The point of this is to see just how much emphasis we should put on making Google Glasses available through rentals. 

•	Lastly, it is important to make at least one blog post on a golfing themed thread. Blogs are purely opinionated pieces of writing and people will not be shy to express their honest opinion regarding our product. The aim will be to make a blog post designed to orchestrate further conversation by other users.

=='''Week One'''==

The first week of our customer development phase was a good start towards achieving our goals. In total, we interviewed six golfers and visited a total of one golf course. The course that was visited was Palm Meadows Golf Club located in Robina on the Gold Coast. The golf course is mid range as far as appearance, exclusivity, and pricing goes. It ended up being a blessing in disguise due to the fact that it had a very diverse crowd of golfers. [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/customer-discovery-process.html Table One] shows the breakdown of the different golfers interviewed and their answers for the different topics of conversation. 
	The results for the table were then gathered and put into percentage totals. Some initial trends were started after the first week. The most assuring piece of information was the fact that 83.3% of the people interviewed said they would use the application, while the remaining 16.6% said maybe. Also, four out of the six interviewees said that sponsorship or representation would really help to sell the product. Lastly, out of the six people interviewed, most people were most interested in Golfing Social, Training Mode, and Caddy Mode. Each response was mention 33.3% of the time. 
	As we look towards week two, the goal is to get a larger group of interviews at a different golf course. It would also be a plus to possibly interview more female golfers. 

=='''Week Two'''==

Even larger strides were taken in Week Two of the Customer Development Phase. There were a total of thirteen different golfers interviewed, and the interviews took place over two different golf courses. The two courses visited this particular week were Palmer Gold Coast and Gold Coast Country Club. The Palmer Gold Coast, designed by the famous golfer Arnold Palmer, was a pretty upscale course. The green fees are a bit higher and just based on the availability of tee times, it must be a tough spot to get a reservation. The Gold Coast Country Club was another mid-range course that welcomes people from all walks of life within the general public. The results of the interview can be seen in [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/customer-discovery-process.html Table Two].
	Comparing and combining these results with the results from Week One, there are some major trends that have become quite visible. First off, it is evident for the second week in a row that there are fewer females on the golf course than males. However, there has been quite some interest in the Golfing Social aspect of the app. Initially we expected that females would show most interest, but it turns out that both sexes are interested in that area. Within the thirteen interviews conducted in Week Two, 76.9% of the interviewees expressed a lot of interest in the Golfing Social idea. Two other numbers that stood out were the amount of people saying they would just rent the product before purchasing it (69.2%).  [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/customer-discovery-process.html Table Two] also shows that more than two thirds of the interviewees thought some type of sponsorship was important in enhancing the reputation of the application.

=='''Week Three'''==

Week Three was our last week designated for making people to people connections. Again, this is a very important part of the customer discovery process. You can get a much more genuine response with face-to-face interactions. Although it is a short amount of time, it still enabled me to create a small but impactful relationship with each person spoken to. This week there were a total of seven golfers spoken to, one golf course visited, and one pro golf shop visited. [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/customer-discovery-process.html Table Three] shows a break down of the results that were found.
Unfortunately, there was another surplus of male interviewees and just one female interviewed. Also, there were some of the same trends showing up, as they were in Week One and Week Two. The level of technology use was high again, showing that 71.4% of the people interviewed use a high level of technology. The “I wish” hypotheticals also showed some similar topics. Golfing Social and Shot Recorder were two of the main topics that people were interested in. 57.1 % of the interviewees in Week Three were interested in Golfing Social, while a whopping 71.4% of the people also liked the idea of a Shot Recorder.
	There was also one golfing pro shop visited this week, named The House of Golf. This is a chain company, which has locations throughout Australia. This particular location was in Bundall, on the Gold Coast. There I was able to speak to a manager about some possible rental ideas. He is located on Table Three as the 32 year old Marty. He liked the overall idea of the application, but was not willing to consider the idea of renting some Google Glasses. I explained how there would be an opportunity for both parties to make money and he accepted that, but explained that it was still too early to say how interested he would be in forming a contract. Like most people talked to, it is hard to form a firm opinion when the product isn’t even out yet. 

=='''Week Four-Gathering and Categorizing Information'''==

This last week of the Customer Development Phase was designed to harness and gather all valuable information that was presented to us. We combined the results from [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/customer-discovery-process.html all three weeks] of face-to-face interviews. There was a grand total of twenty six golfers interviewed, a total of four golf courses visited, and one pro shop visited. While re-evaluating the Customer Development Goals, it is clear that we have succeeded in almost every goal we set. The one that did not get completed was a blog post. This goal ended up getting changed due to the fact that there are ways of getting our idea out there that will be more beneficial to us. We will be getting feedback by getting the website (****) out on to multiple social media platforms. By utilizing the power that Facebook and Twitter have, we will ensure a larger amount of feedback, which can be gathered as the future unfolds. 
	While looking at all of the results as a whole, there were some very positive conclusions that can be drawn. First, there was a high rate of technology usage among the twenty-six people interviewed. This is a big plus because people will not seem intimidated or overwhelmed by the technology Google is about to release. Also, we were able to see what aspects of the application or of most interest to the golfers. The main surprise there was the popular reception that Golfing Social received. People seemed to like the idea of connecting with randoms, friends, and family. Also, there has never been a first person recording of a once in a lifetime shot. Now people will be able to prove they hit that 100 foot put and relive the memorable experiences lived on golf coarse. 

='''Application of Data to make Changes'''=

This Customer Discovery Process has proven to be very effective for World Glass Golf. Although some great results have come, there will continue to be interviews made and data gathered, so we will be able to learn more and more about the wants and needs of our potential customers. With the initial Customer Discovery Process performed there were two major conclusions and adjustments that needed to made to our golfing application. The first one was the importance of the Golfing Social aspect, and the second one was how important it will be to make rentals available during the introduction phase of the product. 
Golfing Social was initially thought of as a minor compliment to the overall application. After looking at the interviews, it is clear that this will actually be a vital part of what we are offering. It is no secret just how popular Facebook is getting. There are billions and billions of user across the array of different social platforms. This social media platform, Golfing Social, will have a niche market, but could still be very successful. The application will definitely have the capability of linking to major social media websites, which will make it one of our biggest marketing tools as well. Going forward with the development of the application, we will be putting more importance on the Golfing Social aspect, and will try to gain more in depth information through future interviews.
The second, and most important, aspect that we need to further develop is the opportunity for rental agreements. The entire outcome of the application is based on the general public's adoption rate of Google Glasses. At first, people might be timid to make the transition, or it might be too expensive for a large portion of the public. If we can still have people using the application through a one day rental, we can still assure success of the application. We would be targeting golfing pro shops and golf resorts to form rental agreements. We would rent them the application and Google Glasses in exchange for a monthly rental fee and a percentage of their total rental sales. During the introduction and implementation phase this will be what makes or brakes us as an organization. Rental agreements will eventually fade away as the adoption of Google's new product raises.
While considering these two minor changes, it is important to make changes or improvements to the [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/business-model-canvas.html Business Model Canvas]. In our situation we have looked at the Key Activities portion, and made sure to note the importance of the Golfing Social portion. Also, we went to the Customer Segments and noted that Rental Agreements will be crucial to the initial success and reach of our application.
Overall, the Customer Discovery Process has been a success and has left us wanting more out of our potential clientele. We have a positive outlook on our new innovative idea and we encourage you to keep yourself updated by visiting our [http://worldglasssports.weebly.com/index.html website].</text>

      <comment>قصة قصيرة</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">                                               غير البشر
  
 في بيت مملئ العفوية و النشاط ولد توأمان أحدهما مايد و الاخر حامد كبرا واصبحا رجالاً ويعملان في منطقةٍ تبعد عن مسقط رأسهما بحوالي ٣٥٨ كيلومتر . يتصف احدهما بقوه الإيمان و دائماً ما يؤدي الفرائض في اوقاتها اما الاخر فيستمع للاغاني و يصادق رفقاء السوء .

 في يوم من الايام و كالعادة استيقظ التوأمان و استعدا للعمل ، و عند الإفطار كان بانتظارهما اشهى الطعام منه المحلى و الهريس و لا ننسى خبز الرقاق مع العسل . تناول الاخوان ما حب قلبها و شرعا لركوب السيارات . مايد : بسم الله وفي الجانب الاخر : ما هذا اليوم ما هاذا الروتين الممل عمل اكل نوم اكل نوم و الاكل هو نفسه ما هذه الحياة كل يوم نفس الموال يا حامد كن مثل اخيك صل لما انت لست مثل اخاك لم لا تدعو ربك لما لم انجبت ابناً لا يعرف دينه و ماذا يفعل في دنياه و لما لا تنفد ، استمع إلى بعض الأغاني فهاذا أفضل .
 وصل مايد إلى النقطة التي ترعبه كل يوم فهي منطقة نائية يقال انها مسكونه بالجن فاستعاذ بالله و مر إلى بر الامان . حامد على حالته من ركب السيارة على التذمر و الترديد وراء أي أغنية .
فجاءة تدهورت ضخرة امام حامد فأعاقت مسير السيارة فسار للعمل بما انه على مقربةٍ منه اخذ يسير حتى وصل إلى قمة جبل به سدرة و استظل بها فغفى .
فاق الغافي و الجبل كالسفينة في عاصف  تحيط به الرياح من كل اتجاه مشى بضع خطوات ثم قرر يكمل في الغد ويشرح للمدير ما حصل معه . احتضن حامد السدرة فرى فتاه صغيرة تبكي بدون ان تصدر صوت فاقترب حامد منها ووضع يده على كتفها وبادر بالسؤال من انت ؟ رفعت الطفلة وجهها بسكون وهي تحدق في عيني الفتى بنظة ساحرة تملؤها الطفوله و البرائة فقبلها على رأسها و احتضنها فجأة اتى رجل غاضب الملامح و امسك بيد الطفلة بصمت وانطلق دون ان يتفوه بحرف .هدأت العاصفة واكمل حامد طريقه ولكنه لاحظ ان القطط السوداء تملأ المكان و تلحقه إلى أي مكان . 
 
.. حين افرغ من الدراس سأكمل لكم القصة او بالاحرى سأكتبها ..</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The majority of traditional Chinese philosophy originates in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States eras, during a period known as the &quot;Hundred Schools of Thought&quot;, which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments. Although much of Chinese philosophy begins in the Warring States period, elements of Chinese philosophy have existed for several thousand years; some can be found in the ''Yi Jing'' (the Book of Changes), an ancient compendium of divination, which dates back to at least 672 BCE. It was during the Warring States era that the major philosophies of China, Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, and Taoism, arose, along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity, like Agriculturalism, Chinese Naturalism, and the Logicians.

Following the Qin Dynasty, Confucianism became the dominant philosophical school of China. Confucianism represents the collected teachings of the Chinese sage Confucius, who lived from 551 to 479 BCE. His philosophy concerns the fields of ethics and politics, emphasizing personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice, traditionalism, and sincerity. The Analects stress the importance of ritual, but also the importance of 'ren', which loosely translates as 'human-heartedness, Confucianism, along with Legalism, is responsible for creating the world’s first meritocracy, which holds that one's status should be determined by education and character rather than ancestry, wealth, or friendship. Confucianism was and continues to be a major influence in Chinese culture, the state of China and the surrounding areas of Southeast Asia. 

The largest philosophical rivals to Confucianism were Legalism and Mohism before the Han dynasty. Legalism as a coherent philosophy disappeared largely due to its relationship with the unpopular authoritarian rule of Qin Shi Huang, however, many of its ideas and institutions would continue to influence Chinese philosophy until the end of Imperial rule during the Xinhai Revolution. Mohism though popular at first due to its emphasis on brotherly love versus harsh Qin Legalism, fell out of favour during the Han Dynasty due to the efforts of Confucians in establishing their views as political orthodoxy. The Six Dynasties era saw the rise of the Xuanxue philosophical school and the maturation of Chinese Buddhism, which had entered China from India during the Late Han Dynasties. By the time of the Tang Dynasty five-hundred years after Buddhisms arrival into China, it had transformed into a thoroughly Chinese religious philosophy dominated by the school of Zen Buddhism. Neo-Confucianism became highly popular during the Song Dynasty and Ming Dynasty due in large part to the eventual combination of Confucian and Zen Philosophy.

==Background==

===Early beliefs===

Early Shang Dynasty thought was based upon cyclicity. This notion stems from what the people of the Shang Dynasty could observe around them: day and night cycled, the seasons progressed again and again, and even the moon waxed and waned until it waxed again. Thus, this notion, which remained relevant throughout Chinese history, reflects the order of nature. In juxtaposition, it also marks a fundamental distinction from western philosophy, in which the dominant view of time is a linear progression. During the Shang, fate could be manipulated by great deities, commonly translated as Gods. Ancestor worship was present and universally recognized. There was also human and animal sacrifice.

When the Shang were overthrown by the Zhou, a new political, religious and philosophical concept was introduced called the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;. This mandate was said to be taken when rulers became unworthy of their position and provided a shrewd justification for Zhou rule. During this period, archaeological evidence points to an increase in literacy and a partial shift away from the faith placed in Shangdi (the Supreme Being in traditional Chinese religion), with ancestor worship becoming commonplace and a more worldly orientation coming to the fore.

===Hundred Schools of Thought===

In around 500 BCE, after the Zhou state weakened and China moved into the Spring and Autumn Period, the classic period of Chinese philosophy began (it is an interesting fact that this date nearly coincides with the emergence of the first Greek philosophers). This is known as the Hundred Schools of Thought (諸子百家). This period is considered the golden age of Chinese philosophy. Of the many schools founded at this time and during the subsequent Warring States Period, the four most influential ones were Confucianism, Daoism (often spelled &quot;Taoism&quot;), Mohism and Legalism.

====Confucianism====
[[File:Konfuzius-1770.jpg|thumb|Confucius, gouache on paper, ca. 1770 (The Granger Collection, New York)]]

Confucianism is a philosophical school developed from the teachings of the sage collected in the Analects of Confucius. It is a system of moral, social, political, and religious thought that has had tremendous influence on Chinese history, thought, and culture down to the 21st century. Some Westerners have considered it to have been the &quot;state religion&quot; of imperial China. Its influence also spread to Korea and Japan.

The major Confucian concepts include rén (humanity or humaneness), zhèngmíng (rectification of names; e.g. a ruler who rules unjustly is no longer a ruler and may be dethroned), zhōng (loyalty), xiào (filial piety), and lǐ (ritual). Confucius taught both positive and negative versions of the Golden Rule. The concepts Yin and Yang represent two opposing forces that are permanently in conflict with each other, leading to perpetual contradiction and change. The Confucian idea of &quot;Rid of the two ends, take the middle&quot; is a Chinese equivalent of Hegel's idea of &quot;thesis, antithesis, and synthesis&quot;, which is a way of reconciling opposites, arriving at some middle ground combining the best of both.

====Taoism====

Taoism (Daoism) is a philosophy and later also developed into a religion based on the texts the ''Tao Te Ching'' (ascribed to Laozi) and the Zhuangzi (partly ascribed to Zhuangzi). The character Tao 道 (Dao) literally means &quot;path&quot; or &quot;way&quot;. However in Daoism it refers more often to a meta-physical term that describes a force that encompasses the entire universe but which cannot be described nor felt. All major Chinese philosophical schools have investigated the correct Way to go about a moral life, but in Taoism it takes on the most abstract meanings, leading this school to be named after it. It advocated non-action (wu wei), the strength of softness, spontaneity, and relativism. Although it serves as a rival to Confucianism, a school of active morality, this rivalry is compromised and given perspective by the idiom &quot;practise Confucianism on the outside, Taoism on the inside.&quot; Most of Taoism's focus is on what is perceived to be the undeniable fact that human attempts to make the world better actually make the world worse. Therefore it is better to strive for harmony, minimising potentially harmful interference with nature or in human affairs.

====Legalism====
[[File:Shangyang.jpg|thumbnail|left|Shang Yang, the originator of Legalist thought]]
Legalism is a pragmatic political philosophy synthesized by Shang Yang and Han Fei. With an essential principle like &quot;when the epoch changed, the ways changed&quot;, it upholds the rule of law and is thus a theory of jurisprudence.
A ruler should govern his subjects by the following trinity:
Fa (法 fa3): law or principle.
Shu (術 shù): method, tactic, art, or statecraft.
Shi (勢 shì): legitimacy, power, or charisma.
Legalism was the chosen philosophy of the Qin Dynasty. It was blamed for creating a totalitarian society and thereby experienced decline. Its main motto is: &quot;Set clear strict laws, or deliver harsh punishment&quot;. Both Shang Yang and Han Fei promoted the absolute adherence to the rule of law, regardless of the circumstances or the person. The ruler, alone, would possess the authority to dispense with rewards and punishments. Ministers were only to be rewarded if their words matched the results of their proposals, and punished if it did not; regardless if the results were worse or better than the claims. Legalism, in accordance with Han Fei's interpretation, could encourage the state to be a militaristic autarky. The philosophy was highly progressive, and extremely critical of the Confucian and Mohist schools. This would be used to justify Li Si's large scale persecutions of the other schools of thought during the Qin dynasty, and the invariable denunciation by Confucian scholars from the Han dynasty and onwards.

====Naturalists====

The School of Naturalists or the School of Yin-yang (陰陽家/阴阳家) was a Warring States era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements; Zou Yan is considered the founder of this school. His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth). In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of Yan and Qi. In later periods, these epistemological theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief. This school was absorbed into Taoism's alchemic and magical dimensions as well as into the Chinese medical framework. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the Ma Wang Dui texts and Huang Di Nei Jing.

====Mohism====

Mohism (Moism), founded by Mozi (墨子), promotes universal love with the aim of mutual benefit. Everyone must love each other equally and impartially to avoid conflict and war. Mozi was strongly against Confucian ritual, instead emphasizing pragmatic survival through farming, fortification, and statecraft. Tradition is inconsistent, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize general benefit. As motivation for his theory, Mozi brought in the Will of Heaven, but rather than being religious his philosophy parallels utilitarianism.

====Logicians====

The logicians (School of Names) were concerned with logic, paradoxes, names and actuality (similar to Confucian rectification of names). The logician Hui Shi was a friendly rival to Zhuangzi, arguing against Taoism in a light-hearted and humorous manner. Another logician, Gongsun Long, told the famous When a White Horse is Not a Horse dialogue. This school did not thrive because the Chinese regarded sophistry and dialectic as impractical.

====Agriculturalists====

Agriculturalism was an early agrarian social and political philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of agriculture, and societies are based upon &quot;people's natural prospensity to farm.&quot;

The Agriculturalists believed that the ideal government, modeled after the semi-mythical governance of Shennong, is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields, not his leadership. Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the division of labour, arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self-sufficiency. The Agriculturalists supported the fixing of prices, in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price.

====Buddhism====

Having originated in India some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, Buddhism arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the Northern and Southern, Sui and Tang Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about Laozi, founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to Buddha. Mahayana Buddhism was far more successful in China than its rival Hinayana, and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were Sengzhao and Daosheng. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the Chan sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the Zen sect.

In the mid-Tang Buddhism reached its peak, and reportedly there were 4,600 monasteries, 40,000 hermitages and 260,500 monks and nuns. The power of the Buddhist clergy was so great and the wealth of the monasteries so impressive, that it instigated criticism from Confucian scholars, who considered Buddhism as a foreign religion. In 845 Emperor Wuzong ordered the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, confiscating the riches and returning monks and nuns to lay life. From then on, Buddhism lost much of its influence.

      <comment>/* Type II Diabetes &amp; Physical Activity Prescription */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Type II diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects insulin levels within the body. The pancreas still produces insulin, however the amount is insufficient to the body’s needs and does not work effectively. Exercise is known to reduce the risk of developing Type II Diabetes. Although for those already diagnosed, regular physical activity can aid in reducing the severity of their condition. 
==Background==
Type II Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes world-wide.  There is no known cause for this condition; however there are a number of risk- factors that aid in developing this metabolic disease&lt;ref name=&quot;World Health Organisation&quot;&gt;World Health Organisation (2012). Diabetes. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/index.html Accessed on 16 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
These include environmental and genetic factors such as; physical inactivity, poor nutrition, overweight/obesity, family history, increased age and race &lt;ref&gt; The Australian Government: Department of Health and Ageing (2010). The Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK). http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/PageFiles/937/AUSDRISK%20Web%2014%20July%2010.pdf Accessed on 15 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Developing diabetes increases ones risk of developing major health complications later in life, such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure as well as neuropathies and retinopathies&lt;ref&gt;Stewart KJ. Exercise training and the cardiovascular consequences of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. JAMA: the journal of the American Medical Association 2002;288(13):1622-1631.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Currently there is no known cure for this metabolic disease&lt;ref&gt; Diabetes Australia (2012). Diabetes Australia - Diabetes Australia. http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/ Accessed on 15 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The best way to manage and decrease the severity of Type II Diabetes is through interventions such as: physical activity, diet and pharmaceuticals. 

Diabetes is a growing epidemic world-wide, with 347 million people suffering from this condition; of this 90% of people are classified as a Type II Diabetic &lt;ref name=&quot;World Health Organisation&quot; /&gt;. Although, due to the subtlety of symptoms and lack of awareness of Type II Diabetes, a large population actually have the disease but are completely unaware&lt;ref&gt;Herman WH, Smith PJ, Thompson TJ, Engelgau MM, Aubert RE. A new and simple questionnaire to identify people at increased risk for undiagnosed diabetes. Diabetes Care 1995;18(3):382-387.&lt;/ref&gt;. As age increases, the risk of developing this form of diabetes also increases.  However with the growing childhood obesity rate the age of onset is significantly decreasing. It is also more prevalent in Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Maori populations &lt;ref&gt;Shaw J, Sicree R, Zimmet P. Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030. Diabetes Res Clin Pract 2010;87(1):4-14.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Type II Diabetes &amp; Physical Activity Prescription==
Those with Type II Diabetes have elevated blood glucose levels due to the insufficient working of insulin within the body.  Physical activity is beneficial for diabetics, as it helps improve glycemic control and other diabetes complications.  Engaging in regular physical activity increases insulin sensitivity and allows for greater uptake of glucose, lowering blood glucose levels.  It has been determined that when exercise is conducted, the glucose transporter protein GLUT-4 is able to move to the plasma membrane to allow for the uptake of glucose without insulin &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy JW, Hirshman MF, Gervino EV, Ocel JV, Forse RA, Hoenig SJ, et al. Acute exercise induces GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle of normal human subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes 1999;48(5):1192-1197.&lt;/ref&gt;. GLUT-4 translocation is enhanced with exercise for up to 72 hours post exercise, allowing for skeletal muscle to uptake glucose more efficiently &lt;ref name=&quot;Albright&quot; /&gt;.  In turn, participating in regular physical activity assists in the lowering of plasma glucose levels as well as an increase in insulin sensitivity.  Also, physical activity in combination with a healthy diet aids in weight loss and reducing other diabetes risk factors such as heart disease and high blood pressure.
====Aerobic Training&lt;ref name=&quot;Albright&quot;&gt;Albright A, Franz M, Hornsby G, Kriska A, Marrero D, Ullrich I, et al. American College of Sports Medicine position stand. Exercise and type 2 diabetes. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2000;32(7):1345&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sigal RJ, Kenny GP, Wasserman DH, Castaneda-Sceppa C, White RD. Physical activity/exercise and Type 2 diabetes A consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Care 2006;29(6):1433-1438.&lt;/ref&gt;====
A person with Type II Diabetes should follow the below FITT principle to determine their training regime.  Each person will have a tailored training program depending on the severity of their condition, current fitness levels and relative adiposity.

'''Frequency''': 3-7 days per week

'''Intensity''': Each session should include
:* 40-60% Light - moderate exercise
:*&gt; 60% Vigorous exercise
'''Time''': Training session of greater than 30 minutes most days of the week is recommended for those with Type II Diabetes.  This can be split into the following:
:*&gt; 150 minutes per week of light - moderate exercise
:*&gt; 90 minutes per week of vigorous exercise 
'''Type''': Weight baring and non-weight baring exercises should be included depending on person.  Examples include:  walking, swimming and cycling.

====Resistance Training &lt;ref name=&quot;Albright&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kravitz L. The 25 most significant health benefits of physical activity and exercise. IDEA Fitness Journal 2007;4(9):54-63.&lt;/ref&gt;====
To begin a resistance exercise regime, it must first be determined what a person's 1 rep max (1RM) is equal to. This refers to the maximum amount of weight a person can lift in one single repetition.  Once this has been established, the following resistance program can be prescribed:
* Resistance level should be set between 30-50% of 1RM
* 8-10 repetitions for upper body exercises, including
::*Arm curls, bench press, military press
* 10-15 repetitions for lower body exercises, including
::*Squats, heel raises, knee extensions
* At least 8 exercises for both upper and lower body muscle groups
* Up to 3 sets per exercise
* Alternate between upper body and lower body exercises
* Rest time in between exercises between 30-60 seconds
* The use of lower repetitions combined with high resistances increases muscle strength
* The use of higher repetitions with low resistances increases endurance
Resistance training should be included in physical activity sessions at least 2 days per week.

==Conclusion==
There is no known cure for Type II Diabetes. However, the effects can be lessened through a healthier diet and in particular, exercise. Combining a resistance training regime with aerobic exercise can not only help with weight management, but also aids in lowering plasma glucose levels and increasing insulin sensitivity within cells. This significantly reduces the severity of Type II Diabetes and allows the patient to decrease their risks of long term and ongoing problems associated with diabetes.

The inverse problems, that are the main objects of this book, have its roots in the study of the relationships between local and global properties of graphs embedded in surfaces (2D manifolds). The two-dimensional setting has an important structure, due to the duality between harmonic conjugate functions on the embedded graphs and the connections to classical special matrices, that can be viewed as two-dimensional objects. Also, the dimensions of the unknown parameters fit the dimension of the measurement data in several important instances of the inverse problems. The ideas of the solutions of the inverse problems are presented in a way bridging the discrete and continuous domain settings. 

[[File:DN approximation (1).jpg|thumbnail| Discretisation technique]]

The techniques of solutions are motivated by the following commutative diagram:

[[File:Discrete and Contiuous Inverse problems.jpg|thumbnail]]

The context of the inverse problems provides a unified point of view on the work of many great mathematicians, and even though there are references to many areas of mathematics in this book, it is practically self-contained, and is intended for a wide audience of readers interested in the subject. There are exercises, ranked by difficulty, through most of the chapters of the book and it can be used as a textbook for an applied mathematics class.

      <comment>/* Breast cancer and exercise */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Breast cancer is one of the most important diseases worldwide in terms of incidence and mortality{{ref|5|5}}. In recent years the improvement of treatments for this disease has increased the survival rate. Physical exercise has consistently been identified as a central element of rehabilitation for many chronic diseases including several types of cancer{{ref|5|5}}. The main benefit of exercise when applied to breast cancer survivors is to improve quality of life and rehabilitation from the negative side effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Breast cancer is usually characterised into ductal or lobular carcinomas which occur in the tissue of the breast. The treatment for this type of cancer is usually determined by the size, stage, rate of growth and other characteristics of the cancer. Treatment for this particular cancer may include a combination of the following; surgery, hormonal drug therapy, chemotherapy, radiation and/or immunotherapy. The most effective method currently used is the surgical removal of any growths, which is usually combined with several chemotherapy regimens to increase the likelihood of cure. 
Breast cancer accounts for 22.9% of all cancers in women worldwide &lt;ref name=&quot;IARC GLOBOCAN 2008&quot; /&gt;.It has been shown to be less prevalent in developing countries and greatest in developed countries{{ref|11|11}}. The primary risk factors that are associated with an increase of morbidity are female sex and older age. Other associated risk factors are lack of childbearing or breastfeeding, higher hormone levels, diet and obesity. There are also risk factors associated with certain lifestyle choices, genetics and particular medical conditions.
The impact of cancer therapy is not limited to cancer cells but also causes deleterious effects on healthy tissues that result in acute and chronic physiological and psychological negative side effects in cancer survivors{{ref|10|10}}. Research has shown that these negative side effects can lead to deterioration of lean body tissue, lowered functional capacity, weight gain, difficulty in sleeping, fatigue, nausea, pain, depression, poor body image, and lowered self-concept{{ref|6|6}}.

== Breast cancer and exercise ==
The prolonged and repeated nature of breast cancer treatment has many negative side effects post treatment. Exercise for these survivors can be of great benefit in helping to increase the quality of life in many aspects. The quality of life outcomes that exercise has been found to help in include physical, functional, emotional, and social aspects. Some of the benefits that exercise has been shown to give are as an effective intervention to improve quality of life, cardio respiratory fitness, physical functioning and symptoms of fatigue in breast cancer patients and survivors{{ref|5|5}}. 
Exercise can benefit cancer survivors in a number of ways. Mood management is a benefit that is associated with exercise. From the research that has been done it has been shown that with the adoption of regular exercise regimens, significant improvements in anxiety, depression and self-esteem have been found{{ref|7|7}}. Weight gain is a troubling and common consequence following treatment for breast cancer particularly among women receiving adjuvant therapy. Fatigue from the treatment is another negative side effect of cancer treatment. It usually begins during radiation treatment and chemotherapy, increases over the course of treatment and may persist for months afterwards{{ref|6|6}}. Fatigue decreases patients’ activity levels, interferes with their ability to care for themselves, and with role functioning at home and work {{ref|8|8}}. Cross-sectional studies have shown that patients report that exercise is a very useful strategy to overcome fatigue {{ref|9|9}}. Another positive effect that exercise has been associated with in breast cancer survivors is improved sleeping patterns. Exercise or increased physical activity has long been an integral part of good sleep{{ref|6|6}}.

== Recommendations ==

In regard to recommendations a roundtable statement was presented at the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 57th Annual Meeting in June of 2010. The statement suggests that, unlike previous clinical recommendations, it is believed beneficial and is in fact recommended cancer survivors engage in some form of exercise modality post treatment. As for mentioned breast cancer survivors who exercise post treatment have demonstrated better overall quality of life and functional capacity. Although one of the conclusions of the statement was cancer survivors for the most part should adhere to the 2008 Federal Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (150 mins/wk of moderate intensity aerobic activity), it is recommended that breast cancer exercise prescription should undergo alteration to these guidelines given the specific nature of this form of cancer.  Current literature supports the implementation of both aerobic and strength training programs to improve the health related outcomes for breast cancer survivors {{ref|4|4}}. Exercise prescription should be tailored to the specific needs of the breast cancer survivor and should take into account severity of treatment and previous training history. A general guide to exercise prescription in regard to both aerobic and strength training programs are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Parameter !! Recommendation
|-
| Mode || Large muscle groups walking or cycling
|-
| Frequency || 3-5 times per week
|-
| Intensity || 50-80% of Vo2 max / RPE between 11-14
|-
| Duration || 20-30 minutes of continuous exercise 
|-
| Progression || Via frequency and duration initially then intensity

|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Parameter !! Recommendation
|-
| Mode || Free weights, body weight or machines 
|-
| Frequency || 3 times per week
|-
| Intensity || Light weights &lt;10% increments
|-
| Duration || 2 sets of 10 repetitions first 2 weeks, increase to 15 reps
|-
| Progression || Initially increase reps then sets, increases in resistance then return to 2 set model
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is primarily designed to show the reader how to modify drivers.

Perhaps this could be presented as a case study of porting a new board for a supported chip as an example.

Some drivers that could be explored are:
# clock
# console
# shmsupp
# startup
# timer

Another approach could be exploring modifying libbsp drivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cover only the managers not already covered.
Hard to list until previous chapters are written.  Some may be:
# Message Manager
# Event Manager
# Partition Manager
# Region Manager
# Dual-Ported Memory Manager
# I/O Manager
# Fatal Error Manager
# Barrier Manager
# User Extensions Manager
# Multiprocessing Manager
# Stack Bounds Checker

Try to cover these as soon as reasonable (before this chapter, if it can make sense) in the text.

== POSIX Threading API ==
Although the classic API was written first, POSIX is a modern, and widely used, standard for operating systems development (cite).  RTIED is also a standard, but primarily for embedded development.  So POSIX will be discussed first.
# POSIX Example 1: discuss what functionality it's testing, why that functionality is needed, and how to extend it.
# POSIX Example 2: discuss what functionality it's testing, why that functionality is needed, and how to extend it.
# POSIX Example 3: discuss what functionality it's testing, why that functionality is needed, and how to extend it.
# POSIX Scheduling Report: discuss what functionality it's testing, why that functionality is needed, and how to extend it.

== classic api: handling signals, and periodic tasks ==

Why handle tasks using signals, absolute periods, rate monotonic periods, and relative periods

What are signals, absolute periods, rate monotonic periods, and relative periods

Now that we've touched on scheduling, we will extending the example by using ...

== Blink Light Emitting Diode (LED): more on handling signals, and periodic tasks ==

Many sub-examples...
apply a pedagocal order...
cover these in depth...
may need to turn into its own chapter...

# complex1

# ratemon2
# ratemon_cond_server
# sem_server
# timeout_event

== Scheduling Priorities: Sched Sim ==
# Discuss why use scheduling priorities
# Discuss what scheduling priorities are
# Discuss how to use scheduling priorities
# The example will be extended using rtems-schedsim

      <text xml:space="preserve">Editing Notes:

-Consider including the tail length along with the full length in your “size” section
-In your “description” I’m not sure what color ‘buff’ is, maybe use another word more commonly used.
-You do a nice job of being concise, however I think you could add sentence starters to make things flow nicer….such as “The eastern grey squirrel lives in large woodland trees….” Or at least “They eat mainly nuts, buds, and flowers…”
-You need a “Notes” section (supposedly 200-300 words)
-Sources seem valid, make sure that you’re citing correctly, in wiki text format that was discussed in class

-Is there a more common name for the family “Cricetidae”? I think we are supposed to use a more general term such as “rodents” but I didn’t want to change it incase it was something else
-I would take out the “Muskrats are much larger…..the vole and the lemming” part  in your size section because most of the class’s size sections just include measurements and information like that could be included in the similar section where you distinguish from other animals in the same family.
-In your description section, I would take out the first sentence and talk solely about the physical description of the species.
-In your reproduction section, consider stating the gestation period before talking about how long it takes to mature
-Sentence fluency is REALLY good
-Make sure to cite the range and activity information
-Sources look good, citing is done correctly, nice work!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Editing Notes:

-Is there a more common name for the family? – I believe we are supposed to include the more common name, like yours is the Weasel family…so put “Weasel (Mustelidae)”
-I did some sentence fluency editing on your description
-In your diet section, what are they primarily…herbivores, carnivores etc?
-In your reproduction section, how long until the pups mature?
-Took out captivity information for lifespan, you only need for the wild.
-Cite the information for your description, similar species, range, habitat, reproduction, lifespan, and notes!
-Notes section may need to be longer…n the handout it says the note section should be 200-300 words
-Source validity looks good.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Make sure to cite all your sources!
Add a 200-300 word notes section.
&quot;Coarse&quot; hair not course.
In range, don't use &quot;his&quot; to describe all voles.
In life, don't say lives usually, say usually lives.

Other than that, most of the information is good and straight to the point good information, just make sure you cite it correctly from good sources!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would put the &quot; In order to maintain the overabundance of white-tailed deer, seasons are dedicated to deer hunting.&quot; that's in the &quot;range&quot; section possibly somewhere else, perhaps in the notes section, because this information does not pertain to the range of the deer and is therefore slightly irrelevant to be in this particular section, but it's still interesting so I would keep it and simply move it to the &quot;notes&quot;.</text>

Write more in notes
&quot;Native&quot;, not Home in range
Habitat is a run on sentence
Maybe start off the notes section with hibernation info so it flows nicer.
Great information, just make sure to cite and write more!!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the description section, I would move &quot;Peromyscus maniculatus have rounder bodies with large, black, beady eyes and large ears with little hair.&quot; to &quot;similar species&quot;, or take it out altogether since it's not specifying what it has rounder bodies, etc, to. You may or may just need to specify what you are comparing the peromyscus maniculatus to.

In the &quot;diet&quot; section, I would remove &quot;Deer mice will collect their food and bring some to store inside of their nest.&quot; because this isn't what they are eating, but more or less what they are doing with their food which isn't necessarily necessary. You could include that information in the &quot;activity&quot; section instead.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the description section, I would specify what the &quot;blunt tragus&quot; is further so that the common reader knows what it is.

In the lifespan section, it reads: &quot;Usually little brown bats live up to 6 to 7 years in the wild with the males leading longer lives than the females.&quot; ; is it possible to elaborate how much longer that the males live than the females?</text>

Imagine the following situation: A young man, let’s call him Knut, is sitting at his desk reading some papers which he needs to complete a psychology assignment. In his right hand he holds a cup of coffee. With his left one he reaches for a bag of sweets without removing the focus of his eyes from the paper. Suddenly he stares up to the ceiling of his room and asks himself:
“What is happening here?”

다음과 같은 상황을 상상해보자. 한 젊은이(이름은 크누트라고 하자)가 책상 앞에 앉아 심리학 과제를 하기 위해 논문을 읽고 있다. 오른손에는 커피 한 잔을 들고, 논문에서 눈을 떼지 않은 채로 과자 봉지를 향해 왼손을 뻗는다. 문득 그는 천장을 올려다보며 이렇게 자문한다.
 &quot;대체 여기에서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는 거지?&quot;

Probably everybody has had experiences like the one described above. Even though at first sight there is nothing exciting happening in this everyday situation, a lot of what is going on here is highly interesting particularly for researchers and students in the field of Cognitive Psychology. They are involved in the study of lots of incredibly fascinating processes which we are not aware of in this situation. Roughly speaking, an analysis of Knut's situation by Cognitive Psychologists would look like this:

아마도 우리 모두는 위와 비슷한 경험을 해본 적이 있을 것이다. 언뜻 보아 이 일상적인 상황에 재미있는 점이라곤 없는 것 같지만, 여기서 일어나고 있는 많은 일이 (특히) 인지심리학이라는 분야의 연구자와 학생들에게는 매우 흥미로운 것들이다. 이들은 우리는 자각하지 못하는 믿을 수 없으리만큼 매력적인 과정들에 대해 연구하고 있다. 크누트의 상황에 대한 인지심리학자들의 분석은 대강 아래와 같은 식이 될 것이다.

Knut has a problem, he really needs to do his assignment. To solve this problem, he has to perform loads of cognition. The light reaching his eyes is transduced into electrical signals traveling through several stations to his visual cortex. Meanwhile, complex nets of neurons filter the information flow and compute contrast, colour, patterns, positions in space, motion of the objects in Knut's environment. Stains and lines on the screen become words; words get meaning, the meaning is put into context, analyzed on its relevance for Knut's problem and finally maybe stored in some part of his memory. At the same time an appetite for sweets is creeping from Knut's [[w:Hypothalamus|hypothalamus]], a region in the brain responsible for controlling the needs of an organism. This appetite finally causes Knut to reach out for his sweets.

크누트에게는 문제가 있는데, 과제를 꼭 해야만 한다는 것이 그것이다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해, 그는 막대한 양의 인지 처리를 수행한다. 그의 눈으로 들어오는 빛은 전기적 신호로 변환되어 여러 구간을 지나 시각령(visual cortex)으로 보내진다. 그 동안 복잡한 신경망들은 정보흐름을 필터링하고 대조, 색상, 패턴, 공간 속의 위치, 크누트 주변에 있는 물체들의 움직임을 계산해낸다. 화면에 나타난 얼룩과 선들은 글자가 되고, 글자는 의미가 붙고, 의미는 맥락 속에 놓여져 크누트의 문제와 관련이 있는지 분석되고, 마침내는 어쩌면 기억공간의 몇몇 일부분에 저장될 것이다. 그와 동시에 과자를 먹고 싶은 욕구가 신체 영양상태의 조절을 책임지는 뇌의 구역인 [[w:Hypothalamus|시상하부]]에서 올라온다. 이 욕구로 인해 크누트는 끝내 과자를 향해 손을 뻗는다.

Now, let us take a look into the past to see how Cognitive Psychologists developed its terminology and methods to interpret ourselves on the basis of brain, behaviour and theory.

이제

==인지심리학의 역사==

Early thoughts on the other hand, claimed that knowledge was stored in the brain.

===르네상스와 그 이후===

Renaissance philosophers of the 17th century generally agreed with Nativists and even tried to show the structure and functions of the brain graphically. But also empiricist philosophers had very important ideas. According to [[w:David_Hume|David Hume]], the internal representations of knowledge are formed obeying particular rules. These creations and transformations take effort and time. Actually, this is the basis of much current research in Cognitive Psychology. In the 19th Century [[w:Wilhelm_Wundt|Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[w:Donders|Franciscus Cornelis Donders]] made the corresponding experiments measuring the reaction time required for a response, of which further interpretation gave rise to Cognitive Psychology 55 years later.
17세기의 르네상스 철학자들은 대체로 생득론을 지지했으며, 심지어 뇌의 구조와 기능을 시각적으로 나타내려고 하기도 했다. 하지만 경험주의 철학자들에게도 아주 중요한 아이디어가 있었다. [[w:David_Hume|데이비드 흄]]에 따르면 지식의 내적 표상은 특정한 규칙에 따라 형성된다. 이 창조와 변형의 과정에는 노력과 시간이 걸린다. 실제로 이것은 많은 현대 인지심리학 연구의 근본이 되는 생각이다. 19세기에는 [[w:Wilhelm_Wundt|빌헬름 분트]]와 [[w:Donders|Franciscus Cornelis Donders]]가 반응에 요구되는 반응시간을 측정하는 실험을 하였는데, 해당 실험의 발전된 해석은 55년후 인지심리학을 일으키게 된다.

===20세기와 인지혁명===

During the first half of the 20th Century, a radical turn in the investigation of cognition took place. Behaviourists like [[w:B._F._Skinner|Burrhus Frederic Skinner]] claimed that such mental internal operations - such as attention, memory, thinking – are only hypothetical constructs that cannot be observed or proven.  Therefore, Behaviorists asserted, mental constructs are not as important and relevant as the study and experimental analysis of behaviour (directly observable data) in response to some stimulus. According to Watson and Skinner, man could be objectively studied only in this way. The popularity of Behavioralist theory in the psychological world led investigation of mental events and processes to be abandoned for about 50 years. 
20세기의 전반 반세기 동안, 인지 연구에 근본적인 전환이 일어났다. [[w:B._F._Skinner|스키너]]와 같은 행동주의자들은 주의, 기억, 사고와 같이 심리 내적인 작용들은 관찰하거나 증명될 수 없는 가설적 구성물에 불과하다고 주장했다. 따라서 행동주의자의 주장으로는 심리적 구성물들은 자극에 대한 반응으로서의 행동(직접적으로 관찰가능한 데이터)에 대한 연구와 실험적 분석만큼 중요하거나 의미있는 것이 아니다. 왓슨과 스키너에 따르면 인간에 대한 객관적인 탐구는 오직 이러한 방법으로만 가능하다. 심리학계 내부에 계속된 행동주의 이론의 인기 때문에 약 50년동안 심적 현상과 작용에 대한 연구는 버려지게 되었다.

In the 1950s scientific interest returned again to attention, memory, images, language processing, thinking and consciousness. The “failure” of Behaviourism heralded a new period in the investigation of cognition, called [[w:Cognitive_revolution|Cognitive Revolution]]. This was characterized by a revival of already existing theories and the rise of new ideas such as various communication theories.  These theories emerged mainly from the previously created information theory, giving rise to experiments in signal detection and attention in order to form a theoretical and practical understanding of communication.  
50년대에는 과학적 관심이 주의와 기억, 심상, 언어처리, 사고, 의식으로 돌아온다. 행동주의의 &quot;실패&quot;는 [[w:Cognitive_revolution|인지혁명]]이라 불리는, 인지 연구에 대한 새로운 시대가 도래했음을 예고했다. 이것은 이미 존재하던 이론의 부활과 다양한 커뮤니케이션 이론과 같은 새로운 아이디어의 발흥으로 특징지어질 수 있다. 이 이론들은 예전에 창시된 정보이론에서 출현한 것으로, 신호검출에 관한 실험에 활기를 띄게 하고, 의사소통의 이론적, 실용적 이해를 형성하고자 하는 점에 주의를 끌게 했다.

Modern linguists suggested new theories on language and grammar structure, which were correlated with cognitive processes. [[w:Chomsky|Chomsky’s]] Generative Grammar and Universal Grammar theory, proposed language hierarchy, and his critique of Skinner’s “Verbal Behaviour” are all milestones in the history of Cognitive Science. Theories of memory and models of its organization gave rise to models of other cognitive processes. Computer science , especially artificial intelligence, re-examined basic theories of problem solving and the processing and storage of memory, language processing and acquisition. 
현대 언어학자들은 인지처리와 밀접한 관련이 있는 언어와 문법구조에 관한 새로운 이론을 제시했다. [[w:Chomsky|촘스키]]의 생성문법과 보편문법 이론, 언어 위계, 스키너의 &quot;언어적 행동(Verbal Behaviour)&quot;에 대한 그의 비판은 모두 인지과학의 역사의 획기적인 사건으로 꼽힌다. 컴퓨터과학, 특히 인공지능은 문제해결과 기억의 작용 및 저장, 언어의 처리와 습득에 대한 기본 이론을 재검토했다.

[[w:Neuroinformatics|Neuroinformatics]], which is based on the natural structure of the human nervous system, tries to build neuronal structures by the idea of artificial neurons. In addition to that, Neuroinformatics is used as a field of evidence for psychological models, for example models for memory. The artificial neuron network “learns” words and behaves like “real” neurons in the brain. If the results of the artificial neuron network are quite similar to the results of real memory experiments, it would support the model. In this way psychological models can be “tested”. Furthermore it would help to build artificial neuron networks, which posses similar skills like the human such as face recognition. 
[[w:Neuroinformatics|신경정보과학]]은 인간 신경계의 자연구조에 기반한 학문으로, 인공뉴런의 개념을 이용해 신경계 구조를 만들어보려고 하는 분야이다. 신경정보과학은 심리학적 모형을 증명하는 분야로 이용되고 있는데, 기억에 관한 모형을 예로 들 수 있다. 인공신경망은 단어를 '학습'하며, 뇌에 들어있는 '진짜' 뉴런들과 같이 행동한다. 인공신경망의 결과가 실제 기억실험의 결과와 매우 비슷하게 나온다면, 그 모형은 지지될 수 있다. 이러한 방법으로 심리학의 이론적 모형들을 '시험'해볼수 있다. 더 나아가서 인공신경망이 안면인식(face recognition)과 같은 기술에서 인간과 비슷한 능력을 갖게 만드는데 도움이 될 수 있다.

If more about the ways humans process information was understood, it would be much simpler to build artificial structures, which have the same or nearly the abilities. The area of cognitive development investigation tried to describe how children develop their cognitive abilities from infancy to adolescence. The theories of knowledge representation were first strongly concerned with sensory inputs. Current scientists claim to have evidence that our internal representation of reality is not a one-to-one reproduction of the physical world. It is rather stored in some abstract or neurochemical code. Tolman, Bartlett, Norman and Rumelhart made some experiments on cognitive mapping. Here, the inner knowledge seemed not only to be related to sensory input, but also to be modified by some kind of knowledge network modeled by past experience. 
인간이 정보를 처리하는 방법을 더 많이 이해할수록, 인간과 같거나 비슷한 능력을 갖춘 인공적 구조를 만들기는 더욱 간단해질 것이다. 인지적 발달에 관한 연구분야에서는 어떻게 어린이들이 유아기부터 청소년기까지 인지능력을 발달시키는지 기술하려 노력했다. 지식표현 이론은 감각적 입력에 가장 많이 관련되어있는 분야이다. 현재의 과학자들은 현실에 대한 우리의 내적인 표상이 물리적 세계를 그대로 복제한 것이 아니라고 한다. 그렇기보다는 무언가 추상적인 관념이나 신경화학적인 코드로 저장되는 것에 가깝다. 톨만(Tolman)과 바틀렛(Bartlett), 노먼(Norman), 러멜하트(Rumelhart)는 인지적 표상에 관한 몇가지 실험을 하였다. 그 실험에서, 내적인 지식은 감각적 입력에만 관련되어있지 않았고, 과거의 경험에 의해 구성된 일종의 지식네트워크에 영향을 받는 것으로 보여졌다.

Newer methods, like [[w:Electroencephalography|Electroencephalography (EEG)]] and [[w:fmri|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] have given researchers the possibility to measure brain activity and possibly correlate it to mental states and processes. All these new approaches in the study of human cognition and psychology have defined the field of Cognitive Psychology, a very fascinating field which tries to answer what is quite possibly the most interesting question posed since the dawn of reason. There is still a lot to discover and to answer and to ask again, but first we want to make you more familiar with the concept of Cognitive Psychology.
[[w:Electroencephalography|뇌파 전위 기록술]](Electroencephalography;EEG)과 [[w:fmri|기능자기공명영상]](fMRI)과 같은 새로운 기법은 연구자들에게 두뇌 활동을 측정할 수 있게 해주었고, 가능컨데 이 두뇌활동을 심리적 상태와 과정에 연관시킬 수 있는 가능성을 열어주었다. 인간의 인지와 심리에 대한 이러한 모든 새로운 접근법은 인지심리학의 분야를 정의한다. 이 아주 매력적인 분야는 계몽의 시대(the dawn of reason)로부터 제기돼 왔던 아마도 가장 흥미로운 질문들에 답하려 노력하고 있다. 아직 발견하고 답변하고 다시 물어볼 것들이 많이 있지만, 우선 인지심리학이라는 개념에 대해 좀더 알아보기로 한다.

==인지심리학이란 무엇인가?==

The easiest answer to this question is: “Cognitive Psychology is the study of thinking and the processes underlying mental events.” Of course this creates the new problem of what a mental event actually is. There are many possible answers for this:
이 질문에 대한 가장 쉬운 질문은 &quot;인지심리학은 사고과 심적 현상 아래에 있는 절차에 대한 학문이다&quot;가 될 것이다. 물론 이것은 '심적 현상이 무엇인가'라고 하는 또 다른 문제를 만든다. 질문에 답하는 방법은 이와 같이 많은 것들이 있을 수 있다.

Let us look at Knut again to give you some more examples and make the things clearer. He needs to focus on reading his paper. So all his attention is directed at the words and sentences which he perceives through his visual pathways. Other stimuli and information that enter his cognitive apparatus - maybe some street noise or the fly crawling along a window - are not that relevant in this moment and are therefore attended much less. Many higher cognitive abilities are also subject to investigation. Knut’s situation could be explained as a classical example of problem solving: He needs to get from his present state – an unfinished assignment – to a goal state - a completed assignment - and has certain operators to achieve that goal. Both Knut’s short and long term memory are active. He needs his short term memory to integrate what he is reading with the information from earlier passages of the paper. His long term memory helps him remember what he learned in the lectures he took and what he read in other books. And of course Knut’s ability to comprehend language enables him to make sense of the letters printed on the paper and to relate the sentences in a proper way. 
좀더 예를 들어서 확실히 하기위해 크누트씨에게 다시 시선을 돌리기로 하자. 그는 논문을 읽는데 집중해야 한다. 따라서 그의 모든 주의는 그의 시지각 경로를 통해 지각되는 단어와 문장에 집중된다. 다른 기관으로 들어오는 자극과 정보들은 - 아마 길거리 소음이나 창문가에 기어다니는 파리겠지만 - 이 상황에 별로 상관이 없으므로, 더 적은 주의만을 받게 된다. 많은 고등 인지능력도 탐구의 대상이다. 크누트씨의 상황은 문제해결에 대한 고전적인 예로 설명될 수 있다. 그는 그의 현재상태(과제가 안 끝남)에서 목적상태(과제가 끝남)으로 가야하며, 이 목적을 달성하기 위한 여러 기관들을 가지고 있다. 크누트씨의 단기기억과 장기기억 작용은 활발하다. 지금 읽고 있는 부분과 바로 전에 읽고 있었던 부분의 정보를 하나로 통합하기 위해서는 단기기억이 필요하다. 장기기억은 전에 들은 강의와 읽은 책의 내용을 기억하게 해준다. 그리고 물론 언급해야겠지만, 크누트씨가 가진 언어이해능력은 종이에 인쇄된 글자의 의미를 파악하고, 문장들을 올바른 방법으로 연관시킬 수 있게 해준다.

This situation can be considered to reflect mental events like perception, comprehension and memory storage. Some scientists think that our emotions cannot be considered separate from cognition, so that hate, love, fear or joy are also sometimes looked at as part
of our individual minds. Cognitive psychologists study questions like: How do we receive information about the outside world? How do we store it and process it? How do we solve problems? How is language represented? Here is a more detailed overview:
이 상황은 지각, 이해, 기억과 같은 심적 현상을 반영하는 것으로 생각할 수 있다. 일부 과학자들은 감정도 인지작용과 분리해서 볼 수 없다고 생각해서, 증오나 사랑, 두려움, 기쁨도 각각이 가진 정신의 일부분으로 본다. 인지심리학자들은 다음과 같은 질문을 탐구한다. 우리는 어떻게 외부세계에 대한 정보를 얻는가? 이 정보를 어떻게 저장하고 처리하는가? 어떻게 문제를 해결하는가? 언어는 어떻게 표현되는가? 더 자세한 개요를 살펴보자: (다음에 뭔가 나와야할 것같은데 원문이 미완성인가 봄)

We hope you now have some idea what Cognitive Psychology is and what is involved in it.
이제 인지심리학이 무엇이고 그 안에 어떤 주제들이 있는지 좀더 잘 이해할 수 있게 되었길 바란다.

==신경과학과의 관계==

===인지신경심리학===

Of course it would be very convenient if we could understand the nature of cognition without the nature of the brain itself. But unfortunately it is very difficult if not impossible to build and prove theories about our thinking in absence of neurobiological constraints. Neuroscience comprises the study of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, brain functions and related psychological and computer based models. For years, investigations on a neuronal level were completely separated from those on a cognitive or psychological level. The thinking process is so vast and complex that there are too many conceivable solutions to the problem of how cognitive operation could be accomplished.
물론 뇌의 본질에 대한 이해 없이 인지의 본질을 이해할 수 있었더라면 아주 편리했을 것이다. 하지만 안타깝게도 신경생물학적인 제약이 없는 상태에서 사고에 대한 이론을 만들고 검증하는 것은 아주 어렵거나 불가능하다. 신경과학은 신경해부학과 신경생리학, 뇌의 기능 및 관련된 심리학적, 전산학적 모형에 대한 연구 등으로 구성된다. 수 년간 뉴런 수준에서의 연구는 인지적, 심리학적 수준에서의 연구와 완전히 분리되어있었다. 사고작용은 너무나 방대하고 복잡해서 인지적 작업이 어떻게 이뤄질 수 있는가에 대한 생각할 수 있는 답변이 너무나도 많다.

Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact. The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research. It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions. The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before. This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand processes in our mind. As neuroscience is not always able to explain all the observations made in laboratories, neurobiologists turn towards Cognitive Psychology in order to find models of brain and behaviour on an interdisciplinary level – Cognitive Neuropsychology. This “inter-science” as a bridge connects and integrates the two most important domains and their methods of research of the human
mind. Research at one level provides constraints, correlations and inspirations for research at another level.
신경생물학적 자료는 인지를 탐구하는 이론적 접근에 대한 물리적인 증거를 제공한다. 따라서 연구분야는 더욱 세분화되고 더욱 정확하게 된다. 신경질환과 행동에 상관관계는 과학자들의 연구를 돕는다. 여러가지 다른 종류의 뇌손상, 트라우마, 장애, 종양 등은 행동에 영향을 주며 마음의 기능에 변화를 일으킨다는 것이 오랫동안 알려져 있다. 새로운 기술의 등장으로 전에는 볼 수 없었던 뇌의 구조와 작용을 보고 연구할 수 있게 되었다. 이것을 통해 마음의 작용을 이해하는데 도움을 주는 시뮬레이션 모형에 필요한 많은 정보와 자료를 얻을 수 있다. 신경과학 그 자체로는 실험실에서 관찰한 모든 것을 다 설명할 수 없기 때문에, 신경과학자들은 인지심리학으로 눈을 돌려 학제 수준에서 뇌와 행동에 대한 모델을 찾게 되었으며, 그 결과물이 바로 '인지신경심리학(Cognitive Neuropsychology)'이다. 이 '중간과학(inter-science)'은 다리로서 두가지 가장 중요한 영역과 그 인간 마음에 대한 연구 방법을 연결하고 통합한다. 연구는 한 수준에서는 제약을 부여하고, 다른 수준에서는 상관 관계 및 후속 연구를 위한 영감을 제공한다.(수정필요)

===신경해부학적 기초===

The basic building blocks of the brain are a special sort of cells called [[w:Neuron|neurons]]. There are approximately 100 billion neurons involved in information processing in the brain. When we look at the brain superficially, we can't see these neurons, but rather look at two halves called the [[w:Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]]. The hemispheres themselves may differ in size and function, as we will see later
in the book, but principally each of them can be subdivided into four parts called the lobes: the [[w:Temporal_lobe|temporal]], [[w:Parietal_lobe|parietal]], [[w:Occipital_lobe|occipital]] and [[w:Frontal_lobe|frontal lobe]]. This division of modern neuroscience is supported by the up- and down-bulging structure of the brain's surface. The bulges are called gyri (singular gyrus), the creases sulci (singular sulcus). They are also involved in information processing. The different tasks performed by different subdivisions of the brain as attention,
memory and language cannot be viewed as separated from each other, nevertheless some parts play a key role in a specific task. For example the parietal lobe has been shown to be responsible for orientation in space and the relation you have to it, the occipital lobe is mainly responsible for visual perception and imagination etc. Summed up, brain anatomy poses some basic constraints to what is possible for us and a better understanding will help us to find better therapies for cognitive deficits as well as guide research for cognitive psychologists. It is one goal of our book to present the complex interactions between the different levels on which the brain that can be described, and their implications for Cognitive Neuropsychology.
뇌를 이루고 있는 기본 단위는 [[w:Neuron|뉴런]]이라고 하는 특별한 종류의 세포다. 대략적으로 1000억 개 정도의 뉴런이 뇌에서 일어나는 정보처리에 참여하고 있다.
겉으로만 보면, 이 뉴런들은 보이지 않고 대신 [[w:Cerebral hemisphere|대뇌반구]]라고 부르는 반반씩 나뉜 두 부분이 보인다. 나중에 살펴보겠지만, 두 반구는 서로 크기와 기능에 있어서 다른 경우가 많다. 하지만 근본적으로는 그 반구 각각은 엽(葉, lobe)이라고 하는 부분으로 다시 나눌 수 있는데, 나열하자면 [[w:Temporal_lobe|측두엽]], [[w:Parietal_lobe|두정엽]], [[w:Occipital_lobe|후두엽]], [[w:Frontal_lobe|전두엽]]이다. 이러한 현대 신경과학의 구분은 뇌 표면의 주름에 따라 밖으로 튀어나오고, 안으로 들어가는 접힌 구조에 기반한다. 튀어나온 부분을 회(回, gyrus)라고 하고, 들어간 주름 부분을 구(溝, sulcus)라고 한다. 그런 것들도 정보처리 과정에 참여하고 있다. 다른 종류의 작업은 다른 구역에서 이뤄지고 있긴 하지만 주의와 기억, 언어는 서로 분리해서 볼 수 없다. 그래도 일부 부분이 특정한 작업에는 주도적인 역할을 한다. 예를 들어 두정엽은 공간 안의 방향과 그것에 대한 자신과의 관계를 담당하고 있는 것으로 보여져왔고, 후두엽은 시각인지와 심상 등을 주로 담당하고 있다. 요약하자면, 뇌의 해부구조는 인간에게 무엇이 가능한지에 대한 기본적인 제약을 이루고 있고, 뇌에 대한 더 나은 이해는 인지적 장애를 위한 더 나은 치료법을 찾는 것뿐만 아니라 인지심리학자들의 연구를 안내하는 지도로서도 도움을 줄 수 있다는 것이다. 이 책의 한가지 목표는 기술될 수 있는 뇌의 서로 다른 수준사이의 복잡한 상호작용 및 인지신경심리학에 대한 함의를 보여주는 것이다.

===연구방법===

Newer methods, like EEG and fMRI etc. allow researchers to correlate the behaviour of a participant in an experiment with the brain activity which is measured simultaneously. It is possible to record neurophysiological responses to certain stimuli or to find out which brain areas are involved in the execution of certain mental tasks. EEG measures the electric potentials along the skull through electrodes that are attached to a cap. While its spatial resolution is not very precise, the temporal
resolution lies within the range of milliseconds. The use of fMRI benefits from the fact the increased brain activity goes along with increased blood flow in the active region. The [[w:Haemoglobin|haemoglobin]] in the blood has magnetic properties that are registered by the fMRI scanner. The spatial resolution of fMRI is very precise in comparison to EEG. On the other hand, the temporal resolution is in the range of just 1-2 seconds.
EEG, fMRI 등과 같은 새로운 연구방법은 연구자들이 실험에서 보이는 피실험자의 행동을 동시에 측정되는 뇌의 활동과 연결시킬 수 있게 해준다. 특정 자극에 대한 신경생리학적 반응들을 기록할 수도 있고, 뇌의 구역들이 어떤 인지적 작업을 실행하는데 연관되어있는지 알아낼 수도 있다. EEG는 모자에 붙어있는 전극을 통해 두개골을 따라 흐르는 전기 포텐셜을 측정한다. 공간 해상도(spatial resolution)가 아주 높지는 않은 반면에 시간 해상도(temporal resolution)는 수 밀리세컨드의 범위 안으로 들어간다. fMRI는 뇌의 활동량이 증가하는 곳을 따라 뇌의 혈류량이 함께 증가한다는 사실을 이용한 것이다. 혈액 속의 [[w:Haemoglobin|헤모글로빈]]은 fMRI 스캐너로 인식할 수 있는 자기적 특성을 가졌다. fMRI의 공간 해상도는 EEG와 비교해서 매우 높다. 한편으로 시간 해상도는 1-2초 범위 안에 들어간다.

==결론==

Remember the scenario described at the beginning of the chapter. Knut was asking himself “What is happening here?” It should have become clear that this question cannot be simply answered with one or two sentences. We have seen that the field of Cognitive Psychology comprises a lot of processes and phenomena of which every single one is subject to extensive research to understand how cognitive abilities are produced by our brain. In the following chapters of this WikiBook you will see how the different areas of research in Cognitive Psychology are trying to solve the initial question raised by Knut.
이 장의 처음 부분에 나왔던 이야기를 다시 떠올려보자. 크누트씨는 스스로 &quot;여기서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는거지?&quot;라고 묻고 있었다. 이젠 이 질문에 단순히 한두 문장으로 답할 수 없다는 것이 명백해졌을 것이다. 지금까지 인지심리학이라는 분야가 각각의 단위들이 우리 뇌에서 인지능력에 어떻게 만들어지는지 이해하기 위한 광대한 연구의 주제가 되는 많은 심리적 작용과 현상들로 구성되어 있는 것을 보았다.(읭...ㅠ) 다음 장에서는 인지심리학의 다른 연구분야들이 어떻게 쿠누트씨가 처음에 했던 질문을 해결하려고 하는지 볼 것이다.</text>

:RE: Provides database and schema independence.

Database independence means that the application can switch databases without impacting their code.
Schema independence means that the schema could change (the names of the tables/column, but also some structure) and the application could would be un-effected.  Where as hard coded SQL would need to be updated with the new table/column names.  Obviously, if you add a new column, you will need to add a new attribute to your object, and update your application to make use of this attribute (although some JPA providers support dynamic objects/attributes that allow columns to be added without Java code changes).

      <text xml:space="preserve">When describing the muzzle and legs it may be less wordy to combine long legs and muzzle together and then state small ears. Also, in the range section you state that the gray wolf used to be highly populated but you did not state why they are no longer in certain areas. If there may be a lot of information about possible extinction of this species you could include it in your notes section. The notes section should include about 100 to 200 words but you are missing this section. Extinction is one possibility but are there other interesting facts you learned about the gray wolf when conducting your research? When reading over your activity section you state that the gray wolf is crepuscular, but does it hibernate or migrate during certain seasons? Overall, the information you provided is a great start and allows a brief insight into the gray wolf’s characteristics and behaviors, but there is room for more information.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">One piece of information that may be incorrect is the family name for the Eastern Cottontail. You have listed rabbits and hares but generally the family name is a broader scientific category. When I used Google to find the family name for the Eastern Cottontail I came across the name: Leporidae, does this match any of your sources? Great information within your activity section! The only thing I would add is the term crepuscular to your definition of being active during the dawn and dusk hours. That way your audience can learn to recognize the term and it is defined below in our glossary. Your lifespan information is also very informative. The only question I have is why do they die of shock when in captivity? Is there any type of factual evidence to support the why in this statement? One final suggestion is that the notes section should be between 100 to 200 words. Is there anything else you learned during your research that you found interesting and want to let the audience know about?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In your opening paragraph about the size of the Northern Myotis you include that the tragus is longer than other bats. Perhaps you could use this in your similar species section to show how they differentiate. When reading through your description the only thing that stands out that may confuse readers is the term cartilaginous structure. Is there a way you could further explain what this means or simplify it? Remember the audience may not be an expert in the field. In your similar species section the only thing I recommend changing is using italics when stating a species scientific name. In your diet section you have a sentence that says, “which often are often captured by gleaning,” you should revise this sentence and omit one of the oftens. In the activity section you state that the Northern Myotis hibernate and are primarily nocturnal but do they migrate at all? The reproduction section states twice that the Northern Myotis gives birth to only one bat. This could be fixed by eliminating one of the sentences to avoid redundancy. You have a wonderful notes section that is extremely informative! Overall, the content is very well laid out the only changes I would make are small.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you're writing, what do you do to emphasize a particularly important idea to your readers? It's sloppy writing to explicitly state that you're making a really important point. Additionally, you can't capitalize, bold or make your text larger to set it apart. The solution to show emphasis is to italicize your text (which you can do with any work processing software with the ''I'' icon. When you stress something with italics, it doesn't need to be a complete sentence, rather you can merely be stressing the importance of one or two words. Indeed, sometimes when you might be tempted to point out the amazing quality of a fact with an exclamation point, italicization is a much better tool to use. For example take this hypothetical &quot;fact&quot;:

&quot;My friend taught himself how to read over ten thousand words per minute!&quot;

&quot;My friend taught himself how to read ''over ten thousand words per minute''.&quot;

Other times that italics should be used when writing include titles of books, plays or movies or foreign words that have not come into common usage in the English language (for example &quot;laissez-faire&quot; and &quot;entrepreneur&quot; are both French words, but they have been completely integrated with the English language). ''A Tale of Two Cities'' by Charles Dickens takes place during the French Revolution, the era of ''Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Medieval society and social classes==

===Early Middle Ages===

====New societies====

Although the political structure in western Europe had changed after the fall of the Roman Empire, the divide was not as extensive as some historians have claimed. Although usually described as &quot;invasions&quot;, they were not always just military expeditions but were mostly caused by the movement of peoples immigrating into the Empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to either support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Ricimer (d. 472), Gundobad (d. 516), or Aspar (d. 471), and when the western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background as those military strongmen. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of the Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies which allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters. Material artifacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, with tribal items often being obviously modeled on Roman objects. Similarly, much of the intellectual culture of the new kingdoms was directly based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer provided their armies with tax revenues, instead allocating land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms. Slavery declined as the supply declined, and society became more rural.
[[File:Theoderic Quarter Siliqua 80000847.jpg|thumb|Coin of Theodoric.]]

Between the 5th and 8th centuries, new peoples and powerful individuals filled the political void left by Roman centralized government. The Ostrogoths settled in Italy in the late 5th century under Theodoric (d. 526) and set up a kingdom marked by its cooperation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths, at least until the last years of Theodoric's reign. The Burgundians settled in Gaul, and after an earlier kingdom was destroyed by the Huns in 436, formed a new kingdom in the 440s between today's Geneva and Lyon. This grew to be a powerful kingdom in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In northern Gaul, the Franks and Britons set up small kingdoms. The Frankish kingdom was centered in northeastern Gaul and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric, who died in 481. Under Childeric's son Clovis (r. 509–511), the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity. The Britons, related to the natives of Britannia, settled in what is now Brittany, which took its name from their settlement. Other kingdoms were established by the Visigoths in Spain, the Suevi in northwestern Spain, and the Vandals in North Africa. In the 6th century, the Lombards settled in northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over all of them. By the late 6th century this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy.

With the invasions came new ethnic groups into parts of Europe, but the settlement was uneven, with some regions such as Spain having a larger settlement of new peoples than other places. Gaul's settlement was uneven, with the barbarians settling much thicker in the northeast than in the southwest. Slavonic peoples settled in central and eastern Europe and into the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on Latin but distinct. These changes from Latin to the new languages like French or Portuguese or Romanian took many centuries, however, and went through a number of stages. Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavonic languages to the mix.

====Western society====

Society in Western Europe changed with the new rulers. Some of the Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with Church than secular affairs. The older values of Latin classics scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained an important skill, it became a practical skill. In the 4th century, Jerome dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of instruction in the Church ceased to be the book and was replaced with music and art. With laymen, a similar change took place, with the aristocratic culture focusing on great feasts held in halls. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces of the time. Family ties between the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds, however, seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation usually ending the feud. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in terms of their functions as wives or mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society, the lack of many child rulers meant less role for women as queen mothers but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were considered as always under the protection and control of some male relative.

Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform, with some areas having greatly fragmented landholding patterns and other areas with a pattern of large, contiguous blocks of land being the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies with some being dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, however, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over a number of generations through military service to a powerful lord.

====Women====
[[File:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Eve spinning.jpg|left|thumb|Spinning by hand was a traditional form of women's work. ''Hunterian Psalter,''  c. 1170. Glasgow University Library.]]

The Roman Catholic Church was a major unifying, cultural influence of the Middle Ages with its selection from Latin learning, preservation of the art of writing, and a centralized administration through its network of bishops. Historically in the Catholic and other ancient churches, the role of bishop, like the priesthood, was restricted to men. The first Council of Orange (441) also forbade the ordination of deaconesses, a ruling that was repeated by the Council of Epaon (517) and second Council of Orléans (533).

With the establishment of Christian monasticism, other roles within the Church became available to women. From the 5th century onward, Christian convents provided opportunities for some women to escape the path of marriage and child-rearing, acquire literacy and learning, and play a more active religious role. Abbesses could become important figures in their own right, often ruling over monasteries of both men and women, and holding significant lands and power. Figures such as Hilda of Whitby (c. 614–680) became influential figures on a national and even international scale.

For most of the Middle Ages, until the introduction of beer made with hops, brewing was done largely by women; this was a form of work which could be carried out at home. In addition, married women were generally expected to assist their husbands in business. Such partnerships were facilitated by the fact that much work occurred in or near the home. However, there are recorded examples from the High Middle Ages of women engaged in a business other than that of their husband.

Midwifery was practiced informally, gradually becoming a specialized occupation in the Late Middle Ages. Women often died in childbirth, although if they survived the child-bearing years, they could live as long as men, even into their 70s. Life expectancy for women rose during the High Middle Ages, due to improved nutrition.

As with peasant men, the life of peasant women was difficult. Women at this level of society had considerable gender equality, but this often simply meant shared poverty. Until nutrition improved, their life expectancy at birth was significantly less than that of male peasants: perhaps 25 years. As a result, in some places there were 4 men for every 3 women. The late medieval poem ''Piers Plowman'' paints a pitiful picture of the life of the medieval peasant woman:

:&lt;small&gt;&quot;Burdened with children and landlords' rent;
:What they can put aside from what they make spinning they spend on housing,
:Also on milk and meal to make porridge with
:To sate their children who cry out for food
:And they themselves also suffer much hunger,
:And woe in wintertime, and waking up nights
:To rise on the bedside to rock the cradle,
:Also to card and comb wool, to patch and to wash,
:To rub flax and reel yarn and to peel rushes
:That it is pity to describe or show in rhyme
:The woe of these women who live in huts&quot;&lt;/small&gt;

===High Middle Ages===
[[File:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|left|thumb|Medieval French manuscript illustration of the three classes of medieval society: clergy, knights, and the peasantry. The relationship between these classes was governed by feudalism and manorialism. ''Li Livres dou Sante'', 13th century.]]

The High Middle Ages saw an expansion of population. Rough estimates of the increase from the year 1000 until 1347 indicate that the population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million. The exact cause or causes of the growth remain unclear; improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been put forward. As much as 90 percent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many of them, however, were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained, however, a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond.
[[File:Limbourg brothers - Les très riches heures du Duc de Berry - January (detail) - WGA13017.jpg|thumb|John, Duke of Berry enjoying a grand meal; ''Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry'', ca 1410.]]

Other sections of society included the nobility, clergy and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled and simple knights, were the exploiters of the manors and the peasants, although they did not own lands outright, rather they were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the customs of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son. The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and the various immunities from taxes or other impositions that the nobles enjoyed. Heavy cavalry had been introduced into Europe from the Persian cataphract of the 5th and 6th centuries, but the addition of the stirrup in the 7th allowed the full force of the horse and rider to be used in combat. Stone castles began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorders of the time, and allowed inhabitants to take refuge from invaders. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords.

The clergy was divided into two types – the secular clergy who lived in the world, and the regular clergy, or those who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the ranks of the nobility, the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centers were founded.

In Central and Northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were, to a degree, self-governing, stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Besides new trading opportunities, the agricultural and technological improvements enabled the increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, at first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared amongst merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also emerged, to allow easy transmission of money through the trading networks.

====Women====
[[File:SaintRadegondeMural.jpg|left|thumb|Eleanor of Aquitaine was a wealthy and powerful woman.]]

During the High Middle Ages, numerous women seemed to have achieved large amounts of political, religious, and economic power. For example, Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204) was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in Western Europe during the High Middle Ages. She was the patroness of such literary figures as Wace, Benoît de Sainte-More, and Chrétien de Troyes. Eleanor succeeded her father as ''suo jure'' Duchess of Aquitaine and Countess of Poitiers at the age of fifteen, and thus became the most eligible bride in Europe.

Herrad of Landsberg, Hildegard of Bingen, and Héloïse d’Argenteuil were influential abbesses and authors during this period. Hadewijch of Antwerp was a poet and mystic. Constance of Sicily, Urraca of León and Castile, Joan I of Navarre, Melisende of Jerusalem and other Queens regnant exercised political power.

Female artisans in many occasions, like their male maids, organised in guilds.

Regarding the role of women in the Church, Pope Innocent III wrote in 1210: &quot;No matter whether the most blessed Virgin Mary stands higher, and is also more illustrious, than all the apostles together, it was still not to her, but to them, that the Lord entrusted the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven&quot;.

===Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Plague victims blessed by priest.jpg|thumb|A medieval manuscript illustration of a bishop blessing victims of the Black Death.]]

The first years of the 14th century were marked by a number of famines, culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–1317. The causes of the Great Famine were not just related to the ongoing climatic change that was taking place, a slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, but also had causes in overspecialization in single crops, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. Other troubles included an economic downturn and the aforementioned climate change – which resulted in the average annual temperature for Europe declining 2 degrees Celsius during the 14th century. These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a disease that spread throughout Europe in the years 1348, 1349, and 1350. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in total in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of the crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Because of the sudden decline in available labourers, the price of wages rose as landlords sought to entice workers to their fields, but the lower rents were balanced out by the lower demand for food, which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, which manifested itself in the foundation of new charities, the extreme self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of the Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century. It continued to strike Europe throughout the rest of the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Middle Ages&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
[[File:Christine de Pisan and her son.jpg|thumb|Christine de Pizan became a professional writer after the death of her husband in 1390.]]

In the Late Middle Ages women such as Saint Catherine of Siena and Saint Teresa of Avila played significant roles in the development of theological ideas and discussion within the church, and were later declared Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church. The mystic Julian of Norwich was also significant in England.

Isabella I of Castile ruled a combined kingdom with her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon, and Joan of Arc successfully led the French army on several occasions during the Hundred Years' War.

Christine de Pizan was a noted late medieval writer on women's issues. Her Book of the City of Ladies attacked misogyny, while her Treasure of the City of Ladies articulated an ideal of feminine virtue for women from walks of life ranging from princess to peasant's wife. Her advice to the princess includes a recommendation to use diplomatic skills to prevent war:

:&lt;small&gt;&quot;If any neighbouring or foreign prince wishes for any reason to make war against her husband, or if her husband wishes to make war on someone else, the good lady will consider this thing carefully, bearing in mind the great evils and infinite cruelties, destruction, massacres and detriment to the country that result from war; the outcome is often terrible. She will ponder long and hard whether she can do something (always preserving the honour of her husband) to prevent this war.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
:
From the last century of the Middle Ages onwards, restrictions began to be placed on women's work, and guilds became increasingly male-only. Female property rights also began to be curtailed during this period.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Women in the Middle Ages&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Middle_Ages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and social class in Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''==
[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as pilgrim.]]
The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield, yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions. Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealized in order to strengthen their fighting ability. Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, often its conflicting values degenerated into violence. Church leaders often tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. The Knight's Tale shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealize, with both knights willing to fight the other to the death in order to win her. Chivalry was in Chaucer's day on the decline, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed. Chaucer himself had fought in the Hundred Years' War under Edward III, who heavily emphasized chivalry during his reign. Two tales, The Tale of Sir Topas and The Tale of Melibee are told by Chaucer himself, who is traveling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry—the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.

The Tales constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of the three estates; the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being &quot;those who pray&quot; (the clergy), &quot;those who fight&quot; (the nobility), and &quot;those who work&quot; (the commoners and peasantry). Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some &quot;quit&quot; (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the Tales to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition &quot;the ordered and the grotesque, Lent and Carnival, officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.&quot; Several works of the time contained the same opposition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the great misconceptions of writing that the end product is more important than the process by which that product is achieved. This is not necessarily true. A good writing 'product' will only be achieved through an adequate writing process. Writing as a product implies something very static. A solid block of text that always was and always will be. Writing as a process reflects the realities of writing. Sometimes writing is just difficult. You can suffer from writer's block and you can't think of anything to write. Or you can have a sudden burst of energy and fill a page, only to realize upon revision that what seemed so brilliant at 3 am now makes no sense at all. Some people find this aspect of writing to be frustrating. However, if you accept writing as a process, you can begin to appreciate these are merely natural stages of the writing process. Good writing takes time and effort. Writing as a process requires you to rethink your ideas and contemplate dramatic revisions ranging from adding additional paragraphs to scraping your argument altogether.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Great Chain of Being 2 (lighter).png|thumbnail|Image depicting the &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot;]]
In this section, we will examine the social hierarchies and culture that emerged from the Medieval Era. Central to this topic is an understanding to the medieval philosophical/religious conception of how the universe was ordered. 

==The Great Chain of Being==
One of the most important ideas that governed medieval society was that of the &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot;. The Great Chain of being held that all life (as medievals thought of it, although you will see some things in the chain were not 'alive' according to modern science) in the world was structured in an elaborate hierarchy of authority. At the top ruled God followed by the different classes of angels, demons (fallen/renegade angels), stars, the moon, kings, princes, nobles, men, wild animals, domesticated animals, trees, other plants, precious stones, precious metals, and other minerals. 

God, and beneath him, the angels, both existing wholly in spirit form, sit at the top of the chain. Earthly flesh is fallible and ever-changing: mutable. Spirit, however, is unchanging and permanent. This sense of permanence is crucial to understanding this conception of reality. It is generally impossible to change the position of an object in the hierarchy. (One exception might be in the realm of alchemy, where alchemists attempted to transmute base elements, such as lead, into higher elements, either silver, or, more often, gold—- the highest element.)

In the natural order, earth (rock) is at the bottom of the chain: this element possesses only the attribute of existence. Each link succeeding upward contains the positive attributes of the previous link and adds (at least) one other. Rocks, as above, possess only existence; the next link up, plants, possess life and existence. Animals add not only motion, but appetite as well.

Man is both mortal flesh, as those below him, and also spirit as those above. In this dichotomy, the struggle between flesh and spirit becomes a moral one. The way of the spirit is higher, more noble; it brings one closer to God. The desires of the flesh move one away from God. The Christian fall of Lucifer is thought of as especially terrible, as angels are wholly spirit, yet Lucifer defied God, the ultimate perfection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Mesoamerica (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Mesoamerica.]]

Mesoamerica is a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which a number of pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries.

As a cultural area, Mesoamerica is defined by a mosaic of cultural traits developed and shared by its indigenous cultures. Beginning as early as 7000 BC the domestication of maize, beans, squash and chili, as well as the turkey and dog, caused a transition from paleo-Indian hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex mythological and religious tradition, a vigesimal numeric system, and a complex calendric system, a tradition of ball playing, and a distinct architectural style, were diffused through the area. Also in this period villages began to become socially stratified and develop into chiefdoms with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods such as obsidian, jade, cacao, cinnabar, Spondylus shells, hematite, and ceramics. While Mesoamerican civilization did know of the wheel and basic metallurgy, neither of these technologies became culturally important.

Among the earliest complex civilizations was the Olmec culture which inhabited the Gulf coast of Mexico and extended inland and southwards across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Frequent contact and cultural interchange between the early Olmec and other cultures in Chiapas, Guatemala and Oaxaca laid the basis for the Mesoamerican cultural area. This formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes. In the subsequent Preclassic period, complex urban polities began to develop among the Maya with the rise of centers such as El Mirador, Calakmul and Tikal and the Zapotec at Monte Albán. During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi-Olmec and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script. Mesoamerica is one of only five regions of the world where writing was independently developed. In Central Mexico, the height of the Classic period saw the ascendancy of the city of Teotihuacan, which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area and northward. Upon the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 CE, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic period the Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of Oto-Manguean languages. During the early post-Classic period Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture, Oaxaca by the Mixtec, and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chichén Itzá and Mayapán. Towards the end of the post-Classic period the Aztecs of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mesoamerica.

The distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, and over the next centuries Mesoamerican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule. Aspects of the Mesoamerican cultural heritage still survive among the indigenous peoples who inhabit Mesoamerica, many of whom continue to speak their ancestral languages, and even maintain certain cultural practices harking back to their Mesoamerican roots.

==Cultural chronology==

The history of human occupation in Mesoamerica is divided among a number of stages or periods. These are known, with slight variation depending on region, as the Paleo-Indian, the Archaic, the Preclassic (or Formative), the Classic, and the Postclassic. The last three periods, representing the core of Mesoamerican cultural fluorescence, are further divided into two or three sub-phases. Most of the time following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century is lumped into the Colonial period.

The differentiation of early periods (i.e., up through the end of the Late Preclassic) generally reflects different configurations of socio-cultural organization that are characterized by increasing socio-political complexity, the adoption of new and different subsistence strategies, and changes in economic organization (including increased interregional interaction). The Classic period through the Postclassic are differentiated by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of the various political entities throughout Mesoamerica.

===Paleo-Indian===

The Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian period precedes the advent of agriculture and is characterized by a nomadic hunting and gathering subsistence strategy. Big-game hunting, similar to that seen in contemporaneous North America, was a large component of the subsistence strategy of the Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian. Evidence for this time period in Mesoamerica is sparse and the documented sites scattered c. 10,500 BCE. These include Chivacabé, Los Tapiales, and Puerta Parada in the highlands of Guatemala, Orange Walk in Belize, and the El Gigante cave in Honduras. These latter sites had a number of obsidian blades and Clovis-style fluted projectile points. Fishtail points, the most common style in South America, were recovered from Puerta Parada, dated to c. 10,000 BCE, as well as other sites including Los Grifos cave in Chiapas (c. 8500 BCE) and Iztapan (c. 7700–7300 BCE), a mammoth kill site located in the Valley of Mexico near Texcoco.

===Archaic===

The Archaic period (8000–2000 BCE) is characterized by the rise of incipient agriculture in Mesoamerica. The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with sedentism and agricultural production by the close of the period. Archaic sites include Sipacate in Escuintla, Guatemala, where maize pollen samples date to c. 3500 BCE. The well-known Coxcatlan cave site in the Valley of Tehuacán, Puebla, which contains over 10,000 teosinte cobs (an antecedent to maize), and Guila Naquitz in Oaxaca represent some of the earliest examples of agriculture in Mesoamerica. The early development of pottery, often seen as a sign of sedentism, has been documented at a number of sites, including the West Mexican sites of Matanchén in Nayarit and Puerto Marqués in Guerrero. La Blanca, Ocós, and Ujuxte in the Pacific Lowlands of Guatemala yielded pottery dated to c. 2500 BCE.

===Preclassic/Formative===
[[File:ES San Andres 05 2012 Estructura 1 La Acropolis 1562.JPG|thumb|Main pyramid at the Acropolis Mayan site, San Andres, El Salvador.]]

The first complex civilization to develop in Mesoamerica was that of the Olmec, who inhabited the gulf coast region of Veracruz throughout the Preclassic period. The main sites of the Olmec include San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, La Venta, and Tres Zapotes. Although specific dates vary, these sites were occupied from roughly 1200 to 400 BCE. Remains of other early cultures interacting with the Olmec have been found at Takalik Abaj, Izapa, and Teopantecuanitlan, and as far south as in Honduras. Research in the Pacific Lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala suggest that Izapa and the Monte Alto Culture may have preceded the Olmec. Radiocarbon samples associated with various sculptures found at the Late Preclassic site of Izapa suggest a date of between 1800 and 1500 BCE.

The Middle and Late Preclassic period witnessed the rise of the Maya in the southern Maya highlands and lowlands and at a few sites in the northern Maya lowlands. The earliest Maya sites coalesced after 1000 BCE, and include Nakbe, El Mirador, and Cerros. Middle to Late Preclassic Maya sites include Kaminaljuyú, Cival, Edzná, Cobá, Lamanai, Komchen, Dzibilchaltun, and San Bartolo, among others.

The Preclassic in the central Mexican highlands is represented by such sites as Tlapacoya, Tlatilco, and Cuicuilco. These sites were eventually superseded by Teotihuacán, an important Classic era site that eventually dominated economic and interaction spheres throughout Mesoamerica. The settlement of Teotihuacan is dated to later portion of the Late Preclassic, or roughly 50 CE.

In the Valley of Oaxaca, San José Mogote represents one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, and one of the first to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive palisades, ceremonial structures, the use of adobe, and hieroglyphic writing. Also importantly, the site was one of the first to demonstrate inherited status, signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure. San José Mogote was eventual overtaken by Monte Albán, the subsequent capital of the Zapotec empire, during the Late Preclassic.

The Preclassic in western Mexico, in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, and Michoacán also known as the Occidente, is poorly understood. This period is best represented by the thousands of figurines recovered by looters and ascribed to the &quot;shaft tomb tradition&quot;.

By the first millennium, South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains, and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. Some groups formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were the Chibchas (or &quot;Muiscas&quot; or &quot;Muyscas&quot;), Valdivia and the Tairona. The Chibchas of Colombia, Valdivia of Ecuador, the Quechuas of Peru, and the Aymara of Bolivia were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America. From the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, Brazil, leading to claims about an ancient complex Amazonian civilization.

The theory of pre-Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and Polynesia has received support from several lines of evidence, although solid confirmation remains elusive. A diffusion by human agents has been put forward to explain the pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of several cultivated plant species native to South America, such as the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) or sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Direct archaeological evidence for such pre-Columbian contacts and transport has been lacking, however. A 2007, paper published in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' put forward DNA and archaeological evidence that domesticated chickens had been introduced into South America via Polynesia by late pre-Columbian times. These findings were challenged by a later study published in the same journal, that cast doubt on the dating calibration used and presented alternative Mitochondrial DNA analyses that disagreed with a Polynesian genetic origin. The origin and dating remains an open issue. Whether or not early Polynesian-American exchanges occurred, there are no discernible human-genetic, archaeological, cultural or linguistic legacies of that contact.

==Cultures==

===Norte Chico or Caral civilization===

On the north-central coast of present-day Peru, Norte Chico or Caral (as known in Peru) was a civilization that emerged around 3000 BCE (contemporary with urbanism's rise in Mesopotamia.) It is considered one of the six cradles of civilization in the world. It had a cluster of large-scale urban settlements of which the Sacred City of Caral, in the Supe valley, is one of the largest and best studied sites. Norte Chico or Caral is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and persisted until around 1800 BCE.

[[File:Caral Ciudadela.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The ancient city of Caral.]]

===Valdivia Culture===

The Valdivia culture was concentrated on the coast of Ecuador. Their existence was recently discovered by archeological findings. Their culture is the oldest in the Americas, spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE. The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza. They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing, though occasionally they hunted for deer. From the remains that have been found, scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize, kidney beans, squash, cassava, hot peppers, and cotton plants, the last of which was used to make clothing. Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical, but it became showy, delicate, and big over time. They generally used red and gray colors; and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In its ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works.

===Cañaris===

The Cañari were the indigenous natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces of Cañar and Azuay. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs. The Inca destroyed and burned most of their remains. The Cañari's old city was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of Tomipamba, and later by the colonial city of Cuenca. The city was also believed to be the site of El Dorado, the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia.

The Cañari were most notable for having repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to Tupac Yupanqui. Many of their descendants are still present in Cañar. The majority did not mix with the colonists or become Mestizos.

===Chavín culture===

The Chavín, a South American preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. The Chavín civilization spanned from 900 to 300 BCE.

===Chibchas===

The Chibcha linguistic communities were the most numerous, the most territorially extended and the most socio-economically developed of the pre-Hispanic Colombians. By the 3rd century, the Chibchas had established their civilization in the northern Andes. At one point, the Chibchas occupied part of what is now Panama, and the high plains of the Eastern Sierra of Colombia.
The areas which they occupied in Colombia were the present-day Departments of Santander (North and South), Boyacá and Cundinamarca. This is where the first farms and industries were developed. It is also where the independence movement originated. They are currently the richest areas in Colombia. The Chibcha developed the most populous zone between the Mayan and Inca empires. Next to the Quechua of Peru and the Aymara in Bolivia, the Chibcha of the eastern and north-eastern Highlands of Colombia developed the most notable culture among the sedentary indigenous peoples in South America.

In the Oriental Andes, the Chibcha comprised several tribes who spoke the same language (Chibchan). They included the following: the Muisca, Guane, Lache, Cofán, and Chitareros.

===Moche===

The Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru approximately 1,500–2,000 years ago. The heritage of the Moche is seen in their elaborate burials. Some were recently excavated by UCLA's Christopher B. Donnan in association with the National Geographic Society.

As skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people. They traded with distant peoples such as the Maya. What has been learned about the Moche is based on study of their ceramic pottery; the carvings reveal details of their daily lives. The Larco Museum of Lima, Peru has an extensive collection of such ceramics. They show that the people practiced human sacrifice, had blood-drinking rituals, and that their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as fellatio).

===Inca Empire==

Holding their capital at the great cougar-shaped city of Cuzco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as Tawantinsuyu, or &quot;the land of the four regions&quot;, in Quechua, the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer road system. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful brain surgery in Inca civilization.


[[File:Machu Picchu Panorama.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The iconic Machu Picchu, symbol of the Inca civilization.]]

===Cambeba===

Also known as the Omagua, Umana and Kambeba, the Cambeba are an indigenous people in Brazil's Amazon valley. The Cambeba were a populous, organized society in the late Pre-Columbian era whose population suffered steep decline in the early years of the Columbian Exchange. The Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana traversed the Amazon River during 16th Century and reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river. These populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they used local wood as their construction material as stone was not locally available. While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians, their semi-nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, aristocracy. Archaeological evidence has revealed the continued presence of semi-domesticated orchards, as well as vast areas of land enriched with terra preta. Both of these discoveries, along with Cambeba ceramics discovered within the same archaeological levels suggest that a large and organized civilization existed in the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Andean civilizations==

The Andean civilizations made up a loose patchwork of different cultures that developed from the highlands of Colombia to the Atacama Desert. The Andean civilizations are mainly based on the cultures of Ancient Peru and some others such as Tiahuanaco. 

The Inca Empire was the last sovereign political entity that emerged from the Andean civilizations before conquest by Spaniards. The Inca Empire was a patchwork of languages, cultures and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. For example, the Chimú used money in their commerce, while the Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labor. (It is said that Inca tax collectors would take the head lice of the lame and old as a symbolic tribute.) The portions of the Chachapoya that had been conquered were almost openly hostile to the Inca, and the Inca nobles rejected an offer of refuge in their kingdom after their troubles with the Spanish. Spanish rule did bring Hispanic influences to the Andean region albeit a social, ethnic and cultural segregation occurred in varying degrees. Spanish rule ended or transformed many elements of the Andean civilizations influencing notably religion and architecture.

==Cultures==

===Norte Chico or Caral civilization===
[[File:PeruCaral01.jpg|thumb|The Caral pyramids in the arid Supe Valley, some 20 km from the Pacific coast.]]

The Norte Chico or Caral civilization was a complex pre-Columbian society that included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the six sites where civilization separately originated in the ancient world. It flourished between the 30th century BCE and the 18th century BCE. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, is derived from the Sacred City of Caral in the Supe Valley, a large and well-studied Norte Chico site. Complex society in Norte Chico arose a millennium after Sumer in Mesopotamia, was contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids, and predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.

===Chavín culture===

The Chavín culture in Peru is thought to have been primarily a religious cult. The culture apparently began in the Andes highlands and then spread outward throughout the country. The Chavín culture has very distinctive art styles, particularly in effigy pots, a number of which were in feline shapes. Chavin de Huantar was an important ritual centre for Chavin Culture, dating to around 1,500 BCE.

===Valdivia culture===

The Valdivia Culture is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the Santa Elena peninsula near the modern-day town of Valdivia, Ecuador between 3500 BCE and 1800 BCE.

===Nazca culture===

The Nazca culture (also Nasca) was the archaeological culture that flourished from 100 to 800 CE beside the dry southern coast of Peru in the river valleys of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage and the Ica Valley (Silverman and Proulx, 2002). Having been heavily influenced by the preceding Paracas culture, which was known for extremely complex textiles, the Nazca produced an array of beautiful crafts and technologies such as ceramics, textiles, and geoglyphs (most commonly known as the Nazca lines). They also built an impressive system of underground aqueducts, known as puquios, that still function today. The Nazca Province in the Ica Region was named for this people.

===Moche culture===
[[File:Condormuseolarco.jpg|left|thumb|The Moche culture is world-renowned for its pottery, in picture a Condor from about 300 CE.]]

The Moche civilization (alternately, the Mochica culture, Early Chimu, Pre-Chimu, Proto-Chimu, etc.) flourished in northern Peru from about 100 CE to 800 CE, during the Regional Development Epoch. While this issue is the subject of some debate, many scholars contend that the Moche were not politically organized as a monolithic empire or state. Rather, they were likely a group of autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture, as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems. Moche history may be broadly divided into three periods – the emergence of the Moche culture in Early Moche (100–300 CE), its expansion and florescence during Middle Moche (300–600 CE), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (500–750 CE).

===Tiwanaku===

Tiwanaku (Spanish: Tiahuanaco and Tiahuanacu) is an important Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia, South America. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important precursors to the Inca Empire, flourishing as the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of Lake Titicaca in the La Paz Department, Ingavi Province, Tiwanaku Municipality, about 72&amp;nbsp;km (45&amp;nbsp;mi) west of La Paz. The site was first recorded in written history by Spanish conquistador and self-acclaimed &quot;first chronicler of the Indies&quot; Pedro Cieza de León. Leon stumbled upon the remains of Tiwanaku in 1549 while searching for the Inca capital Qullasuyu. Some have hypothesized that Tiwanaku's modern name is related to the Aymara term taypiqala, meaning &quot;stone in the center&quot;, alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world. However, the name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost, as the people of Tiwanaku had no written language.

===Chachapoyas culture===

The Chachapoyas, or the 'Cloud people', were an Andean civilization living in the cloud forests of the Amazonas region of present-day northern Peru. The Incas conquered the Chachapoyas shortly before the arrival of the Spanish in Peru. The first firm evidence of the existence of their existence dates back to around 600 CE, although it is possible that they built a settlement called Gran Pajáten where some ceramics have been dated to 200 BCE. The largest Chacapoyan site discovered so far is Kuelap. A number of mummified burial sites have also been discovered.[11]
[edit]Wari
Main article: Wari culture
The Wari (Spanish: Huari) were a Middle Horizon civilization that flourished in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru, from about CE 500 to 1000. (The Wari culture is not to be confused with the modern ethnic group and language known as Wari', with which it has no known link.) Wari, as the former capital city was called, is located 11&amp;nbsp;km (6.8&amp;nbsp;mi) north-east of the modern city of Ayacucho, Peru. This city was the center of a civilization that covered much of the highlands and coast of modern Peru. The best-preserved remnants, beside the Wari Ruins, are the recently discovered Northern Wari ruins near the city of Chiclayo, and Cerro Baul in Moquegua. Also well-known are the Wari ruins of Pikillaqta (&quot;Flea Town&quot;), a short distance south-east of Cuzco en route to Lake Titicaca.

===Chimú culture===
[[File:Atuendoritualchimumuseolarco.jpg|thumb|Chimú gold adornments. 1300 CE Larco Museum, Lima-Perú.]]

The Chimú were the residents of Chimor, with its capital at the city of Chan Chan, a large adobe city in the Moche Valley of present-day Trujillo, Peru. The culture arose about 900 CE. The Inca ruler Tupac Inca Yupanqui led a campaign which conquered the Chimú around 1470 CE.

This was just fifty years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers were able to record accounts of Chimú culture from individuals who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly, Archaeological evidence suggest Chimor grew out of the remnants of Moche culture; early Chimú pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate.

===Inca Empire===

The Inca Empire, established by the Quechua-speakers, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco in modern-day Peru. The Inca civilization arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century. From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, including large parts of modern Ecuador, Peru, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and north-central Chile, and southern Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of the Old World.

The Inca empire was highly bureaucratic. The emperor, believed to be a descendent of the God Viracocha, creator of the world in Inca religious tradition, headed the bureaucracy. The state controlled land distribution, relocated conquered peoples, and kept careful population data by recording births, marriages, and deaths. The emperor grouped all his subjects into administrative units overseen by a governor. Conquered peoples owed the state periodic labor, known as ''mita''. Some met this requirement by working on large state farms. Others met it through military service, work on state construction projects, or toiling in state mines. The state also maintained centers for cloth-making, which were populated by young girls selected by the state and given instruction in Inca ideology. These girls would later become the wives of men chosen by the state or sent to serve as priestesses in temples. The practice of instructing particular children in Inca ideology applied to boys, too. The state ordered the sons of conquered leaders to the Inca capital of Cuzco to learn the Quechua language and study Inca culture.

===Muisca people===
[[File:Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|thumb|La balsa Muisca (The Muisca raft), a pre-Columbian gold sculpture representing the Muisca´s offerings of gold.]]

Muisca was the Chibcha-speaking people that formed the Muisca Confederation of the central highlands of present-day Colombia. They were encountered by the Spanish Empire in 1537, at the time of the conquest. The Muisca comprised two confederations: the Hunza (Tunja) of the northern area, whose sovereign was the Zaque; and the Bacatá of the southern area, whose sovereign was the Zipa. Both confederations were located in the highlands of modern-day Cundinamarca and Boyacá (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) in the central area of Colombia's Eastern Range.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you write a sentence, make sure that your subject and verb agree. Fore example, do not use the plural first person conjugation of a verb when your subject is the singular first person. &quot;I are&quot; is wrong and it sounds wrong. Now, it's hopefully unlikely that you'd make such an obvious mistake, but there are tricky situations in which you might not be sure which verb form to use that often arise when combining subjects. For example &quot;You/He/She/They and I&quot; will take the plural first person conjugation. The conjunction 'and' in this sentence makes all the difference. If it were &quot;You/He/She/They or I&quot; will simply take the singular first person. &quot;You or I am&quot; not &quot;You or I are&quot;. 

Also remember that some words take singular third person form when you would think they take plural form. For example, the word 'everyone'. &quot;Everyone knows&quot; is correct, not &quot;Everyone know&quot;. On the other hand, remember &quot;All people know&quot; not &quot;All people knows&quot;. Just remember the 'one' in 'everyone' is an important distinction. It implies each individual, whereas 'all people' implies a collective whole. Other words like 'everyone' include each, each one, either, neither, everybody, anybody, anyone, nobody, somebody, someone, and no one. All take singular third person form. 

The good news is that in English, many verbs take the same form no matter how you conjugate them (I eat, you eat, he/she/it eats, we eat, they eat).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chalk brood is a disease which affects honey bee larvae, caused by the fungus Acosphaera Apis. It is regarded as endemic, meaning that low levels of chalk brood are probably present in every colony, but not all colonies are badly affected by it. The dead larvae sometimes appear like small chips of chalk, hence the name chalk brood. 
Chalk brood is spread via fungal spores which are ingested by the larvae. The spores form hyphae inside the body of the larva which initially give it a slightly swollen appearance and a spongy consistency. The larva normally dies after being capped over, and ends up as a shrivelled &quot;mummy&quot; with a dark head. The body of the mummy may be white or black; the black colour is caused by the fruiting bodies of the fungus which release new spores.
There are two main ways to combat chalk brood. The first is to reduce stress on the colony by keeping it warm, dry, well fed and free of other diseases. The second is selective breeding, as resistance to chalk brood can be genetically inherited.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Insomnia is a sleeping disorder characterised by:
* Difficulty initiating sleep&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Difficulty maintaining sleep&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Decreased quality and quantity of sleep&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
Insomnia is more prevalent in adulthood and worsens with age, especially in those over 65. If left untreated, it can lead to more severe medical conditions&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It can also affect quality of life and have a negative impact on non-sleeping parts of the day by decreasing mood, causing fatigue, decreasing concentration and cognitive ability during the day.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

==Treatment==
There are several different types of treatments available for insomnia:
*'''CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy)''': Which includes Sleep Hygiene&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, Stimulus control&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and Relaxation Technique&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Medications''': Which includes Hypnotic Medications, Antidepressants&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, Opioids&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and Antihistamines
* '''Other treatments''': Natural substances such as magnesium, melatonin, valerian and medical marijuana have shown to have effective responses to helping insomnia&lt;sup&gt;10 11&lt;/sup&gt;

==Aerobic and Resistance Exercise==
Research has shown that both aerobic and resistance exercises help reduce the effects of insomnia by:
* '''Decreasing''' time onset to sleep and number of sleep disturbances&lt;sup&gt;1 12&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''Increasing''' sleep quality and total sleep time&lt;sup&gt;1 13&lt;/sup&gt;
These changes in sleeping patterns importantly lead to: '''decreases''' in daytime dysfunction and pre-sleep anxiety &lt;sup&gt;1 12&lt;/sup&gt;, '''increases''' in mood and quality of life&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

==Recommendations and Considerations==
The following recommendations refer to the ideal training for maximum efficiency at reducing the effects of insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Aerobic Exercise''':
* 3–4 days per week for 30–40 minutes at a moderate intensity&lt;sup&gt;1 3&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercises can include walking, cycling and low impact aerobics&lt;sup&gt;1 3 12 &lt;/sup&gt;
'''Resistance Exercise''':
* 2–3 days per week completing 2-3 sets, 10 repetitions 6-8 exercises &lt;sup&gt;1 12&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercises that utilize bother lower and upper muscle groups, including bench press, leg press, leg extension and shoulder press&lt;sup&gt;1 14&lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercises completed at 50% 1RM (moderate intensity)&lt;sup&gt;1 14&lt;/sup&gt;
'''Considerations''':
* Age: As insomnia is more common in persons aged 65+ it is important to ensure their training program is appropriate.Persons over the age of 65 should consult a doctor or healthcare professional prior to commencing a training program
* Exercise-Induced Insomnia and Time of Day: High intensity exercise can cause exercise-induced insomnia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Exercising before bed time can also lead to exercise-induced insomnia. High intensity exercise and exercise in the afternoon should be avoided to decreased the symptoms of insomnia&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

This demonstrates the '''fundamentals''' and advanced topics of '''[[w:hydroculture|hydroculture]]''' gardening including: [[w:aquaponics|aquaponics]], [[w:hydroponics|hydroponics]], {{lw|aquascaping|}}/[[w:water garden|aquatic gardening]], [[w:aeroponics|aeroponics]], [[w:passive hydroponics|passive-hydroponics]], plus hydroculture related gardening. Symbiotic aquatic animals are for ornamental purposes, since this book's focus is horticultural.

Food production for consumption, medicinal value and [[horticulture|horticultural]] aesthetics are purposes for building a hydroculture garden. Also included are root zone and aeration basics, along with plant nutrition fundamentals. Ranging in this book is from low cost simple ways to highly complex expensive ways of growing soil-less or water-based gardening. Projects can be used for self-sustainability to reducing food costs, supplementing food, medicinal implementation, aesthetic value or growing food where there is scarcity of resources or income (for example in developing nations).

There is a section on '''DIY hydroculture''' projects. The easiest method of maintaining the nutrient solution is to use aquaponics, which can be combined with any other form of hydroculture. Other methods may leave little room for error, and may require expertise in automation, measuring equipment, maintenance and chemistry knowledge.

Roots must breathe oxygen. There is a limit to the amount of dissolved gasses that can be contained in water. [[w:Aquatic plant|Aquatic plant]] roots do not need direct access to oxygen in the water or medium, because these plants are [[w:Aerenchyma|adapted to transport oxygen throughout its physiological system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Common hydroponic aggregates. Only materials that have a higher air to water retention ratio are included.
==Expanded clay==
[[w:Expanded clay aggregate|Expanded clay pellets]] are a common hydroculture substrate.

==Growstones==
[[w:Growstones|Growstones]] are a substrate for growing plants that can be used for [[w:hydroculture|soilless]] purposes or as a [[w:soil conditioner|soil conditioner]]. This substrate is made from recycled glass. It has both more air and water retention space than [[w:perlite|perlite]] and [[w:peat|peat]]. Another property of this medium is that it holds more water than [[w:Rice hulls#Fertilizer and substrate|parboiled rice hulls]].

==Parboiled rice hulls==
[[w:Rice hulls#Fertilizer and substrate|Rice hulls that are parboiled (PBH)]] are a substrate or medium for gardening, including certain [[hydroculture]]s. This medium decays over time. Rice hulls allow drainage,&lt;ref name=&quot;woodfiber pgr&quot;/&gt; and retain less water than growstones.&lt;ref name=&quot;growstones rice&quot;/&gt; A study showed that rice hulls don't affect the effects of [[w:plant hormone|plant growth regulators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;woodfiber pgr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2010/101025LopezHulls.html | title=Rice hulls a sustainable drainage option for greenhouse growers | publisher=Purdue University | date=October 25, 2010 | accessdate=August 30, 2012 | author=Wallheimer, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood fiber==
'''Wood fiber''' reduces the effects of growth suppressant hormones, used for uniform growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;woodfiber pgr&quot;/&gt;

==Cocopeat==
[[w:cocopeat|Coco fiber]] is a common hydroculture aggregate made from coconut hulls.

==Gravel==
[[w:Gravel|Gravel]] is good to be layered on the bottom. It allows better drainage near from the plastic net-pot. Placing seeds too close to plastic allows them to rot easier.

{{HydrocultureTOC}}

Following pertains to [[w:plant minerals|plant minerals]] and [[w:pH|pH]] levels.
Dilute 1 tablespoon of fertilizer in a gallon container with water at a time before adding to system. (Adding too little is safer than adding too much).
For non-hydroponic fertilizers use 1/10 of the dosing on the label, with the amount of water in the container in mind. The [[w:hoagland solution|hoagland solution]] provides a basic reference point. (Please do more research on this).

==Essential elements==
[[File:GETOE is Liquid Organics Fertillizer.jpg|100px|right]]
Calcium, carbon, hydrogen, magnesium, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium,  and sulfur are essential macro-elements. Oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon are obtained from water and air.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot;&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Resh
 | first = Howard
 | title = Hydroponics: Questions and Answers for successful growing
 | publisher = New Concept Press
 | year = 1998
 | location = Mahwah, New Jersey
 | pages =
 | url = http://www.howardresh.com/Howard-Resh-Books.html#
 | isbn = 0-931231-96-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur can be fixed by certain [[w:endophyte|endophyte]] bacteria.

Boron, chlorine, copper, iron, magnesium, molybdenum, zinc and possibly nickel are essential micro-nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

Hard tap water contains many plant nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

==Nonessential minerals==
There are other minerals used or taken up by plants, but they are not considered essential.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;
Some nonessential minerals are contaminants to plant or human health.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

==pH==
[[w:Sodium bicarbonate|Sodium bicarbonate]] helps buffer pH levels, and fortunately some may already be present in tap water.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

==Testing==
[[File:Taschenphmeter.jpg|100px|right]]
Measuring the conductivity of the water (using a multimeter) is a way of analyzing the total dissolved solids. This indicates whether the water solution is within range, but this method doesn't test for nutrient imbalances. Test paper, or a pH and nutrient meter is required for more testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

==Formulations==
* 1 ppm=1&amp;nbsp;mg/l &lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

The weight ratio of an essential element within a nutrient compound needs to be found, and the atomic weight of these elements and a chart is helpful to solve this.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot; /&gt;

===Hoagland solution===
[[w:Hoagland solution]]

==Advisories==
Do not add mineral tablets (except calcium?) not made for fertilizer purposes to the nutrient solution. The nutrient solution should be clear when the system is set up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Aeroponics Tomato and Lettuce.jpg|right|200px]]
This is a relatively easy and inexpensive way to make an easy top-drip [[w:aquaponic|aquaponic]] system.
It is representative of a hybrid [[w:bubbleponics|bubbleponics]] and aquaponics system.

==Materials==
[[File:Leca pellets.jpg|100px|right]]
[[File:Led lamp.jpg|100px|right]]
All component materials should be nonhazardous/noncancerous. For tools see: [[Hydroculture/DIY#Common tools|hydroculture DIY tools]]
* tote (or a 5 gallon bucket) with lid
* air pump, and tubing
* micro-tubing connectors
* basic [[w:timer|timer]] with output plugin (enough to turn on for at least a few minutes 3 times a day)
* substrates: [[w:Hydroponics#Substrates|expanded clay, parboiled rice husks]] (I'm uncertain if growstones being of glass material are safe for aquarium animals) 
* net-pots
* [[w:Lumen (unit)|high lumen output]] [[w:light bulb (disambiguation)|light bulb]]: [[w:LED lamp|led]] (lamp or candelabra type may be practical)

==Plant and symbiotic animal life==
[[file:Pomacea bridgesii MdE 1.jpg|100px|right]]
* [[w:Plant propagation|seeds, bulbs, stem cuttings]]
** chemical [[w:Hoagland solution|fertilizer]] (Apply 1 teaspoon for the whole system one time only, and this may not be necessary)
* hardy freshwater aquarium animals: [[w:goldfish|goldfish]], [[w:Loricariidae|catfish algae eater]], [[w:Freshwater mollusc|snails]] or [[w:Freshwater shrimp|shrimp]]
** algae wafers, and flakes

==Lid==
Place net-pots upside-down on the tote-lid, and leave 1 inch in diameter in the center vacant for the pex tube to come through.
Mark the outline and the center of the tote with a pencil.
Use a marker to mark about 1/4in inside the circle. (The lip of the net-pot must rest on the lid)
Use a (hand or power) drill, that is the same outer diameter as the pex pipe, to make a hole in the center of the lid.
Cut holes out for the net-pots. (As mentioned before, make sure the hole is smaller than the outer diameter of the net-pot, so the net-pot won't fall through.)

==Airlift pump==
[[File:Airliftpump1.PNG|thumb|Air-lift pump]]
The benefits using an air-pump is: that it is convenient to buy, that it is not allowed to be underwater causing an electrical hazard and that not a lot of water pressure is required in this system.
The aquarium pump will sit higher than and outside the aquaponics unit, and it will serve the function of an [[w:airlift pump|airlift pump]].

An airlift can be made with microtubing and a T connector.
First, connect the middle part of the T to the air supply in. Then, connect a short length of microtubing to one end of the T, and the fountain out to the opposite end. A micro barb coupling can be inserted on the fountain end of the microtubing to allow a narrow opening to make the water sputter further. This can also be used to connect the fountain end of the microtubing to the top of the tote lid.

The water input should be lower than the air input, and a weight may be necessary. If done properly, once the tote is filled with water, the air will push the water up to spill on the top of the tote-lid.

==Timer==
The timer only needs to be on to run the air pump enough to wet the substrate material, and needs to turn on a few times a day, at minimum for plant health.
This eliminates the need for buying an expensive timer (required for a true aeroponic system), or having to build your own through dc circuitry.
The substrate material does enough to keep the plant's roots moist between waterings.
However, the timer should turn on often, or be left on without the timer, to aerate the fish and the tank and for improved plant growth. (a mechanical timer with settings for 30 or 15 minutes on/off will work)
Plants need about 6 hours a day of darkness.
Water falling back towards the tote aerates the water.
Hook the timer to both the led (or fluorescent) light and air pump. Choose a bright light, and put the system near a window.
(Its ok to have both turn on at the same time, allow the timer to turn on less often at night)

==Final steps==
[[File:Comet Goldfish With Fry.JPG|right|200px]]
Wipe down inside of tote, cleaning up fragments.
Add water and fertilizer solution (see above) to the tote.
Use de-chlorinated water or let system run for a few minutes beforehand to de-chlorinate. Chlorine dissipates on contact with air, and chloramine takes longer to dissipate.
Set in lid and net-pots. 1 net pot can be left out to let light in for the fish, but not too much light should be let in, for plant root health.
Fill the net-pots halfway with substrate material. Add bulbs, stem cuttings or seeds. (Don't use plants dangerous to fish).
Let plant stems grow before adding the rest of the material.
Rockwool is not aerated enough, so it is ideal for balling around small seeds or layering around a stem cutting.
Most material needs to be a porous.
Coco-peat helps prevent fungus formation.
Add goldfish, and feed them daily. Goldfish seem to graze on algae. Algae eaters, shrimp and snails are optional for cleaning up algae.
The fish in this type of aquaponic system are hardier than plants.
Once the fish are established they do the work of keeping the fertilizer level stable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Peperoncini.bhut.jolokia.idroponica.jpg|right|200px]]
Here are common tools, instructions, and observations for hydroculture gardening.
==Common tools==
[[File:Adjustable hole saw.JPG|right|100px]]
[[File:Rohrabschneider 01 KMJ.jpg|right|100px]]
* drill bit
* hole saw with guide drill (short guide drills can easily slip, while using a hole-saw)
* cutting utensil: gardening clippers (with proper care and measurement could also be used in place of a hole-saw)
* drill
** hex bit screwdriver: fits on end of drill bit or hole-saw to function as a hand-drill (impractical for use with large diameter hole-saws)
** or electric (not recommended with adjustable hole saws)
* pipe cutter
* pvc primer and cement

==Water tight seals==
[[File:Oring gr.jpg|right|100px]]
* '''Materials''': 2 o-rings; 2 threaded pvc or metallic connectors
Put one o-ring on the male connection, place through hole in plastic material. Then add another o-ring, and screw on the female connector. Corresponding components must be of the same size. Connection must be snug. Check for drips.

Threaded fittings with o-rings can reduce or eliminate the need for pipe cement. If the desired threaded fitting is not available in pvc form, galvanized or brass fittings will connect to pvc fittings. Any metallic connector should be non-lead.

===Commonly used method===
Pipe thread, or pvc primer and cement.

==Adding containers==
Adding a second plastic container. Obviously both containers are to be at about the same level. Run a tube with required o-rings and threaded connectors between totes. Place halfway between bottom and water level, in case of a failure, not all of the water will drain out. Make sure this setup is watertight and ready before adding fish or plant setups. Water will transfer passively. A second air pump connection and an aeration stone is required in this setup.

===Connecting two aquatic containers together===
This is a fancy setup for fish room and for fish to travel between containers. For this to work, the containers must be sturdy. If this aquaponics system is in a permanent spot, two cylindrical bins can possibly be connected together, side by side.
Use 3&quot; or wider diameter threaded coupling, four o-rings and two more threaded connectors. This setup must be watertight and safe from damage. Again, make the connections halfway from the bottom, in case of a leakage or damage failure.

==Electrical==
Having separate timers for pumps, water pumps, and lighting.

Running DC made components on solar power.

Constructing a dc voltage timer in place of an expensive specific interval timer.

===Tweaks===
Add a second tote solely for the fish. (leave the lid off of this tote). Obviously both containers are to be at the same level. Run a tube with required o-rings and threaded connectors between totes. Place halfway between bottom and water level, in case of a failure, not all of the water will drain out. Make sure this setup is watertight and ready before adding fish. Water will transfer passively. A second air pump and a aeration stone is required in this setup.

To make this system even fancier, have a pipe with a diameter enough for fish to travel between both totes.

Alternatively like in typical aquaponic systems, use a pump to periodically transfer water between totes.

Other tweaks include: having separate timers for the air-lift pumps, water pumps, and lighting. Running DC made components on solar power is another tweak.</text>

A bottle or jar filled halfway with a combination of substrate material will function as a passive hydroponic system. In this setup, a [[w:bottle garden|bottle garden]] can serve the purpose of a passive hydroponic system. Certain combinations of substrates (expanded clay pellets, growstones, soilless mix, parboiled rice hulls) will wick water above water-level while maintaining aeration. Too much water retaining material (such as rockwool, cloth, or a sponge) will promote root rot, while other materials (expanded clay rocks, parboiled rice hulls, synthetic fibers) alone may not wick water high enough. It is important that most of the roots stay above water-level, unless this plant is semi-aquatic. Paint (use nontoxic) the bottom half of the container to reduce light around the plant's root-zone.

For a passive hydroponic garden, a bottle works better as it allows water to condense, keeping roots moist. Porous aggregate and condensation are enough to water plants' roots, so no further wicking material is needed in a passive hydroponic bottle garden. Unless this is a glass container, a valve drain may help rid of excess salts. When necessary, drain the water, partially at a time, by placing this valve halfway between the substrate level and the bottom of the container.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Parkinson's diease? ==

Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder that affects the neural cells and makes body movements difficult. Typically, these cells produce a chemical known as dopamine. Dopamine allows for the smooth, coordinated movement of the body's muscles. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease will appear when roughly 70% of these neural cells are damaged.

== Symptoms ==

There are various symptoms that may occur, although different symptoms will appear for each individual. The main symptom that is identified with Parkinson’s is a tremor or shaking of the limbs, this usually starts in one hand and moves down to the legs. It is interesting to note that one third of Parkinson’s patients will not experience these tremors. Other symptoms include:

* Rigidity or stiffness of the muscles (will feel like the muscles, even when relaxed, are tight)
* Slowness in movement (results in a reduction of fine motor control and periods of immobilization)
* Pain in arms or legs
* Cognitive and memory problems
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Disturbed sleep
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation Constipation]

== How can exercise help? ==

Exercise in Parkinson’s patients, will stimulate the synthesis of dopamine in the non-damaged cells and therefore reduce the symptoms associated with the disease. It is suggested that there are five key points to enhance positive affects on Parkinson's symptoms: 

# 	Intensive activity will maximize synaptic plasticity
# 	Complex exercises will enhance structural developments
# 	If the patient feels rewarded, dopamine will increase even more
# 	Dopaminergic cells are highly responsive to exercise
#	Progression of the disease can be decreased (slower rates if caught and started earlier)

== Recommendations ==

The studies that have been conducted have shown many different exercise duration's and frequencies in their interventions. Typically research has found that exercise programs for people with Parkinson's disease span over 4-12 weeks. The type of exercise that works best for the patient depends on their symptoms, fitness level and overall health. Generally, exercises that promote the stretching of the limbs through the full range of motion are encouraged. Some tips that people with Parkinson's are encouraged to follow are:
* Warm-up before beginning exercise and cooling down at the end
* If for example, the person plans to workout for 30 minutes, they should start with 10-minute sessions and work their way up
* Exercise facial muscles, jaw, and voice when possible: Sing or read aloud, exaggerating the lip movements, make faces in the mirror, chew food vigorously etc.
* Water exercises such as swimming and aerobics are helpful as they are easier on the joints and require less balance
* The person should always exercise with a partner or supervisor

== Treatment ==

Parkinson's disease is incurable, however drug therapy can be used to reduce the progression of the disease and reduce the nature and severity of the symptoms.The drugs used will supplement or help with the production of more dopamine. Unfortunately, long term use of these drugs will cause side-effects that can affect the patient even more so than the disease itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In grammar, parallelism is a balance of two or more similar words, phrases, or clauses. The application of parallelism in sentence construction can sometimes improve writing style, clearness, and readability. 

&quot;I went to the store, I went to the mall and I went to bed&quot; can be reduced to &quot;I went to the store, to the mall, and to bed&quot; through a parallel construction with &quot;I went&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In English, there are three contexts for conditional sentences. 

The first context involves the possible outcome of an event that is likely to occur:

:If + Present Simple/Present Progressive + Present Simple/Present Progressive/Future Simple/Future Progressive/Imperative
:*''If + I miss the bus, + I will be late for school''

The second context involves the possible outcome of an event that is less likely to occur; various sentence structures are possible for this context:

:If + Present Perfect/Present Perfect Progressive/Preterite/Past Continuous + Full Infinitive + Conditional Present/Conditional Present Progressive
:*''If + I was + to miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

:In some dialects: If + Imperfect Subjunctive + Full Infinitive + Conditional Present/Conditional Present Progressive
:*''If + I were + to miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

:In some dialects: If + modal auxiliary &quot;should&quot; + Bare Infinitive + Conditional Present/Conditional Present Progressive
:*''If + I should + miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

:The latter two formulations, with the imperfect subjunctive or the modal construction, can be modified to use subject-verb inversion instead of the conjunction ''if'':
:*''Were I + to miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''
:*''Should + I miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

The third context involves the hypothetical outcome of an event that did not occur:

:If + Pluperfect/Pluperfect Progressive + Conditional/Conditional Progressive/Conditional Perfect/Conditional Perfect Progressive
:*''If + I had missed the bus, + I would have been late for school.''

:Here too the conjunction ''if'' can be replaced by subject-verb inversion:
:*''Had I missed the bus, + I would have been late for school.''

In each formulation it is possible to reverse the order of the clauses; however, the protasis must always follow the word &quot;if&quot; or exhibit subject-verb inversion:
:*''If + I miss the bus, + I will be late for school'' can be adjusted to ''I will be late for school + if + I miss the bus.''
:*''Should + I miss the bus, + I will be late for school'' can be adjusted to ''I will be late for school + should + I miss the bus.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perfect use of grammar is never easy in the English language. The English language prides itself on its versatility and adaptability. Unlike other languages, there is no governing body that officially sets the rules of English grammar. Although there are certainly conventions that if deviated from will make your writing seem amateurish. The good thing is that many people make the same mistakes. Habitually so. In this sense, it's easy to anticipate some of these common offenses by knowing how to identify them.

The Hellenistic period or Hellenistic era of history is the period which followed the conquests and death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. The Hellenistic period may be seen to end either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BC or with the final defeat of the last remaining successor-state to Alexander's empire after the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a wave of colonists who established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa.

It was so named by the historian J. G. Droysen. During this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its zenith in Europe and Asia. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decline or decadence, between the brilliance of the Greek Classical era and the emergence of the Roman Empire.

There many different network topologies.Mesh network is widely used. Mesh networking is a topology where each node must not only capture and disseminate its own data, but also serve as a relay for other nodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Point-to-point&lt;/ref&gt;
The network is redundant and fault tolerant. This makes it so that if one node goes &lt;br /&gt;
down it does not take the whole network with it. &lt;br /&gt;
This gives it self-healing capabilities. The network will change the route of the packets to a node that is still up and working. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Some of the advantages are as follows: Point to point line configuration makes identification and isolation of faults easy, messages travel through a dedicated line meaning that only the intended recipient receives the message, in the case of a fault in one link, only the communication between the two devices sharing the link is affected, and the use of dedicated links ensures that each connection carries its own data load thus eliminating traffic problems that would have been encountered if a connection/link was shared. Mesh networks are best for WAN, MAN and large LANs. For the average house hold this network is not recommend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meshdynamics.com/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This is because the network will grow larger and expensive to maintain. The networks best for home use would be Star, Ad hoc, or bus. Ad hoc networks are a form of mesh network with the only difference being that every node connects directly to each other and not through a switch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hellenistic philosophy==

Usually, Hellenistic philosophy is described as the period of Western philosophy that developed in the Hellenistic civilization following Aristotle and ending with the beginning of Neoplatonism.

===Hellenistic schools of thought===

====Pythagoreanism and Neopythagoreanism====
'''Pythagoras'''

Pythagoreanism was the system of esoteric and metaphysical beliefs held by Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras of Samos (c.570 – c.495 BCE) and his followers, the Pythagorean cult. Pythagoras (c. 570 BCE-495 BCE) was an early Greek philosopher, mathematician and the founder of a religion called Pythagoreanism. He is famous for his eponymous theorem about right triangles: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (a and b) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (c). Little reliable information remains about the life of Pythagoras, to the point that historians some historians attribute some of &quot;his&quot; thoughts to his followers. Whether they were the ideas of the man or a school of thought, the ideals influenced many Greek philosophers (a word said to have been coined by Pythagoras, Greek for a &quot;lover of wisdom&quot;) including Plato. 

Pythagorean thought was dominated by mathematics, and it was profoundly mystical. Pythagorean triangle---and its uses in problem solving]] Pythagoreanism emphasized a belief in mathematics and that numbers are the ultimate philosophical truth. The Pythagoreans are known for their theory of the transmigration of souls, and also for their theory that numbers constitute the true nature of things. They performed purification rites and followed and developed various rules of living which they believed would enable their souls to achieve a higher rank among the gods. Arguably, Pythagoras' most important contribution to society was the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in any right triangle ABC, where &quot;C&quot; is the hypotenuse, A^2+B^2=C^2. 

Two schools of Pythagorean thought eventually developed, one based largely on mathematics and continuing his line of scientific work(the ''mathēmatikoi'' or &quot;learners&quot;); the other focusing on his more esoteric teachings (the ''akousmatikoi'' or &quot;listeners&quot;), though each shared a part of the other.

Its two main representatives are:

* Pythagoras (570-495 BCE), creator of the Pythagorean theorem, and
* Hippasus (5th century BCE), who is traditionally credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers.

Neopythagoreanism was a school of philosophy reviving Pythagorean doctrines, which was prominent in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. It was an attempt to introduce a religious element into Greek philosophy, worshiping God by living an ascetic life, ignoring bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses, to purify the soul.

Its main representatives were:

* Nigidius Figulus (98-45 BCE), who incorporated Stoic elements to esoteric Pythagoreanism,to create Neopythagoreanism.
* Numenius of Apamea (2nd century CE), a forerunner of the Neoplatonists.

====Epicureanism====
Epicurus (341 BCE – 270 BCE) was a materialist philosopher, in the sense that Epicurus placed emphasis on only the tangible things of the Earth. For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia—peace and freedom from fear—and aponia—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends, enjoying the simple joys of life instead of pursuing wealth, fame or power. Many of his thoughts were groundbreaking for the time. He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods do not reward or punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space.

Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BCE. It viewed the universe as being ruled by chance, with no interference from gods. It regarded absence of pain as the greatest pleasure, and advocated a simple life. It was the main rival to Stoicism until both philosophies died out in the 3rd century CE.

Its main representatives were:

* Epicurus (341-270 BCE). For the founder of Epicurianism, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by peace and freedom from fear by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends.
* Zeno of Sidon (1st century BCE), who held that happiness is not merely dependent upon present enjoyment and prosperity, but also on a reasonable expectation of their continuance and appreciation.

====Cynicism====
[[File:Anisthenes Pio-Clementino Inv288.jpg|thumb|Portrait bust of Antisthenes, Museo Pio-Clementino.]]

The Cynics were an ascetic sect of philosophers beginning with Antisthenes in the 4th century BCE and continuing until the 5th century CE. Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, sex, and fame, and by living a simple life free from all possessions. As reasoning creatures, people could gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.

Its main representatives were:

* Antisthenes (445-365 BCE), the founder of Cynic philosophy; and
* Demetrius (10-80 CE) who wrote: &quot;An easy existence, untroubled by the attacks of Fortune is a Dead Sea.&quot;

====Cyrenaicism====

The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BCE, supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene, although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger. The school was so called after the Greek city of Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from altruistic behaviour. The school died out within a century and was replaced by the philosophy of Epicureanism.

Its main representative was:

* Aristippus of Cyrene (435-360 BCE)

====Platonism and Neoplatonism====
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato: copy of portrait bust by Silanion, Musei Capitolini.]]

Platonism is the philosophy of Classical Greek philosopher Plato (424/423 BCE – 348/347 BCE) which was maintained and developed by his followers. The central concept of Platonism is the distinction between that reality which is perceptible, but not intelligible, and that which is intelligible, but imperceptible; to this distinction the Theory of Forms is essential. The forms are typically described in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'' and ''Republic'' as transcendent, perfect archetypes, of which objects in the everyday world are imperfect copies. In the ''Republic'', the highest form is identified as the Form of the Good, the source of all other forms, which could be known by reason. In the Sophist, a later work, the forms being, sameness and difference are listed among the primordial &quot;Great Kinds&quot;. In the 3rd century BCE, Arcesilaus adopted skepticism, which became a central tenet of the school until 90 BCE when Antiochus added Stoic elements, rejected skepticism, and began a period known as Middle Platonism. In the 3rd century CE, Plotinus added mystical elements, establishing Neoplatonism, in which the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things; in virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One. Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought, and many Platonic notions were adopted by the Christian church which understood Platonic forms as God's thoughts.

Its main representatives were:

* Plato (424/423–348/347 BCE), writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Along with his mentor, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle, Plato helped to lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science.
* Speusippus (407-339 BCE)successor to Plato as head of the Academy.
* Xenocrates (396-314 BCE), who taught that virtue produces happiness, but that external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose.
* Antiochus of Ascalon (130-68 BCE) generator of the phase of philosophy known as Middle Platonism.
* Plutarch (46-120 CE), author of ''Parallel Lives'' and ''Moralia''.



Neoplatonism, or Plotinism, was a school of religious and mystical philosophy founded by Plotinus in the 3rd century CE and based on the teachings of Plato and the other Platonists. Neoplatonism focused on the spiritual and cosmological aspects of Platonic thought, synthesizing Platonism with Egyptian and Jewish theology. They believed that the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things. In virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One, the true function of human beings. It was the main rival to Christianity until dying out in the 6th century.

Its main representatives were:

* Plotinus (205-270 CE), who taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent &quot;One&quot;, containing no division, multiplicity or distinction; beyond all categories of being and non-being.
* Porphyry (233-309 CE), who wrote ''Isagoge,'' an introduction to logic and philosophy, that became the standard textbook on logic throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hellenistic Philosophy&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peripateticism====

The Peripatetics was the name given to the philosophers who maintained and developed the philosophy of Aristotle (384-322 BCE).  They advocated examination of the world to understand the ultimate foundation of things. The goal of life was the happiness which originated from virtuous actions, which consisted in keeping the mean between the two extremes of the too much and the too little.

Its main representatives were:

* Aristotle (384-322 BCE). His writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality, aesthetics, logic, science, politics, and metaphysics.
* Strato of Lampsacus (335-269 BCE), who increased the naturalistic elements in Aristotle's thought to such an extent, that he denied the need for an active god to construct the universe, preferring to place the government of the universe in the unconscious force of nature alone.

====Pyrrhonian skepticism====

Pyrrhonian skepticism, was a school of skepticism beginning with philosopher Pyrrho in the 3rd century BCE, and further advanced by Aenesidemus in the 1st century BCE. It advocated total philosophical skepticism about the world in order to attain ''ataraxia'' or a tranquil mind, maintaining that nothing could be proved to be true so we must suspend judgement.

* Pyrrho (365-275 BCE). His theory of the impossibility of knowledge (The impossibility of knowledge, even in regard to our own ignorance or doubt, should induce the wise person to withdraw into themselves) is the first and the most thorough exposition of noncognitivism in the history of thought.
* Timon (320-230 BCE)
* Aenesidemus (1st century BCE)
* Sextus Empiricus (2nd century CE)

====Stoicism====

Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE. Based on the ethical ideas of the Cynics, it taught that the goal of life was to live in accordance with Nature. It advocated the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. It was the most successful school of philosophy until it died out in the 3rd century CE.

Its main representatives were:

* Zeno of Citium (333-263 BCE) believed that goodness and peace of mind could be gained from living a life of virtue in accordance with nature.
* Seneca (4 BCE-65 CE), Roman philosopher, statesman, and dramatist.
* Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE), Roman Emperor and author of the ''Meditations'', a literary monument to a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration.

==Hellenistic sciences==

The military campaigns of Alexander the Great spread Greek thought to Egypt, Asia Minor, Persia, up to the Indus River. The resulting Hellenistic civilization produced seats of learning in Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria along with Greek speaking populations across several monarchies. Hellenistic science differed from Greek science in at least two ways: first, it benefited from the cross-fertilization of Greek ideas with those that had developed in the larger Hellenistic world; secondly, to some extent, it was supported by royal patrons in the kingdoms founded by Alexander's successors. 

Especially important to Hellenistic science was the city of Alexandria in Egypt, which became a major center of scientific research in the 3rd century BCE. Two institutions established there during the reigns of Ptolemy I Soter (reigned 323 - 283 BCE) and Ptolemy II Philadelphus (reigned 281 - 246 BCE) were the Library and the Museum. Unlike Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, these institutions were officially supported by the Ptolemies; although the extent of patronage could be precarious, depending on the policies of the current ruler.

Hellenistic scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.

In medicine, Herophilos (335 - 280 BCE) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the nervous system.
[[File:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|The Antikythera mechanism.]]

Geometers such as Archimedes (ca. 287 BCE – 212 BCE), Apollonius of Perga (ca. 262 BCE – ca. 190 BCE), and Euclid (ca. 325 BCE – 265 BCE), whose Elements became the most important textbook in mathematics until the 19th century, built upon the work of the Hellenic era Pythagoreans. Eratosthenes used his knowledge of geometry to measure the distance between the Sun and the Earth along with the size of the Earth.

Astronomers like Hipparchus (ca. 190 – ca. 120 BCE) built upon the measurements of the Babylonian astronomers before him, to measure the precession of the Earth. Pliny reports that Hipparchus produced the first systematic star catalog after he observed a new star (it is uncertain whether this was a nova or a comet) and wished to preserve astronomical record of the stars, so that other new stars could be discovered. It has recently been claimed that a celestial globe based on Hipparchus's star catalog sits atop the broad shoulders of a large 2nd-century Roman statue known as the Farnese Atlas.

The level of Hellenistic achievement in astronomy and engineering is impressively shown by the Antikythera mechanism (150-100 BCE). It is a 37-gear mechanical computer which computed the motions of the Sun and Moon, including lunar and solar eclipses predicted on the basis of astronomical periods believed to have been learned from the Babylonians. Devices of this sort are not found again until the 10th century, when a simpler eight-geared luni-solar calculator incorporated into an astrolabe was described by the Persian scholar, Al-Biruni. Similarly complex devices were also developed by other Muslim engineers and astronomers during the Middle Ages.

The interpretation of Hellenistic science varies widely. At one extreme is the view of the English classical scholar, Cornford, who believed that &quot;all the most important and original work was done in the three centuries from 600 to 300 BCE.&quot; At the other is the view of the Italian physicist and mathematician, Lucio Russo, who claims that scientific method was actually born in the 3rd century BCE, to be forgotten during the Roman period and only revived in the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Science in Classical Antiquity&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Hellenistic_period#Hellenistic_period&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic astronomy===

====Planetary models and observational astronomy====
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Renaissance woodcut illustrating the two-sphere model.]]

In classical Greece, astronomy was a branch of mathematics; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. The Eudoxan system used a two-sphere geocentric model, which divided the cosmos into two regions:

* A spherical Earth, central and motionless (the sublunary sphere).
* A spherical heavenly realm centered on the Earth, which may contain multiple rotating spheres made of aether

However, the Eudoxan system had several critical flaws. One was its inability to predict motions exactly. Callippus, a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, attempt to correct this flaw by adding seven spheres to Eudoxus' original 27. But, some flaws persisted: the inability of his models to explain why planets appear to change speed; and its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by Autolycus of Pitane (c. 310 BCE).

Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 BCE–c. 190 BCE) responded by introducing two new mechanisms that allowed a planet to vary its distance and speed: the eccentric deferent and the deferent and epicycle. The deferent is a circle carrying the planet around the Earth. (The word deferent comes from the Latin ferro, ferre, meaning &quot;to carry.&quot;) An eccentric deferent is slightly off-center from Earth. In a deferent and epicycle model, the deferent carries a small circle, the epicycle, which carries the planet. The deferent-and-epicycle model can mimic the eccentric model, as shown by Apollonius' theorem. It can also explain retrogradation, which happens when planets appear to reverse their motion through the zodiac for a short time. Modern historians of astronomy have determined that Eudoxus' models could only have approximated retrogradation crudely for some planets, and not at all for others.

In the 2nd century BCE, Hipparchus, aware of the extraordinary accuracy with which Babylonian astronomers could predict the planets' motions, insisted that Greek astronomers achieve similar levels of accuracy. Somehow he had access to Babylonian observations or predictions, and used them to create better geometrical models. For the Sun, he used a simple eccentric model, based on observations of the equinoxes, which explained both changes in the speed of the Sun and differences in the lengths of the seasons. For the Moon, he used a deferent and epicycle model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.

Hipparchus also compiled a star catalogue. According to Pliny the Elder, he observed a nova (new star). So that later generations could tell whether other stars came to be, perished, moved, or changed in brightness, he recorded the position and brightness of the stars. Ptolemy mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' discovery of precession. (Precession of the equinoxes is a slow motion of the place of the equinoxes through the zodiac, caused by the shifting of the Earth's axis). Hipparchus thought it was caused by the motion of the sphere of fixed stars.

====Heliocentrism and cosmic scales====

In the 3rd century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos proposed an alternate cosmology (arrangement of the universe): a heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe (hence he is sometimes known as the &quot;Greek Copernicus&quot;). His astronomical ideas were not well-received, however, and only a few brief references to them are preserved. We know the name of one follower of Aristarchus: Seleucus of Seleucia.

Aristarchus also wrote a book On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, which is his only work to have survived. In this work, he calculated the sizes of the Sun and Moon, as well as their distances from the Earth in Earth radii. Shortly afterwards, Eratosthenes calculated the size of the Earth, providing a value for the Earth radii which could be plugged into Aristarchus' calculations. Hipparchus wrote another book On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, which has not survived. Both Aristarchus and Hipparchus drastically underestimated the distance of the Sun from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek astronomy&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_astronomy#Hellenistic_astronomy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic mathematics===

During the Hellenistic period, Greek mathematics merged with Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics to give rise to a Hellenistic mathematics.

Even though,  mathematical texts written in Greek have been found in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Sicily, Alexandria in Egypt, which attracted mathematics scholars from across the Hellenistic world, mostly Greek and Egyptian, but also Jewish, Persian, Phoenician and even Indian scholars.

Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BCE – c. 212 BCE) became one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. He was able to use infinitesimals in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus. Using a technique dependent on a form of proof by contradiction he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π (Pi). In The Quadrature of the Parabola, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 times the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He expressed the solution to the problem as an infinite geometric series, whose sum was 4/3. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted, devising his own counting scheme based on the myriad, which denoted 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek Mathematics&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics#Hellenistic&lt;/ref&gt;

=The Economics of Young Democracies:Policies and Performance=
By Nathan Converse and Ethan B. Kapstein, Center for Global Development Working Paper, March 2006

==Introduction==

The second half of the twentieth century may eventually become known as the “age of democracy.” Since the “third wave” of democratization began in 1974, nearly 100 states have adopted democratic forms of government, including, of course, most of the former Soviet bloc nations (Huntington 1991). America policy-makers have expressed the hope that this democratic wave will extend even further, to the Middle East and onward, perhaps reaching China’s shores in the not-too-distant future (“Rice Plans to Encourage Democratization,” 11 October 2005, www.state.gov).

Why do policy-makers care about advancing the cause of democracy? Beyond its contributions to civil liberties and international peace, democratic governance is increasingly seen as being necessary to the achievement of sustained economic development and a better standard of living (Bardhan 1999; Diamond 2005; Halperin, Siegle, and Weinstein 2005). According to Larry Diamond, “a high quality democracy…will be used to generate public goods that stimulate investment and commerce and raise the quality of life” (Diamond 2005). And in a recently published study, Halperin, Siegle and Weinstein claim that, “democracies generally experience more rapid and consistent improvements in the well being of their populations than do autocracies” (Halperin, Siegle and Weinstein 2005, 65).

On the basis of such claims, these and other scholars have advanced the policy recommendation that democratization must play a central role, and perhaps the central role—in both domestic policies and foreign assistance programs that seek to promote sustained economic growth among other objectives. In fact, it appears as if policy-makers have heeded that advice, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeatedly emphasizing the need to promote democracy and only mentioning poverty relief in passing in her speech announcing the creation of a new Director of Foreign Assistance position in her Department (“Remarks At the U.S. Agency for International Development On Foreign Assistance,” 19 January 2006, www.state.gov). Likewise, the new foreign aid program of the United States, the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), provides funds only to those countries that “rule justly,” and it is plausible that the World Bank under the leadership of Paul Wolfowitz will also move in that direction, tying development assistance to democracy-building more directly. Understanding therelationship between democracy and development therefore goes well beyond an “academic exercise.”
Despite the west’s political commitment to support democratization, the durability of the new democratic age remains an open question. By some accounts, at least half of the world’s youngest democracies—often referred to in the academic literature as being “unconsolidated” or “fragile”—are still struggling to develop their political institutions, and several have reverted back to authoritarian rule. Among the countries in the early stages of democratic institution building are states vital to U.S. national security interests, including Afghanistan and Iraq. Ensuring that the developing world’s democracies survive and prosper is therefore a crucial policy challenge.
The ability of fledgling democracies to maintain popular support depends, at least to some extent, on the ability of their governments to deliver economic policies that meet with widespread approval. But what sorts of economic policies are these, and are they necessarily the same as the policies required for tackling difficult issues of economic stabilization and reform? Conversely, what sorts of economic policies are most likely to spark a backlash against young and fragile democratic regimes? Do the leaders of young democracies face trade-offs as they ponder their electoral and economic strategies?

These are among the questions we explore in this paper, which aims to provide an overview of the monograph we are currently writing on the economics of young democracies. As already noted, we believe these issues assume significant policy relevance in light of recent U.S. (among other bilateral and multilateral) foreign aid initiatives explicitly aimed at promoting democratic consolidation. Evidence that economic performance significantly affects the probability of democratic survival in a given country renders the question of how well the new democracies manage their economies all the more pressing from a policy-making standpoint. Adam Przeworski and colleagues, for example, have found the probability that a young democracy will be overthrown grows ten-fold when the economy contracts two years in a row (Przeworski, et al., 2000:109). The idea that poor economic performance poses a threat to democracy has been supported by a great deal of quantitative work. In an oft-cited study, Rueschemyer, Stephens, and Stephens (1992) demonstrate that economic factors played a decisive role in nearly all the democratic reversals in Latin America between 1920 and 1980. Evidence from opinion surveys also shows that public support for democracy has frayed when economic conditions deteriorate (Haggard and Kaufman 1995).

This paper examines much of what we know about the theory and empirics of economic policy and performance in the consolidation and reversal of newly democratic states. The paper is in four sections. First, by way of background, we examine the hypothesized relationships between democratic politics and economic policy-making. Second, we analyze the findings of several important empirical studies with respect to the economic performance of young democracies around the world. In the third section, we provide some descriptive statistics which indicate how young democracies have fared and are faring in practice, making use of the new dataset that we have compiled (which, among other things, is more up-to-date than the others cited herein). We are particularly interested in comparing the economic performance of those young democracies that successfully consolidate as opposed to those that ultimately fail. Do the data reveal any distinctive economic patterns with respect to democratic consolidation and reversal? We will show that they do. In particular, we find that deteriorating or stagnant economic performance constitutes a red flag or warning signal that the country is at risk of democratic reversal. Moreover, we observe considerable variation in economic performance, suggesting that the design of political institutions in new democracies may have a significant influence on the probability of their survival. The fourth section provides our conclusions and policy recommendations, while a discussion of our dataset and some summary tables are found in the appendices.

===I. The Political Economy of Democracy===

In recent years a growing number of scholars and policy-makers have expressed optimism that democracy and development are mutually reinforcing. In the spring of 2005, for instance, Larry Diamond told an audience in Ghana, “Africa cannot develop without democracy” and asserted that the literature points “clearly” to “a causal effect of democracy on economic growth….” As a consequence, he urged his listeners to shun any thoughts of authoritarian solutions to their economic problems. He suggested that the East Asian miracle, for example, “took place in a historic and regional context that is unlikely to be repeated,” and that it therefore failed to provide a relevant developmental model for contemporary political leaders (Diamond 2005).
What are the channels through which democracy (our definition and list of country cases are found in the appendices) influences economic development? The literature posits several channels or pathways by which politics influences economics that we explore in this section:

First, democracy may influence economic policy through the channels provided by the electoral process;

Second, that influence may be felt through the channels provided by political parties that serve to aggregate voter interests;

Third, economic policy may be shaped through the channels provided by the institutional structure—e.g. presidential vs. parliamentary—that a particular democracy adopts;

Fourth, the age of a democratic regime may influence economic performance, since democratic institutions may take time to develop and mature.

Overall, these inter-locking attributes of a democracy—its electoral system (who gets to vote and which offices are contested), its political parties (how many, which interests are aggregated, and how well they are organized), its institutions (what type), and its age (how long these have been in place)—define its “constitutional political economy.” Indeed, we should emphasize that while many cross-country studies of democracy and economic performance define democracies at the most aggregate or abstract level, the variance among democracies along these four attributes may be of great significance for economic outcomes. In short, the type of democracy may matter no less than democracy itself in terms of delivering sustainedeconomic growth.

===Voters, Elections and Economic Policy===

Competitive elections play a key role in all mature democracies, and central to democratic electoral theory is the presence of a median voter, or “swing voter” whose support is required if a politician is to be elected to office (Downs 1957). By definition, the median voter, who occupies the fifth and sixth income deciles, owns less capital than the average for the nation as a whole, or to put this in the starkest terms we might say that the median voter is poorer than the average voter. This fact is consequential for economic policy and performance, for it suggests that the median voter, whose political support is decisive in contested elections, will demand income redistribution from the rich from her representatives as the price of her support.

Indeed, the demand for income redistribution is at the heart of contemporary political-economy accounts of political regime change, specifically the shift from authoritarian to democratic regimes (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). In Acemoglu and Robinson (2006),democracy is modeled as a game-theoretic solution to interactions between rich and poor, in that it provides credible, limited redistribution to the poor through the franchise while preserving the property rights of the rich. One empirical problem with this argument, however, is that we do not observe such redistribution in practice, particularly in the world’s young democracies.

Returning to the world of theory, scholars have argued that since the median voter has a powerful incentive to demand redistribution, those with wealth in a democracy will have less incentive to save and to invest, and they may even decide to take their capital to friendlier locales, leaving the country poorer. One frequently posited outcome of this interaction between rich and poor is that democracies inevitably emphasize short-run consumption at the expense of long-run investment, with the result that a country’s growth potential goes unfulfilled (Huntington 1968; Rao 1984). In short, the economic policies of democracies are redistributive toward the median voter and growth is negatively affected as a consequence. One might expect these pressures to be particularly acute in developing countries where the gap between the median voter and those in the upper income deciles in likely to be enormous, and where the median voter may even be lacking in some of the basic necessities of life. This is a claim made by Haggard and Kaufman (1995) for example, and we will return to it below in our discussion of age of democracy.

The electoral influence on economic policy does not simply lead to income redistribution toward the median voter, but it has widespread macroeconomic effects as well. In the process of gaining the support of voters, politicians may be tempted loosen monetary policy and avoid fiscal discipline in order to provide infrastructure and jobs. From this perspective, a balanced budget is seen as a collective good, and no politician is motivated to contribute to it. Instead, she wants other politicians to practice fiscal restraint while she provides her own constituents with both “pork” and low taxes. Since every politician thinks in the same way, the result in a democracy is high spending and low taxation, and for this reason James Buchanan famously argued that democracies will tend toward the creation of budget deficits. Democratic governments inevitably become bloated, and it follows that “a democratic society…will tend to resort to an excessive use of deficit finance…” (Buchanan and Wagner 1978).

The general tendency of democracies to adopt lax fiscal and monetary policies has been more precisely associated with the electoral process through the so-called “political business cycle” (PBC). Economists have long observed that democratically elected politicians have an incentive to stimulate the economy artificially by loosening monetary policy and abandoning fiscal rectitude during the run-up to elections, and this behavior has been formally modeled by opportunistic PBC theories (as opposed to partisan PBC theory, discussed in the next section)Early theories of the opportunistic political business cycle focused on the opportunities arising from an exploitable Phillips curve and a myopic electorate (Alesina et al. 1997: 15), suggesting that competitive elections will generate volatility in employment, inflation, and growth rates. Later work (for example, Rogoff 1990) made the questionable assumption of a myopic electorate unnecessary by positing asymmetric information regarding the incumbent’s competence. These rational opportunistic models note that while both competent and incompetent incumbents can stimulate the economy by stepping-up government spending and expanding the money supply, only the more capable policy-maker can bring about additional economic improvements using superior managerial skills. Thus, the PBC allows competent incumbents to signal their abilities to voters. While the long-run effects of political business cycles on economic performance are unclear, they presumably undermine the level of investment and hence the growth rate by introducing greater volatility into the economy. It worth noting that PBC theories implicitly assume competitive elections, in which a degree of uncertainty exists regarding the outcome—a leader who will certainly be reelected has no reason to signal his managerial competence by stimulating the economy (Block 2002: 6). By implication, a shift from a less democratic government to a more democratic government with greater contestation of public offices implies that political business cycles may be magnified in newly democratizing countries.

Academic models that emphasize the influence of the median voter on economic policy have won a prized spot in the political economy pantheon. But empirical support for the median voter hypothesis is mixed at best, and it has been queried from a theoretical perspective as well, for various reasons. For one thing, since the interests of voters tend to be multi-peaked rather than single-peaked, their ability to hold politicians accountable on particular issues may be doubted. But even in the presence of single-peaked voting, voters may be unable to induce good behavior from their politicians, particularly if the official believes she is likely to lose the next election in any case, say due to exogenous shocks (e.g. an increase in oil prices) that undermine economic growth.

More prominently, Olson famously questioned the ability of individuals to advance their material interests effectively, given the free-rider temptation in the face of collective goods provision (Olson 1965, 1982). For example, while the median voter might wish for income redistribution, she might not be bothered to go out and vote, assuming that others will perform that task and produce the desired outcome. Since individuals face severe organizational impediments due to their preference for free-riding, their political impact might not be very great after all as compared to that of organized interests. Olson suggested instead that small groupswith a shared purpose would be most successful in advancing their political and economic agenda to the extent they had a strong material interest in a particular policy outcome. And among these small, politically active interest groups, private sector business lobbies have won particular attention from scholars.

The relationship between electorally motivated politicians and rent-seeking private sector lobbyists has been summarized in a simple equation by Grossman and Helpman (2002). They argue that:

V = C + aW

Where:

V = votes,

C = campaign contributions, and

a = a parameter term that suggests the trade-off between C and aggregate welfare (W).

Thus, politicians need to win votes but their campaigns are paid for by lobbyists who make contributions in return for desired policies (e.g. tariffs, contracts, or subsidies). By kowtowing too much to the lobbyists, however, the politicians generate welfare-reducing policies that cost them the votes of everyday citizens. They must therefore strike an appropriate balance between lobbyists and voters; still, the private sector interest will be both prominent in policy-making and generally welfare-reducing from an economic standpoint (Grossman and Helpman emphasize the formation of trade policy in their own work).

Olson asserted that these lobbies can play an extremely negative role in the economic performance of nations; indeed, he assigned them a central role in the economic decline of democratic states (1982). For Olson, it was organized interest groups that prevented politicians from implementing welfare-enhancing reforms. Interestingly, whereas Olson tended to view interest group power as being weakest in young democracies, Hellman has demonstrated how organized groups effectively captured the reform process in post-Communist Russia, blocking those reforms that would have led to more openness and competition (Hellman 1998). This observation leads to a more general, empirical set of questions regarding how well organized special interest groups actually are in the world’s young democracies, how much influence they have over policy-making, and what economic policies they seek. This is an area in which much work remains to be done.

In contrast to Olson, some theorists have tried to demonstrate that democracy ameliorates a society’s distributive conflicts and as a result this type of political system is efficiency-enhancing. Rodrik (1999; 2000), for example, elaborates a model in which two interest groups with divergent policy preferences repeatedly interact to formulate policy. If the groups face uncertainty about which will have a superior bargaining position in the future, they can reach an equilibrium in which they compromise, since the costs of making concessions is offset by the future benefits of concessions by one’s opponent when that group is in power. This outcome depends not only on repeated interactions, but also on uncertainty about the groups' future ability to impose their will on their opponent. By introducing such uncertainty through competitive elections, democracy promotes compromise, reducing policy volatility and facilitating better economic performance.

Competitive elections are also expected to be efficiency-enhancing for other reasons. For example, popular discourse, as well as economic theory, has generally viewed the public sector as less efficient than the private due to a dearth of competition in the former. However, democracy has the potential to introduce competition into the public sector, albeit indirectly. Lake and Baum (2001) lay out a theoretical model in which the government is a monopoly provider of public services, and thus restricts supply to drive up price in the form of rents extracted by government officials. They view democracy as a way of rendering the market for public services &quot;contestable,&quot; with candidates for political office being potential entrants threatening to undercut the monopoly provider. In short, by introducing competitive pressures into the public sector, democracy forces the state to supply more and better public services.1

To summarize, one of the central characteristics of democracy is its reliance on competitive elections for choosing political leaders who are accountable to voters. That process has distinctive implications for economic policy, at least some of which have been held by scholars to be quite negative (Bardhan and Yang 2004). In the world’s young democracies, these negative attributes might even be accentuated as political leaders seek to shore up support and build credibility with voters (Keefer 2005). Yet it is not just through the median voter that the economic policies of democracies are shaped; these policies may also be a function of the way in which political parties and institutions aggregate contending interests. We turn to these perspectives in the following sections.

===Political Parties and Economic Policy===

There is a longstanding tradition in the political economy literature linking the political party in power with distinctive approaches to economic policy; this has been called the “partisanship school” of political economy (for reviews, see Drazen 2001 and Rueda n.d.). Briefly, the partisanship school holds that left-wing or social democratic governments will protect the interests of labor and the “working class” while right-wing or conservative governments will protect the interests of those who have accumulated capital. The distinctive economic policy approaches are allegedly made manifest in macroeconomic performance, with social democracies having higher levels of taxation, government spending, and inflation than conservative governments. A related literature modeling partisan political business cycles views the different preferences of left- and right-wing parties for unemployment and inflation as producing macroeconomic fluctuations (Alesina et al. 1997: 45).

As Rueda notes (n.d.), critical to such approaches is the assumption that political parties have “core constituencies” whose interests are paramount in setting the platform and in policy-making should the party form a government. A party’s main challenge, therefore, is to build a “winning coalition” around this core constituency. On the other hand, if the party follows solely the preferences of its core it may well lose election after election (that, of course, could be a perverse outcome of internal party politics). While the winning strategy of coalition-building may temper the more extreme strands of a given economic strategy the overall trajectory remains clear to voters, at least in contrast to that of the rival party. Thus, parties provide voters with clear choices. By “unpacking” political parties, this analysis of electoral politics allows for centrifugal forces within parties, which counteract the drive to appease the median voter, and endogenizes parties’ actual platforms.

It should further be emphasized that the partisanship approach is firmly materialistic, in that it associates core constituencies with economic classes. So far as we are aware, the partisanship school has not applied its model of party behavior to other constituencies, such as religious or ethnic groups. But such non-class-based allegiances are a distinctive feature of many new democracies, and these divisions may become the basis for competitive politics within the democratic setting. In Iraq, for example, political parties seem to be based largely on ethnic groupings, though of course within each ethnic faction one finds further political divisions that are also organized into parties. We note that the effects of these party groupings on economic policy and performance have been little studied; Haggard and Kaufman (1995), for example, rely on traditional, class-based partisanship models in their analysis of the political economy of democratic transitions. This is an area that will certainly attract more research from socialscientists in the years ahead and may lead to a very different view of the interests that political parties represent in domestic politics, and the policies they pursue once in government.

Still other theorists have emphasized that the ideological orientation of the political party in power matters less than the level of institutionalization that characterizes the parties that compete for office. In their study of the political economy of economic reform in 13 countries, Williamson and Haggard (1994) reject the idea that right-wing governments are better suited or even more likely to implement market-oriented reforms. By contrast, they find that the governments are more likely to carry out economic reforms when the party in power enjoys a broad support base. Similarly, Haggard and Kaufman stress the crucial importance of institutions that are capable of channeling conflicts over distribution and policy for the formulation of high-quality economic policy, and conclude that broad-based, cohesive political parties (or stable coalitions of parties) are particularly suited to perform this function. In contrast, they find that fragmented or polarized party systems generally fail to implement welfare-enhancing economic policies (Haggard and Kaufman 1995). We note that developing countries, including young democracies, vary enormously in terms of the degree of institutionalization of political parties and the relationship between party organizations and those who govern. One might say, in short, that what matters from an economic policy perspective is the capacity of parties to link politicians and large groups of voters in a way that enhances policy credibility.2 And that observation, in turn, leads directly to our discussion of democratic institutions and economic policy.

===Democratic Institutions and Economic Policy===

Underlying electoral processes and party structures are the basic democratic institutions established by a nation’s constitution. In discussing the implications of institutional structure for the formation of economic policies, analysts have emphasized the ways in which institutions can check the power of the state to prevent abuses, as well as examining how institutional structure influences policy outcomes. A separate literature has suggested that more abstract democratic institutions—personal freedom, an unfettered press, etc.—generate a dynamism conducive to efficiency and economic development.

Numerous theorists have focused on the way in which democracy’s institutional features positively influence economic performance by putting in place checks and balances. One check results from the fact that incumbents (or their parties) can be held accountable by the public in the next election. Whereas under autocracy, leaders may arbitrarily expropriate property for their own benefit, or government officials may demand bribes without fear of punishment, democracy generates incentives to refrain from such behavior, leading to stronger property rights, greater economic efficiency and less uncertainty (North 1990). Rodrik (1999) builds a model that produces similar results.

Moreover, the separation of powers present in most democracies introduces a further source of checks and balances. Whereas voters can only hold politicians accountable ex post,3 legislatures may block executive excesses ex ante. Particularly relevant to a discussion of economic policy is the existence of unelected institutions designed to buffer certain sets of policies from immediate domestic political pressures. Independent central banks, whose directors are often appointed for relatively long terms of office, insulate macroeconomic policy from potentially destabilizing popular demands. Supreme courts, whose members may serve for life, serve—in theory—as a further bulwark against abuses by legislatures and executives.

Analysis of institutions and their impact on economic policy have extensively explored the impact on policy of differences in the relationship between the fundamental bodies of executive and legislative authority. In particular, parliamentary democracies may be contrasted with presidential systems, in which the chief executive is elected by direct voting and given a more or less independent (from the legislature) power base and set of responsibilities. These differences could have important economic effects. Persson and Tabellini (2002) have pushed this analysis the farthest, developing a number of testable propositions that compare and contrast parliamentary and presidential regimes, viz.:

(1) “Parliamentary regimes will have larger governments than presidential regimes.”

(2) “Presidential regimes should be associated with less rent extraction and lower taxation than parliamentary regimes.”

(3) “Presidential regimes…should also be associated with more targeted programs at the expense of broad spending programs” (Persson and Tabellini 2002, 30).

The rationale for this distinction between presidential and parliamentary regimes in terms of economic policy and performance in part stems from the different checks and balances they introduce. Persson and Tabellini argue that political systems with “a larger concentration of power in parliamentary regimes makes it easier for politicians to collude with each other at the voters’ expense…” (Persson and Tabellini 2001, 4). However, others argue that parliamentary regimes are best suited to check the abusive power of the president, especially in developing countries where legislatures are often weak. As a consequence, developing countries have been urged to avoid strong, presidential models in favor of parliamentary democracy. Parliamentary systems with coalition governments have been held to be the most growth-friendly, as the various factions keep check on each other’s extreme spending tendencies; they therefore “internalize” the benefits of the separation of powers model. Overall, however, it is not clear which regime type—presidential or parliamentary—generates higher levels of long-run growth

Beyond electoral processes and formal institutional structures, other theorists point to the role of more diffuse democratic institutions in promoting market efficiency by inducing the free flow of capital, labor, or information. Early versions of this idea can be found in the work of Marx (Giddens 1971: 51), though it is most often associated with Hayek, Friedman (and Drucker in his 1939 End of Economic Man) and the Austrian School more generally. More recently and formally, North (1990) has hypothesized that markets function most efficiently in democratic societies due to the personal freedom they allow. Similarly, Sen (1994) highlights the way in which the free transmission of information in democracies facilitates efficient outcomes. This line of analysis, then, takes us beyond the formal constitutional political economy of democratic polities and reminds us of the importance of the many attributes associated with liberal democracy in particular, including civil liberties, a free press, and so forth, all of which may be in short supply in the young democracies of the developing world.

Work showing a relationship between democracy and higher productivity provides empirical support to this hypothesis. Przeworski el al. (2000) find that while dictatorships have higher rates of labor force growth, democracies exhibit more rapid total factor productivity growth. Evidence of an association between democracy and higher productivity can also be found in Minier (1998), Krieckhaus (2005), and Rivera-Batiz (2002). That democracies use existing factor endowments more efficiently would appear to support the idea that some of the more diffuse institutions of democracy serve to bolster economic performance.

===Democracies Young and Old: Does Age Matter?===

Much of the literature relating democratic polities to economic policies and outcomes was written in the context of the advanced industrial states. But young democracies in the developing world initial conditions and political circumstances that could render these models less relevant. Young democracies will by definition have less well-developed democratic structures: electoral processes, institutional mandates, and the composition of political parties may all be fluid and heavily contested in the period following democratization. Furthermore, young democracies may lack the traditions of a free press that informs voters with respect to the performance of their politicians, and the educational system may be weak, with entry—especially to higher education—restricted to the elite. Theoretical analysis as well as previous empirical work suggests that while democratization may provide some immediate benefits, some of its salutary impact on economic performance will be mitigated early on, as governments in such countries may have a particularly hard time formulating and executing consistent policies that provide the cornerstones for sustained growth.

Analysis of economic management in young democracies has focused to a large extent on the effects of the uncertainty present in such circumstances. Haggard and Kaufman stress that “uncertainties with respect to the stability of the new democratic order . . . affect the time horizons of both private and public actors,” leading politicians to pursue “policies aimed at managing opposition in the short run while discounting the gains from less popular reform measures” out of concern that political opponents will resort to non-democratic means (Haggard and Kaufman 1995, 152). Keefer (2005) highlights another source of uncertainty: the fact that politicians and political parties in new democracies lack track records, and thus have difficulty making credible campaign promises. This “credibility of commitment” problem fosters clientelism, as incumbents seek the support of any existing patron-client networks and target spending to benefit small groups, with which credibility is more easily built.

Other theorists have noted the time needed to build democratic institutions beneficial to growth, and suggested that young democracies will consequently reap fewer economic rewards. As Papaioannou and Siourounis point out, the adherents of the Austrian school mentioned in the previous section cautioned, “the benefits of democracy will show themselves only in the long run, while its more immediate achievements may well be inferior.” (Hayek quoted in Papaioannou and Siourounis 2004, 4). In Rodrik’s (1999; 2000) model of social cooperation discussed above, democracy facilitates policy stability only after repeated interactions by groups with competing agendas. This perspective implies an initial absence of norms of compromise, which may amplify the challenges arising because “new democratic governments faceexceptionally strong distributive pressures, both from groups re-entering the political arena after long periods of repression and from established interests demanding reassurance” (Haggard and Kaufman 1995, 152). We would therefore expect policy-making in new democracies to be characterized by acrimonious debate and unwillingness to compromise, resulting in policy volatility and impaired economic performance.

Surprisingly, relatively few studies have investigated the relationship between the age of democratic governments and economic performance. This lacuna stems partly from the preference among analysts for pooling data and thus looking at cross-country differences and at the relationship between long periods of democracy and at averages of economic indicators over time (Papaioannou and Siourounis 2004). Consequently, this gap is being filled as time series analysis becomes widespread. Although Przeworski et al. (2000) have a well-known finding that the older a democracy, the less likely it is to be reversed, he and his colleagues find that the age of democracy is not significantly related to economic performance.

Two more recent studies have found that young democracies in fact perform as well or better than more mature regimes. Controlling for other determinants of economic performance, Gasiorowski finds that average growth and inflation in young democracies do not differ significantly from “mature” democracies, no matter what threshold is used to separate these two groups (2000).4 Rodrik and Wacziarg (2004), on the other hand, find that a dummy variable for the first five years following democratic transition is significantly associated with higher economic growth and with lower variance in growth rates.5 Still another study suggests that states may experience slower growth in the first two years following democratization before seeing acceleration in growth (Papaioannou and Siourounis 2004). The fact that the latter analysis looks only at countries that permanently democratized, however, limits its policy relevance, since many of the greatest economic challenges occur in countries that eventually fell back into dictatorship.

Turning to other indicators of economic performance, Keefer finds that longer periods of uninterrupted democracy are associated with lower corruption, public investment, and public employment, as well as with higher provision of public goods ranging from the rule of law tosecondary education (2005).6 By contrast, Lake and Baum, running time series regressions, find that an increase in a given country's level of democracy results in a statistically significant and rapid jump in public service provision, measured by educational enrollment, life expectancy, and a host of other indicators (2001). The different conclusions reached by these different studies demonstrate that how one asks questions about the economic performance of new democracies, as well as the methodology used to answer that question, affects the results obtained.

===Summary===

As a political system, democracy has a number of distinctive attributes that have been posited by scholars to have important economic effects. By way of summary, we highlight the following hypotheses, some of which point us in contradictory directions:

(1) Owing to the influence of the median voter, democracies are more likely to redistribute income than non-democracies. This, in turn, reduces the growth potential of these polities.

(2) Political competition in democracies drives politicians to reduce taxes and increase expenditures; democracies thus tend toward budget deficits.

(3) Elections generate incentives for politically motivated manipulation of economic policy, resulting in a political business cycle.

(4) Owing to the inability of individual voters to organize effectively, public policy in democracies will be shaped powerfully by rent-seeking and welfare-reducing special interest groups.

(5) Democracies will exhibit greater policy consistency, since repeated negotiations over policy facilitate compromise.

(6) By introducing a modicum of competitive pressure into the monopolistic public sector, democracy will result in the provision of more and better public goods.

(7) In order to maintain the support of their core constituencies, political parties will adopt distinctive economic policies both in their platforms and when they achieve power. Left of center parties will favor the interests of labor; right of center parties those of capital.

(8) The presence of broad-based, cohesive political parties is conducive to high-quality economic management, since these are better able to mediate distributional conflicts.

(9) The separation of powers associated with democracy mitigates the potential for governmental abuse, since the different branches of government can check one another.

(10) The economic policies and performance of democracies depends upon whether they have adopted presidential or parliamentary systems of governance. Parliamentary systems will tend to support larger governments than presidential systems, but may reduce the ability of executives to accumulate and abuse power.

(11) The younger the democracy, the more unstable its economic policies and performance.

In the following section, we explore these hypotheses through the lens of the particular public policies that democracies actually adopt.

==II. Economic Policy in Young Democracies==

While democracy may have a direct effect on GDP growth, most studies of the overall democracy and growth relationship envision the former as having various positive or negative impacts on the latter through a variety of different channels, including those highlighted in the previous section: electoral politics, interest groups, institutions, and the age of the regime. This list, however, is far from exhaustive. Scholars have examined numerous other channels through which democracy affects growth (for in-depth discussions of this approach, see Tavares and Wacziarg 2001; Krieckhaus 2005; and Bourgignon and Verdier 2000). The advantages of an analytical approach that focuses on the precise pathways by which democracy influences economic policy and performance are twofold.

First, examining specific channels through which democracy impacts growth avoids some of the methodological pitfalls associated with simply plugging a variable measuring democracy into a standard growth regression. As Baum and Lake note, most studies adopting that approach do put forward some of the theoretical arguments regarding the democracy-growth relationship, but fail to account for the implied multi-colinearity in their econometric work (2003, 335). They cite as an example the argument that democracy encourages growth by rendering property rights more secure. This implies that measures of democracy will be correlated with investment—presumably another variable in the growth regression—since investors face less uncertainty about their returns. 

Investigating the relationship between democracy and specific policies, which in turn impact growth, helps to avoid this misspecification and thus may offer clearer indications of a causal relationship between democracy and economic growth. Second, this methodology provides more concrete guidance to policy-makers, both in developing countries and in industrialized countries seeking to promote development through foreign aid and other policies. Consequently, in this section we examine the specific economic policies that the leaders of young democracies seem to pursue through the lens provided by recent empirical research. We find that this approach indeed produces more clear-cut findings.

===Fiscal Policy===

As already noted in the first section of this paper, it has long been held that democratically elected politicians will seek to minimize taxation while maximizing government spending, and that as a result democracies will tend toward budget deficits. But empirical research suggests that the relationship between democracy and fiscal policy is complex, with some studies finding that democratic governments do not differ in their fiscal policies from non-democratic regimes, while others find that democracies, particularly younger democracies, do tend to have looser fiscal policies.

In a pioneering study that compares and contrasts the economic policies of democracies and non-democracies, Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin (2004) find no significant relationship between countries' level of democracy and their average education spending, social security spending, and corporate tax rates, although they do find that more democratic states tend to have somewhat lower average government revenue than less democratic ones.7 Similarly, Satyanath and Subramanian (2004), find no robust relationship between levels of democracy and government consumption as a percent of GDP.8

However, in their broader study of the channels by which democracy affects economic growth, Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) find that the level of democracy is associated with higher government spending9. Similarly, Block (2002) finds that countries with competitive elections tend to exhibit higher current government expenditure than in countries without competitive elections. Further complicating the picture, Keefer (2005) finds a significant negative relationship between the number of years of uninterrupted democracy in a country and the average public sector wage bill as well as public investment (both as a percentage of GDP) over the period.

In fact, these results may not necessarily conflict with one another, due to the differences in the analytical techniques used and in the variables examined. The results of Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) and Keefer (2005) appear most directly relevant to the study of new democracies, the former because their time series regression takes account of within-country variation, and the latter because Keefer employs the age of democracy as an independent variable in his cross country regression. Thus, it would appear that young democracies may exhibit initial increases in public spending possibly followed by a longer-term decline.

===Monetary Policy===

Given its importance to economic well-being at both the macro- and micro-levels, few topics have attracted more research in political economy than the making of monetary policy (Drazen 2001). Monetary policy presents numerous puzzles for researchers, including the failure of some states to control inflation or to regulate the banking system and its money creation function. 

Further, researchers have been attracted to normative questions of institutional design: how does one enhance the credibility of commitment to monetary stabilization in those cases where policy-makers have a poor track record? In seeking to answer both these positive andnormative issues, political economists have explored a wide-range of variables that could influence the making of monetary policy, including the presence or absence of political business cycles and of democratic institutions that constrain (or not) financial profligacy.

In their broad analysis of the relationship between macroeconomic stability and democracy, for example, Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) find that the average level of democracy in a country has a significant and substantial negative association with average money supply growth over the period 1960 to 1990. Following the line of analysis put forward by Rodrik (2000), they attribute this relationship to the superior ability of democratic institutions to mediate distributive conflicts; indeed, more generally, democracy may be conceptualized as a technology for the peaceful resolution of distributive conflicts, which contributes to growth in myriad ways.

More narrowly, in studying monetary policy in Africa, Guillaume and Stasavage (2005) similarly find that democratic institutions enhance the quality of monetary policy-making. They note that monetary policy credibility depends crucially not simply on central bank independence, but on the extent of checks and balances in place to guarantee Central Bank independence. Formal structures such as constitutionally established vetoes can help to put such checks in place, but so can more informal institutions, such as multi-party democracy and the existence of coalition governments. Thus, while they do not test the relationship between better democracy and monetary policy econometrically, the find that higher levels of democracy are one factor facilitating the development of a credible monetary policy.

Although these studies do not directly address the conduct of monetary policy in new democracies, some suggestive implications can be drawn. Both, for example, stress the importance of effective institutions; in the case of Satyanath and Subramanian (2004), these institutions mediate distributive conflicts, while in the case of Guillaume and Stasavage (2005) they check political actors seeking to manipulate policy. Consequently, while democracy may facilitate better monetary policy over the medium and long term, new democracies with nascent institutions could be expected to experience difficulties controlling monetary management. We explore this question in greater detail below as we explore other economic policies that democratic leaders might seek to manipulate for political reasons.

===Exchange Rate Policy===

The choice of exchange rates has become one of the most difficult issues of economic policy facing governments in the post-Bretton Woods era. Faced with the “unholy Trinity” of trade-offs among competing economic objectives, nations must seemingly adopt the least of the evils and hope for the best. The near-continuous cycle of currency crises and exchange rate collapses since the 1970s suggests that the world’s economic managers are far from achieving a stable equilibrium.

Why do states find it so difficult to commit to credible exchange rate policies? Willett (2004) suggests that any analysis of that question must focus on politics. In particular, he asserts that owing to conflicting political pressures—say between interest groups and the median voter—“governments will not always choose policy regimes that are ideal from the standpoint of generating economic efficiency and avoiding crisis…” Alesina and Wagner (2004) find empirical support for this proposition in their study of the relationship between broad measures of institutional quality and exchange rate policy. Specifically, they find that countries with poor institutions tend to attempt to peg their exchange rates, but then fail to maintain the peg. Nonetheless, more fine-grained analysis may help illuminate how political parties and institutions aggregate competing interests within the cockpit of electoral politics, and the exchange rate policies that are generated as a result. We are unaware of any empirical work that takes the sort of theoretical sketch provided by Willett and others and examines it on either a case study or cross-country basis.

Instead, most research compares and contrasts “democracies” and “non-democracies” at the most abstract and aggregate level. Satyanath and Subramanian (2004), for example, use annual average changes in the nominal parallel market exchange rate as a broad measure of macroeconomic stability, noting that this variable reflects not only incorporates domestic factors such as inflation, but also external factors, such as problems with the balance of payments and debt. They find that the level of democracy has a significant and robust negative association with exchange rate volatility, with much larger coefficients than other variables tested, including income inequality and openness to trade. While Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) do not examine exchange rate policy specifically, Block et al. (2002) do attempt to determine whether political considerations impinge on exchange rate management. They find evidence that devaluations are postponed in pre-election periods, presumably to avoid provoking public dissatisfaction by increasing the price of imports.

Tavares and Wacziarg (2001), in contrast, observe no significant relationship between the level of democracy in a country and the black market premium on the exchange rate,10 which they employ as a proxy variable to measure distortion economic policies more broadly. Consequently, while exchange rate volatility may be lower in democracies, it is not because their exchange rate policies are more or less distorted. Clearly, more nuanced research is needed to advance our understanding of the political economy of exchange rate management.

===Public Goods Provision===

If voters have any direct influence in democracy, one might expect it to be felt in the area of public goods provision. Normally, voters want the state to provide education, health care, a clean environment, infrastructure, and an ever-expanding list of goods and services. In a major survey linking democracy and public goods, Lake and Baum (2001) find that public goods provision is not only greater in democracies but is generally qualitatively superior to that in less democratic countries as well. In cross sectional regressions, they find that higher levels of democracy are associated with better education, as measured by a host of indicators including literacy, primary school student-teacher ratios, and the level of enrollment at all grades, and with better health, as measured by life expectancy, mortality, vaccinations, and population per physician, as well as access to healthcare and clean water.11 Lake and Baum (2001) also run time series regressions and find that an increase in a given country's level of democracy results in a statistically significant and rapid jump in public service provision.

These results are also supported by descriptive statistics included in Papaioannou and Siourounis (2004), indicating that democratization yields rapid increases in life expectancy and schooling. Likewise, Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) find that higher levels of democracy are associated with higher average years of secondary schooling. Keefer (2005) also finds that longer periods of uninterrupted democracy are characterized by higher average secondary school enrollment, further bolstering the claim that democracy is associated with better public service provision.

That a positive relationship exists between democracy and the provision of public goods, specifically education and healthcare, appears straightforward. Both cross country and timeseries analyses indicate that greater democracy is associated with more and better educational and health outcomes. The evidence also suggests that even in new democracies, performance in this area tends to improve fairly rapidly. The posited theoretical reason for this apparently strong relationship is the demand of the median voter for such public goods, which of course are paid for by the polity at large. This could also be consistent with a broader political strategy of consolidating young democracies through the delivery of basic services, as well as the Aristotelian idea that since democracies rely on a cadre of educated citizens, they should be expected to invest in human capital. We note that while Persson and Tabellini posit that parliamentary regimes in particular should be relatively more effective at delivering public goods, we are unaware of any explicit comparisons of performance across different institutional structures in the context of the newly democratic states.

===Trade Policy===

Few public policies are more contested in democracies than foreign trade, and probably none have been subject to more research by political economists. With respect to developing countries, one of the major puzzles that has been examined in the literature is the shift to more liberal trade policies during the 1980s and 1990s, which seems surprising in view of the much-touted abilities of protectionist interest groups to block policy changes. In their analysis of this puzzle, Milner and Kubota (2005) find that higher levels of democracy are associated with more liberal trade regimes, particularly in the newer, developing-world democracies.12 Their results are robust to the inclusion of variables measuring other factors frequently cited as causing trade liberalization, such as economic crisis and external pressure. The conclusion they draw follows Mayer (1984) and Rodrik (1998) in suggesting the importance of the median voter. Since the median voter in the developing world profits from intensive use of her labor, she may have a strong interest in increasing labor-intensive exports and capital-intensive imports. While this analysis is plausible, it must be emphasized that these authors do not empirically investigate whether or not the median voter does in fact benefit from trade liberalization. Indeed, evidence on this point is mixed. While Bourguignon and Morrison (1990) find that openness is associated with a reduction and inequality, Kapstein and Milanovic (2003) have shown that the medianvoter in the poorest countries does not benefit economically from globalization, a finding that poses a puzzle for this line of analysis.
Papaioannou and Siourounis include in their examination of the democracy-growth relationship descriptive statistics showing that &quot;democratizations are followed by a substantial increase in international trade . . . &quot; (2004: 10), indicating that the policy changes encountered by Milner and Kubota (2005) produce real increases in trade as a percentage of GDP. This finding is confirmed by Tavares and Wacziarg, who show that a greater degree of democracy is significantly associated with a greater trade-to-GDP ratio. Other research encountering a positive relationship between democracy and trade liberalization includes Dethier et al.’s (1999) study of economic reform in post-Communist countries. In a pooled OLS regression they find that countries' average scores on the Freedom House index are significantly associated with an index of liberalization that includes trade liberalization, domestic price liberalization, and privatization.

The robust finding that more democratic governments tend to have more liberal trade policies suggests that young democracies are likely to liberalize trade with a resulting increase in their trade-to-GDP ratios. However, the reasons for this shift in trade policy and performance have yet to be conclusively determined.

===Privatization===

Privatization of state-owned enterprises has also proved controversial, which is not surprising given that it generally means worker displacement and rising unemployment, as new owners of formerly state-owned enterprises seek to make organizational changes that will enhance efficiency. Does this mean that young democracies, which could be especially motivated to avoid increasing unemployment, are likely to put privatization decisions on hold? Surprisingly, that does not seem to be the case.

In their study of 76 developing countries during the period 1987 to 1994, Biglaiser and Danis (2002) find that the presence of democracy has a substantial and significant positive association with the extent of privatization.13 Indeed, simple averages for each year in theirsample show that democracies privatized more than non-democracies in every year. This relationship holds even when controlling for numerous other factors generally cited as partial determinants of privatization, such as the level of development, the fiscal deficit, and the current account position. They explain their findings by noting that while proposals for privatization in democracies may be met with highly visible protests on the part of such affected groups as workers, within authoritarian regimes it is the executives at state-owned enterprises who will effectively exert pressure from behind closed doors to block privatization. The association between democracy and privatization is supported by the above-mentioned study of post-Communist countries by Dethier et al. (1999), which employs as a dependent variable an index that includes as one of its components privatization of state-owned enterprises.

Further, as Kapstein and Milanovic (2003) have shown, in many new democracies privatization has been associated with the rise of social spending targeted at displaced workers. Rather than assisting the poor or those who are most vulnerable, political actors have sought to win support for privatization and globalization by providing side-payments in the form of unemployment insurance and pension reform, thus permitting them to make the transition to the new, private sector-oriented economies in which their skills may be in high demand. Thus, privatization and other economically disruptive policies may succeed particularly in those democratic settings where they are associated with more generous safety net provision.

===Institutional Quality===

Among their many attributes, democracies are often portrayed as less corrupt and administratively more efficient than non-democracies, and older democracies are posited to be better managed than younger democratic states. Keefer (2005) tests the relationship between the age of democracy and variables he sees as symptomatic of clientelistic behavior, and finds that longer periods of democracy are associated with lower corruption, higher bureaucratic quality, and the rule of law (as well as with higher secondary school enrollment and lower public sector spending, as mentioned above). Numerous other studies support the hypothesis that democracy is associated with lower corruption (Treisman 2000)14 and higher institutional quality (Rivera-Batiz
2002).15 Similarly, Rigobon and Rodrik (2004) find that democracy and the rule of law are mutually reinforcing.16

While much of this literature finds that democracy improves institutional quality only after an extended period of time (Keefer 2005, Treisman 2000), other work has found its effect to be more immediate. In a study of economic performance in post-Communist countries, Beck and Laeven (2005) find that the level of democracy in 1992 is significantly and positively associated with the level institutional development in 1996.17 The theoretical analyses discussed in the previous section, which see democracy as checking abusive government and introducing competitive pressures into the public sector, provide some indication of the causal mechanisms behind these findings. However, further exploration into how and when democratic government produces better institutions, if that is indeed the case, is need.

===The Political Business Cycle===

As discussed in Section I, political business cycle (PBC) theory makes the general claim that electoral schedules influence a country’s economic policies. While the theory of political business cycles suggests that politicians will attempt to manipulate growth to further their chances of reelection, in practice their ability to do this may be severely limited, particularly in developing countries. While increasing the rate of GDP growth with sufficient precision to affect the outcome of an election is a tall order for officials in even the most developed economies, the ability of governments in developing countries to do this is extremely limited due to relatively low levels of monetization, the small size of government expenditure to GDP, and greater vulnerability to external shocks (Schuknecht 1996; Brender and Drazen 2004). It is thus unsurprising that no studies have found that PBCs in developing countries cause growth to change in the periods before or after elections. For example, Schuknecht (1996) finds no association between election periods and changes in output growth.18 Similarly, in a study ofAfrican economies, Block el al. (2002) mention in passing that they find no association between multi-party or founding elections and growth.

Other evidence suggests that this failure to impact aggregate economic performance is not for lack of trying. Block (2002) finds that current expenditure picks up in election years, but only in countries holding competitive elections.19 Consequently, a shift from dictatorship to democracy implies the emergence of a political budget cycles.20 Whereas Block (2002) compares democratic and non-democratic regimes, Block et al. (2003) contrast new democracies with more established ones, and find that political budget cycles—manifested through increased public spending, net claims on government, and seignorage—are more pronounced under newer democratic governments.21 They find that these impacts are amplified when the election in question is a founding election, defined as the first competitive election after a period of non-competitive or no elections. Moreover, founding elections are associated with acceleration of the growth of the money supply (specifically M1). They outline a number of reasons why PBCs might be more pronounced in new democracies. Not only do incumbents who have not been competitively elected likely have more discretion to manipulate the economy, but such leaders have an incentive to fend off any challengers early in order to minimize future competition (Block et al. 2002: 9,12).

The association between new democracies and political business cycles is confirmed by Brender and Drazen (2004), who find that political budget cycles are present only in new democracies. In a sample of 68 democracies from 1960 to 2001, they find that if the sample is narrowed to exclude the first four elections following democratization, all traces of a political budget cycle disappear. By contrast, election year dummies are significantly associated with higher deficits and greater expenditure during the first four elections following democratization.

Including separate dummy variables for the first, second, third, and fourth election following democratization shows that the significance of the election-year declines as the democracy ages.

These studies of the political business cycle suggest that new democracies will undergo an increase in the variability of rates of inflation and money supply growth and in the level and composition of government spending. In addition to the disruptions that these variations cause, they will also likely retard growth in the years after democratization. Ramey and Ramey (1995: 1148) note that volatility in monetary growth and fiscal policy— precisely the variables affected by the political business cycle—significantly lowers growth. Exploring this relationship in detail, Aizenman and Marion (1999) find that volatility in these variables is associated with lower private investment, which presumably hampers growth.

As noted in Section I above, the political business cycle may theoretically enhance economic efficiency, since it allows the electorate to select the most competent candidate, although this result depends on whether or not one assumes that politicians know whether or not they are competent (Persson and Tabellini 2000).22 To date, no one has found evidence of this theoretically possible “efficient PBC.” Consequently, the presence of political business cycles in new democracies, with the concomitantly higher volatility of monetary and fiscal variables and the resulting slower growth, suggests that new democracies may face particular challenges in the formulation of economic policy.

===Summary===

Just as democracies have distinctive political attributes, they also seem to generate some distinctive public policies. Further, the age of democracy seems to matter to economic policy-making, with older democracies performing better than younger democracies across a range of measures. To highlight some of the major findings of the empirical literature, we note that:

(1) Democracies, including young democracies, appear to provide more and better public services to their citizens.

(2) Democracies, including young democracies, are more open to trade than non-democracies, perhaps due to the median voter’s influence.

(3) Democracies, including young democracies, are more likely to privatize their state-owned enterprises than non-democracies.

(4) Democracies have better institutional quality than non-democracies, but older democracies fare better along this dimension than do young democracies.

(5) Politicians in young democracies appear to make extensive use of the political business cycle, introducing macroeconomic volatility into the growth equation.

In the following section, we examine the extent to which these findings are supported by our new data set, which is more up-to-date and includes more cases than most data sets used in the studies cited herein.

==III. Economic Performance of Young Democracies==

In this section we provide an overview of the economic performance of young democracies since 1960. Overall, since 1960 we count 114 total episodes of democratization, 44 of which were reversed at some point; among those that were reversed, several then later underwent second and even third democratization episodes, as indicated by Table 1 below (see Appendix 1 for precise definitions and methodology). Overall, nearly 38 percent of the democratizations that occurred between 1960 and 2003 eventually underwent reversals, ceasing to be democracies for some period of time.23 Cases in which countries underwent democratization for the first time in the post-1960 period had nearly the same rate of reversal (38.6 percent), as those undergoing democratization for the second time (41.7 percent). In contrast, only one of the six cases in which a country democratized for a third time was reversed, while in the single case in which a country underwent a fourth democratization, it was not reversed.

The question that we ask in this section is whether differences can be discerned among those that successfully democratize and those that undergo total reversals. We also wish to see if any regional differences can be found among the world’s young democracies in terms of their economic performance. Overall, our objective is to see whether the descriptive statistics yield any patterns that could be amenable to more precise testing. To this end, we examine the average economic performance of countries in each of the ten years following democratization. As we will see, we believe that some intriguing patterns do indeed emerge. We leave aside issues of specific causality in this working paper, with the intention of addressing this question in our monograph.

Before describing our findings, a brief discussion of our methodology is warranted. Our unit of analysis is young democracies, and as mentioned above, some countries have undergone more than one democratization in the period under study. We have counted each episode of democracy as a separate case. The analysis in this section compares the average performance of cases in which democratization did not undergo a reversal to that of those in which it was ultimately reversed. As is evident from a look at the underlying data included in Appendix 2, the size of the group of new democracies that eventually undergo reversals falls over time, as each year a few countries cease to be democracies. Because we are interested in how new democratic governments manage the economy, it would not make sense to include years in which a country’s government was not democratic.24

The example of Argentina provides an illustration of this methodology. Argentina democratized twice during the period: once in 1973 and again in 1983. These two episodes count in our dataset as two separate young democracies. In the former case, democracy was overthrown in 1976. As a consequence, Argentina from 1973 to 1975 is included in the subgroup of young democracies that are ultimately reversed, but drops out after the second year (i.e. 1973 is year zero, the year of democratization; 1974 is year one; 1975 is year two). The episode of democracy in Argentina that began in 1983 is included in the subgroup of young democracies that were not reversed (with 1983 counting as year zero of democracy, 1984 as year one, and so on).

===Growth===

Contrasting the economic performance of successful new democracies with that of democratizations that were ultimately reversed reveals that growth in the former trends upwards, while the latter shows no clear trend, as Figure 1 demonstrates. Because the initial difference in the average growth rates is statistically significant as are the differences in later years,25 it would appear that growth in unreversed democracies is on average lower in the years immediately following democratization, but overtakes that of reversed democracies around the seventh year after democratization. This finding is particularly interesting in light of those theories discussed in Section I suggesting that democracy takes time to yield economic benefits (Haggard and Kaufman 1995; Keefer 2005, Rodrik 1999, 2000). Young democracies that ultimately undergo total reversals may cut corners early on, avoiding some of the challenges of democratization but forgoing its later benefits.

Figure 2 suggests that rates of investment are also significantly higher in unreversed new democracies than in countries where democracy is overthrown, although in both cases it trends upward. Moreover, the variance of investment falls steadily in unreversed new democracies, while exhibiting no clear trend in countries where democratization is ultimately reversed. The literature focusing on the demands for redistribution unleashed by democracy (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006) casts this pattern in an interesting light. Lower investment may signal misgivings on the part of those holding capital regarding the desirability of democracy, doubts that later translate into support for a return to authoritarianism. In short, after an initial honeymoon period, it appears that investors in some democracies quickly become aware of the fragility or perhaps undesirability of their political system and investment levels stagnate.

===Inflation===

Analysis of inflation in young democracies is complicated by a handful of cases that experienced periods of hyperinflation, with the annual change in consumer prices reaching into the thousands of percent. In the interest of uncovering general trends, we here exclude rates of inflation more than five standard deviations above the average for each subgroup for each year. To cite the most extreme example, Peru in 1990 (ten years after democratization) recorded inflation of nearly 7500 percent. As this is more than eight hundred standard deviations above the average for the “reversals” subgroup ten years after democratization, we exclude this value.26 The trends discussed here are robust to changes in the rule used to exclude extreme values.

Applying this methodology, consumer price inflation in unreversed new democracies is initially high, but trends downward, while inflation in new democracies undergoing reversals shows no clear trend, fluctuating around 15 percent throughout the period. Average rates of inflation converge around the seventh year after democratization, as Figure 3 illustrates. As would be expected, data on the average rate of money supply growth and the average change in the official exchange rate show very similar trends.

These trends are broadly in line with the findings of Block et al. (2003) that democratization is associated with acceleration in the growth of the money supply, but that this slows again as democracy ages. This pattern also lends also credence to the idea, discussed in Section I, that thebenefits of democracy take time to materialize, either because of the uncertainty present under a new political regime or because institution-building takes time. Where these difficulties are confronted early on, economic performance may be initially inferior but later improve, while in cases where they are suppressed, the seeds for later democratic reversal may be planted.

===Government Spending===

Government spending as measured by public consumption as a percentage of GDP is initially about three percentage points higher in democracies that do not undergo total reversals than in those that do, a statistically significant difference. However, while spending trends downward in the former, it rises in the latter, and the two converge roughly nine years after democratization, as can be seen in Figure 4. That no political budget cycle is evident in this data is not surprising, since election schedules differ between the countries in the sample.

These trends could be interpreted to mean that while the state in successful new democracies initially responds to demands for resources from the newly empowered population with relative largesse, it later grows more capable of managing such demands in a fiscally responsible manner. By contrast, governments in countries ultimately undergoing another reversal apparently become less able to assuage such demands, and become gradually more profligate.

===Openness===

Figure 5 suggests that successful new democracies do on average exhibit greater openness to trade than new democracies that are later reversed, as measured by the ratio of imports plus exports over GDP, and once again, the difference is statistically significant, with the null hypothesis of equal average openness rejected in all 11 years. Both groups show an upward trend in openness over the ten years following democratization. This finding is in line with other work indicating that democracy facilitates trade liberalization as well as economic reform more broadly (for example, Milner and Kubota 2005).

===Ethnic Divisions===

Numerous studies have found that a higher degree of ethnic fractionalization is associated with slower economic growth, higher corruption, and low institutional quality (Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock 2005; Alesina et al. 2002), suggesting that countries with an above-average degree of ethnic division may face particular difficulties when undergoing democratization. Our data appear to support this proposition. Table 2 suggests that while new democracies with lower levels of ethnic fractionalization on average have a significantly higher rate of economic growth during the first five years prior to democratization, the average growth rates of the two groups converge in the second five-year period after democratization. This would appear to support theories that view democracy's ability to facilitate conflict resolution as salutary for growth. Interestingly, whereas growth rises with democratization in countries with below-average ethnic fractionalization, it falls with democratization in the more ethnically diverse countries, perhaps due to the disruption caused by the airing of ethnic conflicts suppressed during periods of authoritarian rule.

Similarly, young democracies with a lower than average degree of ethnic fractionalization have average rates of investment that are 1-2 percent of GDP higher than those with relatively greater fractionalization. Again, there is some trend towards convergence toward the end of the first ten years following democratization, although the differences between the average rates of investment are statistically significant at the 1 percent level in every year. Analysis of inflation data also lends support to the following hypothesis: that governments of states with higher than average levels of ethnic fractionalization have difficulty managing the economy in the years immediately following democratization, but to some extent master these difficulties over time.

Thus, our data suggest that the level of ethnic fractionalization plays a role in determining how well young democracies are able to deal with the challenges of political development and economic management, with states characterized by a high degree of ethnic division having more difficulty managing the economy in the initial period following the transition from authoritarianism.

===Regional Variations===

Changes in key economic indicators in new democracies follow quite different trajectories in different regions, a finding in line with those of Krieckhaus's (2005) contention that democracy's economic impact varies by region. While we will not pursue here the reasons for this variation in detail—that topic will be fully developed in our monograph on the economics of young democracies—we might simply assert that we do not believe that these differences can be ascribed solely to such “initial conditions” as geography. As Steven Fish has written, “polities undergoing regime change do not necessarily suffer under a tyranny of initial conditions. They make their own fates” (Fish 2001, 82). What this suggests is that democratic institutions and economic policy decisions also matter greatly, and that these are not merely a function of a region’s prior history. They are also a reflection of the ideas that leaders hold, the institutions—e.g. independent central banks—that they do or do not establish, the support they receive from foreign donors, and the possibility of anchoring their economies in a larger entity like the European Union. These hypotheses will be pursued in the monograph version of our work. For now, we will simply summarize the variation that we observe.

In terms of growth, the performance of Eastern European countries differs significantly from that of other new democracies, with output contracting in the first three years after democratization and growth resuming four years after democratization, as is apparent from Figure 6. This sharply different growth trajectory, presumably caused by the specific circumstances of the transition from communism, demonstrates the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions about the economic performance of young democracies and their survival or failure.

Interestingly, average growth for new democracies in Sub-Saharan Africa generally matches and even outperforms that of the other countries in the sample, as Figure 7 illustrates. This result is likely a product of the strong performance of newly independent democracies in the region during the 1960s, a period of stronger growth worldwide. Indeed, if cases classified as new democracies at independence are excluded from the African group, average growth falls by a percentage point or more.

Trends in inflation exhibit similar regional divergences.27 While new democracies in Latin America are plagued by high and volatile inflation, Eastern European nations faced high and variable inflation immediately after the transition to democracy, but this has since moderated. By contrast, average inflation in Africa rarely exceeds 10 percent, as Figure 9 demonstrates. It is worth noting that Africa’s relatively low average inflation was not solely a result of 14 countries’ membership in the CFA Franc zone. While new democracies in this monetary union do exhibit low inflation—under 10 percent on average, consumer price inflation in Sub-Saharan African countries outside of the CFA Franc Zone has averaged under 20 percent, well below the averages seen in Latin America and Eastern European countries in the early years of democracy.

Once again, it would appear that the high inflation in new Eastern European democracies was a consequence of the transition from communism, which they were able to overcome during the first five years following democratization. The Latin American countries' inability to reign in inflation on a consistent basis could be taken as evidence that the region's young democracies have failed to mediate between groups demanding resources, instead resorting to expansionary policies that have periodically produced hyperinflation.

Regional differences are also apparent in public spending, with the four regions with substantial numbers of new democracies having fairly different levels, as is apparent from Figure 9. Few clear trends are apparent, although the persistent regional differences suggest one explanation for the lack of clear conclusions in the literature on public policy and democracy, since many such studies do not include regional dummies (for example, Rivera-Batiz 2002).

===Summary===

This analysis bears out the implications drawn from broader literature on growth and democracy, in particular that new democracies that ultimately undergo reversals under-perform relative to their successful counterparts. Although growth is initially lower in the sustained democratizers, it continually rises over time. By contrast, countries in which democracy is ultimately reversed show a trend of stagnant or falling growth. Similarly, new democracies that do not undergo reversals have higher inflation in the early years, but improve over time. Investment is also lower in democracies that experience reversals, as is trade openness. Government spending also trends upwards in countries where democratization is reversed and trends downward in successful democratizers. 
Overall, it would appear that establishing economic credibility early in the democratic mandate is a difficult task, but once such credibililty is gained, growth accelerates and inflation stabilizes. Where credibility is absent, these variables show no such positive trend. This suggests that discovering the deeper sources of economic policy credibility in young democracies should be a major target of research.

This analysis also demonstrates the need for detailed regional case studies. Growth and inflation evolve in markedly different ways in new democracies in different regions, while regional differences in public spending greatly overshadow changes in spending during the ten years following democratization. Understanding the reasons behind this regional variation will be one of our major tasks in the monograph that we are also writing.

==IV. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations==

There are few greater policy challenges today than ensuring the success of the world’s many unconsolidated democracies. As we have seen, the economic performance of new democracies—and hence the chances of regime survival—has varied along a number of critical variables, including their ability to maintain investment levels, to control the money supply and budget deficits, and to open their economies to foreign trade. We have also seen that regional differences are significant, with Latin American democracies in particular experiencing the most volatility in terms of economic performance. Pursuing the sources of these differences is clearly a crucial task for research.

From a policy perspective, our work makes several points that we believe are relevant to public officials in both developing countries and the industrial world:

First, the evidence suggests that leaders in young democracies often face trade-offs between their electoral and economic reform objectives. The tendency of leaders to exploit the political business cycle in the run-up to elections indicates that in some settings political competition may induce behavior that is inconsistent with the building of strong economic foundations for sustained growth.

Second, the capacity of leaders in new democracies to pilot their economies varies a great deal across countries. This means that “one size fits all” policy solutions are unlikely to be appropriate where democratic consolidation is a fundamental medium-term objective, and that particular country circumstances must be taken into account as the two tracks of economic reform and democracy-building are pursued.

Third, foreign aid donors must recognize the richness of the democratic experience around the world and the various forms that it takes. While some of the academic literature suggests, for example, that parliamentary regimes may be more growth-enhancing than presidential systems, that work hardly provides a conclusive basis for preferring one type of democracy over the other. Still, the potential costs and benefits of different electoral and institutional systems are worth full consideration as new democracies shape their constitutional political economy.

Fourth, our analysis of the economic performance of new democracies strongly suggests that deteriorating or stagnant economic performance constitutes a red flag or warning signal that the country is at risk of political reversal. Poor economic performance—low growth, high inflation, etc.—during the first five years following a democratization is not necessarily cause for alarm. However, if that performance does not pick up or deteriorates, democracy is at greater risk of being overthrown. Although the direction of causality remains to be settled—does failure to improve economic performance discredit the regime, or is such performance a symptom of weak institutions?—new democracies plagued by negative growth and high inflation, and which fail to undertake such necessary reforms as trade liberalization and privatization, merit the attention of foreign aid donors who seek to promote democratic consolidation.

NOTES

1 This argument, it will be observed, rings of the “fiscal federalism” literature which argues that federalist systems introduce competition into the public sector by allowing economic agents to “vote with their feet,” forcing local governors to restrain their personal rent-seeking and provide the public services that people actually want. However, questions may be raised about the economic benefits of political decentralization in those developing countries where government institutions are too weak to provide many of the public goods that citizens demand.

2 We thank Phil Keefer for emphasizing this point.

3 Notwithstanding recent instances of electorates unwilling to wait until the next election to unseat incumbents, as in Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Thailand, and the Philippines.

4 Gasiorowski (2000) employs a dataset of his own construction, which classifies 97 countries as democratic, semi-democratic, or authoritarian in each year from independence through 1992.

5 Rodrik and Wacziarg (2004) analyze data from 154 countries. They look specifically at the average rate of GDP growth in the five years following democratization.

6 Rather than treating each country in each year as an observation, Keefer treats each episode of uninterrupted democracy as an observation and averages the values of the dependent variables over the episode. He uses data from 1975 to 2000. He classifies as democracies regimes with a top score on the Legislative and Executive Indices of Electoral Competition from the World Bank’s Database on Political Institutions. Indicators of corruption, bureaucratic quality, and the rule of law are from Political Risk Service’s International Country Risk Guide.

7 Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin (2004) average the country's Polity IV score over the 30-year period to measure democracy.

8 Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) employ the average of the Polity IV variable measuring the level of constraints on the executive to measure the level of democracy in a country during the period in question.

9 Note that they use Freedom House ratings.

10 The premium is defined as the difference between the black market rate and the official rate, divided by the official rate.

11 Baum and Lake (2001) use the overall Polity III score to measure the level of democracy.

12 Milner and Kubota (2005) measure democracy using the Polity IV score, and run time series cross-sectional regressions to test its relationship with openness, as measured by both the unweighted average tariff rate and the Sachs-Warner dummy variable. They analyze a sample of 100 countries over the period 1970 to 1999.

13 Biglaiser and Danis (2002) use the Polity IV score to construct a dummy variable that classifies countries as either democratic or non-democratic. They measure the level of privatization in a country with a variable consisting of thevalue of privatizations in a given year divided by the state-owned enterprises' share of GDP in the previous year multiplied by the current year’s GDP.

14 Treisman (2000) uses Transparency International’s perceived corruption index to measure corruption. He obtains like results employing the Freedom House rating and Przeworski et al.’s classification.

15 Rivera-Batiz (2002) studies this relationship using a sample of 115 countries and employing pooled OLS regression, averaging the variables' values over the period 1950 to 1990. He measures democracy with the Freedom House index, and institutional quality using the index constructed by Hall and Jones (1999), which combines the Political Risk Service institutional quality index with the Sachs-Warner dichotomous measure of openness.

16 Rigobon and Rodrik (2004) define democracy in terms of the Polity IV score.

17 Beck and Laeven (2005) use the Polity IV score for constraints on the executive in 1992 as their measure of democracy. They assess institutional quality using an index that includes corruption, the rule of law, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness, among other things

18 Schuknecht (1996) examines a sample of 35 developing countries between 1970 and 1992.

19 Block examines a sample of 69 developing countries. As independent variables, he selects indices of electoral competitiveness and democracy (both taken from the World Bank’s Database of Political Institutions) as well as a dummy variable for election years. On the assumption that leaders facing reelection will boost current expenditure, which tends to more immediately benefit voters, Block employs current expenditure as a share of total central government expenditure as the dependent variable.

20 Interestingly, whereas Keefer (2005) finds that the proportion of public spending devoted to investment will fall as democracies mature, Block (2002) finds evidence that electoral contestation is associated with a fall in public investment as a share of GDP. These results are not necessarily contradictory, since investment as a share of the government budget may rise while falling as a percentage of GDP. Nonetheless, their logic conflicts on a theoretical level: Keefer views public investment as a prime avenue for clientelistic channeling of jobs and money to supporters, whereas Block sees current expenditure as the easiest way to direct public resources to supporters.

21 Block et al. (2002) use a sample of 44 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1980 to 1995 and employ as independent variables an election-year dummy and a dummy for competitive elections.

22 In this model, if politicians think they are competent, then they will attempt to ramp up spending or stimulate the economy. By contrast, if a politician knows he is incompetent the costs of macroeconomic manipulation to him personally will outweigh the gains from trying to trick voters into believing he is competent.

23 Some of the new democracies that were not totally reversed did undergo minor democratic reversals. While we do not discuss such cases separately here, we will do so in our monograph. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Appendix 1.

24 This may at first glance generate concerns about attrition bias; however, this would only undermine our findings if the democracies undergoing reversals during the period in question exhibited better economic performance than those countries that remained democracies for the first ten years after democratization. That various studies (most notably Przeworski et al. 2000) have found that the countries with low or negative growth are more likely to undergo reversals suggests that our findings are not driven by attrition bias. Indeed, if only countries in which democracy endured for at least 10 years, but was eventually reversed, are included in the reversals group, the general relationships described continue to hold.

25 The null hypothesis that the average growth rates for the two groups are equal can be rejected at the 5 percent level in 6 of the 11 years. References to statistical significance in this section refer to t-tests of the difference between means of independent samples.

26 The instances of hyperinflation excluded are: Argentina (1984-5,88-91), Bolivia (1984-5), Brazil (1988–94), Nicaragua (1990-1), Peru (1988–90), Armenia (1994), Belarus (1993-4), Bulgaria (1997), Lithuania (1993), Romania (1993, 1997), and Ukraine (1993-5).

27 Whereas we excluded cases of hyperinflation from the discussion of inflation above, in this subsection, we have included these episodes. The fact hyperinflation occurred in two particular regions suggests it is an important part of the regional story, and should not be left out.

|}

* The first argument is a ''target register'' which value is affected by the instruction.
* The second argument is the source value register.

==Availability==
The LGR instruction is 64-bit, and is only available on the 370 series and z/System.  It will cause an opcode exception on the 360 series.

==Operation==
The LGR instruction copies a 64-bit value from the register specified by the second argument to the register specified by the first argument.

Condition codes are not changed.

Register 0 is valid for either register and is not ignored as in some other instructions.

==Exceptions and Faults==
* 360 Series: Opcode Exception
* 370 Series and zSystem: None.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello!

This chapter could have improved some by specifying that _dragShape should be of wkdShape.

It is funny, reading articles like this, you think you are specified everything to do, this is not the case here.

I had to add the inclusion of WKDShape as well.

It really should be a little bit more specific &quot;do this&quot; and &quot;do that&quot; whith what, and where to put it.

All a great tutorial, but it could have improved with some graphics, like class diagrams and such.

'''LH''' - Load Halfword - Opcode 48 - RX format Instruction (32 Bit)

==Format==
:LH 2,N2
:LH 11,106(8,10)

The specific syntax is
:LH ''target register'',''offset''(''index register'',''base register'')
Where the ''offset'', ''index register'' and ''base register'' values will be determined automatically by the assembler if the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/USING|USING]] pseudo-instruction has been used, and the target address label used is within 4096 bytes of the value of some base register.
==Opcode==
{{360 opcode RX|48}}
==Availability==
The LH instruction is available on all models of the 360, 370 and z/System.  

==Operation==
The LH instruction reads a 16-bit integer value from the memory address specified by the argument and puts it in the low 16 bits of the target register specified by the first argument. The remainder of the register is unchanged.

The source argument address must be aligned to a half-word boundary (i.e. 2 bytes) or an exception will occur. The Condition Code field in the Program Status Word is not changed.

==Exceptions and Faults==
* The source address must be within the range of valid memory or an operation exception occurs. 
* The source address must be aligned to a halfword boundary  or an address exception occurs. 
* The storage key for the source address must be the same as the current process (or the process must be privileged with a key of zero) or a memory protect violate exception occurs.

'''LA''' - Load Address - Opcode 41 - RX format Instruction (32 Bit)

==Format==
:LA 2,N2
:LA 11,106(8,10)

The specific syntax is
:LA ''target register'',''offset''(''index register'',''base register'')
If a label is used instead of explicit index and base register and offset, then the ''offset'', ''index register'' and ''base register'' values will be determined automatically by the assembler if the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/USING|USING]] pseudo-instruction has been used, and the target address label used is within 4095 bytes of the value of some base register.

|}

* The first argument is a ''target register'' which value is affected by the instruction.
* The second argument is the address to be resolved.
* The ''base_register'' and ''index_register'' values are 0 to 15.  The offset value is 0 to 4095. If either or both base and index registers are specified as 0, the value of that register is presumed to contain 0.
* This is a 32-bit instruction, and only uses the low 32 bits of the register when a program is running in 64-bit address mode; the high bits remain unchanged.
* Of the 31 bits, bit 0 is always cleared by this instruction. In 24-bit mode; bits 1-7 are also cleared.

==Availability==
The LA instruction is available on all models of the 360, 370 and z/System.  
==Condition code==
This instruction does not alter the condition code.

==Usage==
The LA instruction has three general uses.
* To set a register to an immediate value from 0 to 4095 (use register 0 for the base and index registers and the amount to add as the displacement).
* To add an immediate value from 1 to 4095 to any register except 0, either use register 0 for the index register, and the same register for the base and target registers, or use register 0 as the base register and the same register for the index and target registers, and the amount to add to that register as the displacement.
* To set a register to any value up to 2^31 in 31-bit or 64-bit mode, or 2^24 in 24-bit mode. Use whichever register has the desired amount as the base (or index) register, if there is an additional amount to add, the value in an index (or base) register may be used, and, if desired, this may also be increased by the displacement address.
* If the displacement is 0 and either (1) the base register is 0, and the index and target registers are the same (and are any register except 0), or (2) the index register is 0 and the base and target registers are the same (and any register except 0), the instruction is effectively a no-op (equivalent to an instruction to add 0 to the specified register).
* If the displacement address, base and index registers are all zero, it zeros the target register (although the XR or SR instruction with both arguments the same would be faster and use less memory).

Note that unlike most instructions, the LA instruction is used to place a value into a register; the resulting address does not have to correspond to an actual address and is not checked for validity. Overflow cannot occur as the top bit of the result is always set to 0, and in 24-bit mode, the top 7 bits of the result are set to 0.

The LA instruction ''could'' be used to clear the value of a register by using 0 for the base, index and displacement values; the actual value in register 0 would not be used and the register would be zeroed. However, the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/SR|SR]] or [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/XR|XR]] instruction with the same register number for both arguments will zero a register faster and produces a shorter instruction.

==Operation==
The LA instruction computes either a 31-bit value (if the program is running in 31-bit or 64-bit address mode) or a 24-bit value from the address specified by the second argument and stores it in the register specified by the first argument, clearing the high bit (0) in 31-bit or 64-bit mode, and the high byte (bits 0-7) in 24-bit mode.  The address is computed by using the base-displacement value of the address.  The address value, from 0 to 4095, is added to the value of the contents of the base register (unless it is register 0, then it is presumed to contain zero).  To this is added the value of the contents of the index register (unless it is register 0, then it is also presumed to contain zero). In 31-bit or 64-bit mode, the high bit is forced to 0. In 24-bit mode, the high byte is forced to 0.  This total is then stored in the target register.  This value does not have to be a valid address; while the LA instruction is often used to compute an address, it can be used to set the value of a register, e.g. a way to increment register 1 by 1 is the following:

: LA 1, 1(0,1)
Or to increment register 7 by 5
: LA 7, 5(0,7)

In some cases, the LA instruction is used to create addressing for program segments larger than 4095 bytes, by arranging a second register to point 4096 bytes after the first:&lt;br/&gt;
 ROUTINE  CSECT
          BALR  12,0
          USING *,12,11
          LA    11,4095(0,12)      Register 0 explicitly stated as the index register
          LA    11,1(11)           Register 0 is implied for the Index register
In the above case, register 12 is the base register for the first 4096 bytes of the routine, and register 11 is the base register for the portion of the program above 4096 bytes.

==Exceptions and Faults==
None. The address being generated is not checked for validity, and because in all modes (24-bit, 31-bit or 64-bit), bit 0 is always cleared, overflow cannot occur.

=== Development Cooperation and Knowledge Sharing ===
[[File:Global Agenda.jpg|thumb|The Global Agenda for Development]]
Knowledge sharing is an activity through which information, skills and expertise are exchanged among people or the members of a community or within an organization.  Development actors recognize that knowledge constitutes an essential resource for development and that knowledge sharing is indispensable for networking and advocacy.  Nevertheless, information sharing continues to be a major challenge since many organizations consider their know-how to be a personal strategic asset for keeping a competitive advantage in fund-raising activities.

This handbook, along with the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook|linked audiovisual media]], is:
* a testimony of the beauty and power of knowledge sharing,
* an action that contrasts the ideologies of the clash of civilizations,
* a meeting ground for different experiences of social responsibility, 
* a workshop for the renewal of faith, hope and commitment.
The [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda Project|partners]] that help in collecting and distributing the resources of this handbook share a sense of &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Our role as individuals|world citizenship]]&quot;, a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#the positive sum game|positive-sum-game]] approach to inter-community relationships and a vision of our &quot;Earth as a Common Home&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

For those who accept this invitation, welcome on board!

      <comment>/* Aerobic exercise benefits for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Benefits of moderate aerobic exercise on Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis''' ==

=== Background ===
Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease is a degenerative disorder of specific nerve cells of the spinal cord, brain stem and the brain itself that affects the upper and lower parts of the body. Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis is the most common disease in a group of diseases known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND). It is a neurological disease that selectively affects the nerves of the body which are specifically known as motor neurons. Motor neurons are cells that control voluntary muscle action and help us preform everyday actions such as walking, speaking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body. Being a neuron muscular disease, once Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis reaches the majority of neurons there is nothing exercise can do as the patient is completely bed ridden through partial or complete paralysation.&lt;ref&gt;Lui, A.J. and Byl, N.N. (2009) A systematic review of the effect of moderate intensity exercise on function and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Journal of Neurological Physical Therapy 33, 68-87&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Risk and symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
ALS generally strikes patients of middle age (25 to 55) and is more often found in men than women. In the initial stages of ALS symptoms can be so slight that they are often overlooked. The earliest symptoms are weakness and/or muscle atrophy.Yet this can often be disguised if a person does physical activity as they perceive it as just natural fatigue. Other initial symptoms include muscle fasciculation (twitching), cramping or muscle stiffness and slurred or nasal speech. These symptoms can come in any particular order and will depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first. &lt;ref&gt;Lopes de Almeida, J. P., Silvestre, R., Pinto A. C., and de Carvalho, M. (2012) Exercise and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Neurological Sciences 33, 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As symptoms progress each part of the body beginnings slowing down and eventually reaches a parasitic state. From this stage death is inevitable. In recent years more and more neurologists are stating that “Physical inactivity could expose people with ALS to even greater health risks, and exercise in moderation can bring the benefits of exercise while minimizing the risk of worsening their conditions”. When you look into it, there is no stone cold evidence that exercise can actually do damage to patients yet there is evidence for the benefits.


=== Aerobic exercise benefits for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
Exercise is used to improve health, maintain fitness and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation. In relationship to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, moderate aerobic exercise is vital in two important ways. The first way is for prolonging the symptoms from multiplying and the second is for the prevention of the disease all together. Between the years of 1992 and 2011 five major studies where done suggesting that Aerobic exercise played a major role in prolonging of ALS symptoms and the increased quality of life. These studies are as followed:

* '''1992:''' scientist discovered that short moderate aerobic exercise boosted the levels of neurotrophins in the brain. Neurotrophin are a substance of the brain that protects motor neurons and triggers growth of new motor neurons.
* '''1995:''' studys where done in which rats did moderate running exercise each day for one week. It was found that these rats had doubled levels of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor)&lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2000:''' researchers found that increase levels of neurotrophin following moderate aerobic exercise actually helped protect the brain in rats from injury or neuron diseases. &lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2003-2005:''' two groups of rats with ALS were tested. The first group did moderate running exercise over the space of several weeks while the second group did moderate swimming over the same amount of time. Both sets of groups came back with positive results. In the first group it was reported that moderate running actually increased the lifespan of rats with ALS. While in the second group it was found that swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%. &lt;ref&gt;Kirkinezos, I.G, Hernandez, D., Bradley, W.G. and Moraes, C.T (2003) Regular exercise is beneficial to a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Annals of Neurology 53, 804-807&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2011:''' researchers found that aerobic exercise not only increased neurotrophins but had the potential to keep the power on in the motor nerves by increasing the amount of oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Oligodendrocytes are cells of the brain and spinal cord that supply critical energy to mitochondria keeping the energy flowing in distal axon and nerve terminals. They do this by making up the myelin sheath which extends and speeds up the functioning of the neurons.This meant that symptoms decreased and the quality of life increased. &lt;ref&gt; Nave, K.A. (2010) Myelination and the trophic support of long axons. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 11. 275-283 &lt;/ref&gt;

These tests showed that through moderate aerobic exercise both neurotrophins and Oligodendrocytes are increased or maintained allowing for a decrease in the rate of destruction of motor neurons. This meaning that the onset of the diseases was a lot less severe and allows patients to live longer and healthier lives. It is important to note that aerobic exercise does not reverse the disease but only delays the onset.

=== Moderate aerobic exercise activities suited for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis  === 
Moderate aerobic exercise activities are vital when attempting to prolong the onset of ALS, recommeded exercises are:   
* walking
* swimming 
* stationary cycling
It is important that these exercises are all done at 60 to 65% of a persons oxygen output, last no longer than 30 minutes and are partaken at least 3 times a week. This intensity allowed weakened muscles to preform exercise without overworking or damaging them and promotes the increase of protective substances in the brain and spinal cord. By doing this exersice it keeps fast twitch muscles active and oxidates them slowing down the process of atrophy. It also found that patients had significant signs of reduced functional decline and increased post rehabilitation survival. &lt;ref&gt;Neeper, S.A., Goauctemez-Pinilla, F., Choi, J. and cotman, C. (1995) Exercise and neurotrophins. Nature 373, 109&lt;/ref&gt;. While swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%.

=== Further reseach ===
Further research is being done to find out more about the effects of aerobic exercise in ALS patients. Testing still needs to be done on how different intensities may affect the disease and if resistance exercise can play a role. But what we are sure of is that any form of moderate aerobic exercise weather it is swimming, running or cycling can have a positive result rather than no exercise at all. It can increase the neurotrophins and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord allowing for a reduced functional decline and increased survival rate.

      <comment>Adding BookCat to uncategorised page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ideas used in cryptography have been used to create a large number of protocols.

The original application of these ideas was secret hiding --
Alice wanted to send a message to Bob,
but Alice and Bob didn't want anyone else to know exactly what the message said.

More recently, many &quot;cryptographic protocols&quot; have been developed
that do useful things *other* than secret hiding.

Some cryptographic protocols make secret hiding better or more convenient in some way --
* key-agreement protocols such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange
* Message authentication

(FIXME: say something here about commutative ciphers)

Other cryptographic protocols and cryptography-related ideas are used to improve on non-cryptographic systems:
* Early &quot;everyone in favor, hold up their hands while I count&quot; voting systems don't hide any secrets; end-to-end auditable voting systems (which internally use cryptographic ideas) are arguably better.
* mental poker
* convergent encryption
* digital signatures
* version identifiers in Mercurial and git.
* error-detection and error-correction codes.
* the rsync protocol
* verifiable computing
* various ideas for improving (non-secret) email to reduce the amount of spam, such as hashcash, Sender ID, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), etc.

In particular, the first fully homomorphic encryption was announced in 2009 by Craig Gentry.
It is widely expected that homomorphic encryption will make it relatively easy to do things that were previously considered impossible or infeasible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phishing is sending an e-mail that legitimately to be from an organization or (bank, PayPal, eBay…) but is indeed from a fake a phisher. This e-mail activity is to try to receive private personnel information such as log in passwords bank account information and so on. These e-mails will sometimes have links in them to click on and bring you to a seemingly legitimate web site. Instead of an official web site you are actually being brought to the phishers web site. This is referred to as web site spoofing. To get the victim to click on the link is usually done by saying something to the effect of their accounts needs to be updated. Many individuals can become prey to this type of e-mail. To stay protected from this type of activity it is important to be aware of any e-mail stating that they are from a certain company. It’s best to be safe and check with the company by phone rather than click through a web site link in an e-mail. It’s also important to find the phone number of the company in a different place other than the e-mail you just received. These are just a few tips to help keep your information safe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Importance of Business Writing Skills ==
Communication skills, including writing, are one of the most important transferrable skills that students should learn when they are in college.&lt;ref&gt;Importance of Good Writing Skills in the Workplace ''[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-good-writing-skills-workplace-10931.html]''&lt;/ref&gt; Most professions require high competency in written communication. It could be a chance for one to shine or hinder one's success. With emails, memos, letters, texts and even Tweets, most people spend a fair amount of time at work communicating via the written word. Whether you are messaging a colleague, writing to your manager, crafting the company newsletter, or writing a press release to the media, your writing skills can boost or hinder your career easily, even if you do not have a “writing” profession. Basically, writing skills make a difference in how you come across.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through business writing exercises, students learn to convey messages and ideas in a concise way. Concise and self-explanatory messages help increase productivity at the workplace as they save time by eliminating the need to ask for further instructions. Good writing reflects not only the credibility of the writer but also projects a positive image for the company. 

== Academic Writing vs. Business Writing ==
Unlike academic writing, where ideas are explored and length is encouraged, business writing needs to be clear and concise. Business writing takes place in many forms, as categorized in internal and external communications; the major differences between academic writing and business writing are as followed:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.instructionalsolutions.com/blog/bid/61931/Business-Writing-vs-Academic-Writing&lt;/ref&gt;
# Writing at work focuses on problem solving. 
# Work-related writing targets multiple audiences with different perspectives. 
# Writing at work may be read by unknown readers. 
# Writing produced at work can be used indefinitely and can be used in legal proceedings. 
# The format for work documents varies greatly from the format for academic documents. 
Typically, business writing are taught in the English department with by professors or technical professionals. The course can be taught as undergraduate lower level coursework with emphasis on practical work or writing projects. 

== Writing Across the Workplace ==
Communication in the workplace may be categorized into internal and external purposes. Depending on the nature of work, these two categories demand different writing styles and structures. Therefore, students should be taught to identify the elements of the communication before they begin writing. 
* Writer: The encoder or the party that creates a message through writing
* Audience: The decoder or the party that receives a message and interprets it accordingly
* Medium: The channel in which a message is communicated (examples: print, electronic, broadcast)
* Noise: The interference that could potentially distort the transmission of a message
* Context: The circumstance under which a message is created, including the writer's and audience's frame of references 

=== Internal Communications ===
Internal communications is the function responsible for the dissemination of information within an organization. Memo, business letters, internal publications, e-mails, internal announcements and promotions, etc. are examples of internal communications. Modern communication technologies today have greatly enhanced the feasibility of communication in the workplace by allowing real-time and asynchronous writing. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to work with others when writing for internal purposes. Students can experience collaborative writing in the classroom using MUD (Multi-user Domains) or open-access web applications such as Google Drive and Wiki. Following is an example of in-class activity that incorporates collaborative writing:

==== Lesson in Collaborative Writing and Editing ====
[[File:Students in a computer lab.jpg|thumbnail|right|Students write synchronously in collaborative exercise.]]
This copyediting exercise needs to be conducted in classroom with sufficient computers for all students, or students can bring their own laptop or tabloid computers to class. Break students into groups of five. You may choose a MUD application that you are more comfortable working with. For explanation purposes, Google Docs is used as the collaborative tool in this activity. Ask students to create an account on Google if they have not already have a user account. You should have several sample memos that are already saved on your Google Drive. Depending on the number of students in class, you need to have at least one memo for each group. Use the sharing feature on Google Docs to allow access for students to edit the sample memo assigned to their groups. Ask students to utilize the chat and comment features to communicate synchronously as they edit the text together. When the activity is over, conduct a class discussion about the pros and cons in collaborative writing practices and how to maximize productivity through collaborative writing. 

=== External Communications ===
Corporate branding, public relations, investor relations, marketing and publicity, advertising, sales, promotions, event announcements, media and press releases are practices of external communications. Writing for external communications is usually audience-directed and aims to build corporate identity. Another objective of such writing is to sell a product or service provided by the company. Students should practice persuasive writing that fits into various media, including radio, television, press, and the Internet. The following is an activity that can be used to teach business writing pertaining to external communications:

==== Lesson in Marketing Writing ====
For this exercise, students can work individually or in small groups. Give students an item (it can be a stationary, electronic gadget, or other items you can find in the classroom) and tell them to write an advertisement that sells it in a magazine. Students should identify the target market/audience, determine selling strategy, develop copy/text, and provide explanations for their creative plan. Students can use online open-source programs such as [http://picnik.com/ Picnik] and [http://pixlr.com/editor/ Pixlr] to create marketing materials for the item they are selling. Have students vote on their most favorite creative work by the end of the session. The purpose of this activity is to let student explore the marketing writing process and experience writing for external communications.

=== Writing for Crisis Communication ===
Crisis communication can be for either internal or external purposes. It is sometimes considered a sub-specialty of both the public relations profession and business continuity that is designed to protect and defend an individual, company, or organization facing a public challenge to its reputation.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_communication&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for crisis communication should focus on communicating urgency and possible solutions to react upon. Students can be given a problem situation whereby they plan a mock strategic outline through writing. 

== Stay Professional ==
Students tend to sway from their objective when they are not adept in business writing. Aside from practicing to write with clarity and completeness, teachers should remind students to reserve some acts of professional courtesy in their writing. As business writing is increasingly getting into shorthand fashion, students must learn to avoid sloppiness in their writing. It can be troublesome if messages become too abrupt or incomplete and thus causing misunderstanding. Even if it was an email, the writer should take time to check spellings and write in complete sentences. Whenever necessary, graphical elements can help to better explain a message than lengthy paragraphs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Background =

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a class of diseases that impact on the normal functioning of the heart and/or blood vessels. CVD is comprised of many diseases including;

*Ischaemic heart disease.
*Stroke.
*Coronary heart disease.
*Myocardial infarction.
*Hypertension.
*Rheumatic heart disease&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

CVD is the the leading cause of death within Australia, resulting in 32% of deaths nationally during 2007-2008 with the majority of these deaths  a result of Ischaemic heart disease and stroke. 3.5 million Australians are currently living with one or more CVD conditions and prevalence increases significantly with increasing age. 19% of 45-54 year olds compared to 62% of 75+ years old are currently living with CVD&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Non-modifiable risk factors such as age and family history are strong predictors of CVD. Modifiable risk factors include; smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet and obesity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.


==Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Disease==


Increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary behaviour will reduce a individual's risk of Cardiovascular disease. A combination of aerobic and resistance training completed with moderate intensity will assist in:
*Decreasing fat mass.
*Increased cardiovascular adaptations.
*Increased strength and functional capacity.
*Increased quality of life. 
*Greater prospect of exercise program adherence&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Sedentary Behaviour=


Increased sedentary behaviour has been shown to increase CVD mortality risk, with a strong association between time spent sitting and mortality. The highest mortality rate is demonstrated in sedentary individuals who are also obese. Decreased glucose tolerance, alterations to lipo-protein lipase activity and cardiac changes are related to an increased CVD mortality rate resulting from sedentary behaviour&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Aerobic Training=


Aerobic training can lead to adaptations within the cardiovascular system that help protect itself from CVD. Aerobic exercise decreases body fat, decreases plasma triglycerides and increases cardiac output. Aerobic training adaptations are highly beneficial for decreasing CVD risk and reversing known risk factors such obesity and high blood pressure&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Resistance Training=


Resistance training develops strength, endurance and physical capacity. These benefits are very important in older populations as it allows maintenance of independence, decreased disability and a greater quality of life. Resistance training also adds variety to an exercise program which can help facilitate adherence&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Resistance training has been indicated to be safe for all populations if correct loads, exercise selection and techniques are used. Light loads and utilising machines are encouraged in the initial stages of the exercise program to allow development of basic strength and technical understanding of movements&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,6&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Potential Complications=


Extremely vigorous exercise without prior experience can be detrimental to cardiovascular health in individuals with moderate to high risk levels. Myocardial infarction may be induced due to immense cardiovascular stress&lt;sup&gt;3,7&lt;/sup&gt;.

Resistance training with heavy loads also increases blood pressure and stresses the cardiovascular system. Correct breathing and lifting techniques assist in minimising blood pressure increases during resistance training&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Physical Activity Recommendations=


Medical advice should be obtained from a GP prior to commencement of a physical activity regime. Medical screening can determine a individual's CVD risk and the appropriate level of physical activity intensity. Medical clearance should then be passed on to the supervising fitness professional.  

Training should be predominantly aerobic based to maximise cardiovascular adaptations with an additional resistance training component for strength and functional capacity development. Programs should be tailored to individual needs based on age, current fitness level and risk factors.  


&lt;big&gt;Aerobic training&lt;/big&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Frequency''' || 3-5 sessions per week.
|-
| '''Intensity''' || Moderate intensity activities.
|-
| '''Time''' || Aim for 30 minutes or more each day (can be completed throughout the day).
|-
| '''Type''' || Brisk walking ideal for initial training before moving on to moderate intensity activities such as jogging. Non-weight bearing exercises such as swimming and cycling for obese. 
|}



&lt;big&gt;Resistance training&lt;/big&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Frequency''' || 1-2 sessions per week.
|-
| '''Intensity''' || 1-2 sets, 10+ repetitions, 8-12 exercises per session. Load of around 40% 1RM.
|-
| '''Time''' || 30-45 minutes per session.
|-
| '''Type''' || Alternate upper body and lower body exercises to minimise fatigue ensuring appropriate movement and breathing techniques are used. 
|}


Individuals at higher risk should be supervised by a fitness professional and sessions should not be undertaken alone. Medications should be continued and the supervising fitness professional should be aware of current medication use. Training in extremely hot conditions should also be avoided.

Training should be ceased immediately if the individual feels shortness of breath, light-headedness, chest pain, chest tightness or an irregular heartbeat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=OSI Model=
The Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model is a theoretical model of networking that organizes network functions into seven layers (physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application) and specifies the communication interfaces between the OSI model layers and network endpoints utilizing various protocols.  Although the model is theoretical the seven layers provide standardized functions that take place at each layer. The model is designed so that a layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.[[File:Osi-model.png|thumb|OSI Model]]

==Layers==

===Layer 1: physical layer===
The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. In particular, it defines the relationship between a device and a transmission medium, such as a copper or optical fiber cable|fiber optical cable. This includes the layout of Lead (electronics)|pins, voltages, line Characteristic impedance|impedance, cable specifications, signal timing, network hub|hubs, repeaters, network card|network adapters, host adapter|host bus adapters (HBA used in storage area networks) and more.

===Layer 2: data link layer===
The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer. Originally, this layer was intended for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint media, characteristic of wide area media in the telephone system. Local area network architecture, which included broadcast-capable multi-access media, was developed independently of the ISO work in IEEE 802|IEEE Project 802. IEEE work assumed sublayer-ing and management functions not required for WAN use. In modern practice, only error detection, not flow control using sliding window, is present in data link protocols such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), and, on local area networks, the IEEE 802.2 Logical link control|LLC layer is not used for most protocols on the Ethernet, and on other local area networks, its flow control and acknowledgment mechanisms are rarely used. Sliding window flow control and acknowledgment is used at the transport layer by protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol|TCP, but is still used in niches where X.25 offers performance advantages.

===Layer 3: network layer===
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network (in contrast to the data link layer which connects hosts within the same network), while maintaining the quality of service requested by the transport layer. The network layer performs network routing functions, and might also perform fragmentation and reassembly, and report delivery errors. router (computing)|Routers operate at this layer, sending data throughout the extended network and making the Internet possible. This is a logical addressing scheme – values are chosen by the network engineer. The addressing scheme is not hierarchical.

===Layer 4: transport layer===
The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred.

===Layer 5: session layer ===
The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex, half-duplex, or Simplex communication|simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls. On this level, Inter-Process (computing)|Process communication happen (SIGHUP, SIGKILL, End Process, etc.).

===Layer 6: presentation layer===
The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the higher-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation service data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units, and passed down the stack.

===Layer 7: application layer===
The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means that both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application-layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. When determining resource availability, the application layer must decide whether sufficient network or the requested communication exist. In synchronizing communication, all communication between applications requires cooperation that is managed by the application layer.

=TCP/IP Model=
The developers of the TCP/IP protocol suite created their own architectural model to help describe its components and functions.  This model is similar to the OSI model except it is a four layer standard compared to the seven layer of the OSI model.  Because the four layers account for all 7 layers of functions in the OSI model, each layers function is not as strictly defined in this model.[[File:Application Layer.png|thumb|Model Comparisons]]

Worldwide, over one-third of [[Exercise_as_it_relates_to_Disease/The_benefits_of_exercise_for_reducing_symptoms_of_polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_(PCOS)|reproductive age women]] are obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2)and another 29% are overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2). Once a woman is pregnant, both maternal and fetal risks are increased by high maternal BMI. Pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality are higher in obese women than in normal-weight women &lt;ref&gt;

==Workload of Exercise==

During the first trimester of pregnancy, it is vital to avoid laying flat on the back or standing in a particular spot for a long period of time. This may result in blood flow restriction to the foetus. High intensity exercise should also be avoided as it will increase core body temperature, increasing temperature of the foetus. However, light walks, aqua aerobics, light strength and conditioning exercises is recommended to aid back to accommodate with weight gain during the second and third trimester. 

Exercise intensity may be increased during the second and third trimester. 30 minute training sessions 3 times a week, during weeks 11 to 14 on the borg scale is said to be optimal. Heart rate is not an accurate measure of exercise intensity as basal heart rate will increase during pregnancy. Increasing intensity of the exercise will not always be beneficial to the mother or the foetus. Knowledge on optimal exercise routines and intensity for each trimester of the pregnancy should be obtained. Recent studies have shown training too often may result to giving birth to a smaller sized baby. Training at too high intensities may put too much stress on joints and pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor muscles supports the weight of the unborn baby and controls urination and bowl movements. Extra pressure can lead to urine being passed involuntarily because of a more relaxed pelvic floor.

== Exercises to avoid while pregnant ==
During pregnancy, avoid sports and activities with increased risk of falling. 
include:
* Contact sports or activities that carry a risk of falling (such as trampolining, rollerblading, downhill snow skiing, horse riding and basketball)
* Competition sports – depending on the stage of pregnancy, the level of competition and your level of fitness
* 
* After about the fourth month of pregnancy, exercises that involve lying on your back – the weight of the baby can slow the return of blood to the heart. Try to modify these exercises by lying on the side.
* 
* In the later stages of pregnancy, activities that involve jumping, frequent changes of direction and excessive stretching (such as gymnastics).
* 
* If you're not sure whether a particular activity is safe during pregnancy, check with your healthcare professional.

=== '''What is Cerebral Palsy?''' ===
Cerebral Palsy is an umbrella term given to a group of disorders that affect movement[1]. It is a physical disability caused by an abnormality or non-progressive lesion which has damaged the developing brain, usually prior to birth and although it is a permanent condition it is not unchanging[1].

=== '''Possible Causes''' ===
:* Complications at birth, asphyxia (lack of oxygen)&lt;ref&gt;Cerebral Palsy Alliance; date visited 20/10/12; http://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Combination of events causing injury to a babies developing brain[1]
:* In most cases, brain damage occurs in the uterus or before 1 month old[1]
:* Stroke most common cause in babies after 1 month old[1]
:* Stroke occurs spontaneously or from surgical or heart problems[1]

=== '''Diagnosis''' ===
Cerebral Palsy is often very difficult to diagnose and generally requires repeated tests before it can be officially diagnosed[1]. Parents are usually the ones who first become aware that something is wrong when their child is not reaching the established [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stages developmental milestones]. Once alerted doctors will take and carefully examine a full medical history of the child and then monitor the child's movements and muscle tone&lt;ref&gt;How is Cerebral Palsy Diagnosed?, last updated 09/2009, viewed 17/10/12, http://www.mychildwithoutlimits.org/?page_id=04AECCDA-C111-5304-45D35BF814B7F724&amp;r=1&lt;/ref&gt;. Observation of the babies [http://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/about-cerebral-palsy/basic-guide-to-cerebral-palsy/diagnosing-cerebral-palsy/general-movements-assessment general movements], whether they have very relaxed, loose muscle or tight, stiff muscle and if they have any postural preferences will help with the diagnosis. Once this has been done the child must be monitored to insure it is not a more serious progressive disorder before the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy can be made[2].

=== '''Prevention Methods''' ===
Currently there is no total way to prevent or cure cerebral palsy[1], however two methods have been developed to reduce the severity of cerebral palsy:
:* Magnesium Sulphate: given to pregnant women when they are at risk of having a pre-term birth[1]. This can help protect the unborn child from brain damage which can lead to cerebral palsy[1].
:* Cooling Cap: This is used when new born babies that have suffered brain damage, due to lack of oxygen before birth[1]. The cooling cap aims to reduce the impact of the brain damage[1].

=== '''Treatment''' ===
There is no clear treatment for cerebral palsy, however research development in brain plasticity has given hope to those with the condition[1]. The brain's plasticity allows for injured areas of the brain to be taken over by another section, by compensating for the injured area[1]. In the future it is hopeful that gene and stem cell therapy may be used, even before a baby is born to repair damaged cells of the brain that would generally lead to cerebral palsy[1].

=== '''Recommendations''' ===
==== Physical Therapy ====
Studies have shown that resistive exercises could be positive in muscle strengthening in cases where muscle weakness causes dysfunction. Training was found to increase strength and improve motor activity in individuals with cerebral palsy&lt;ref&gt;K. W. Krigger, M.D, M.E.D; Cerebral Palsy: An Overview&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Resistance Exercises ====
Resistance training may aid in the amount of knee crouch during gait by focusing on strengthening the quadriceps. A study showed that children with cerebral palsy were significantly weaker in the quadriceps and hamstrings than those without&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Damiano, C. L. Vaughan, M. E. Abel; Muscle response to heavy resistance exercise in children with spastic cerebral palsy&lt;/ref&gt;. By following a training program, the quadriceps strength was improved at all three angles of knee flexion as a result of the resistance training[4]. Quadricpes weakness was shown to be major contributor in crouch gait, and by strengthening the quadrcipes with resistive exercises may contribute to the treatment of cerebral palsy[4].

In order to have normal motor control, a certain amount of strength must be present, individuals with cerebral palsy lack this strength and as a result, their motor function is affected&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Damiano, M. F. Abel; 1998; Functional Outcomes of strength training in spastic cerebral palsy&lt;/ref&gt;. Increasing strength on the lower limbs was shown to positively affects gait and increase free walking velocity[5]. Continuing a training program focusing on strength in the lower limbs would be beneficial to improving walking cadence and velocity[5]. A strength training program could enhance the motor function of those with cerebral palsy, focusing on the larger muscle groups first, such as the quadriceps and hamstrings to enahance the ability to walk.

==== Aquatic Exercises ====
Aquatic exercises may be very beneficial for individuals with cerebral palsy. This is due to the buoyancy of the water minimising the influence of gravity and providing more postural support, as well as reducing the levels of joint loading and impact on the joints, providing a gentler environment for individuals with cerebral palsy&lt;ref&gt;M. Kelly, J. Darrah; 2007; Aquatic Exercise for Children with Cerebral Palsy&lt;/ref&gt;. The added benefit of aquatic exercises is the resistive forces of buoyancy and viscous drag, giving a variety of aerobic and strengthening activities that can be modified to accomodate different levels of motor function to people with cerebral palsy[6]. Although there are positive elements to aquatic exercise for people with cerebral palsy, there are factors that must be considered before exercise can begin[6]. They are:
:* Adequate intensity, duration, and frequency (this will depend on this severity of the condition)[6]
:* Will a group environment be more beneficial than training individually[6]
:* Pool environment is suitable and safe[6]

=== '''Safety Considerations''' ===
People with Cerebral Palsy are highly susceptible to falls and in some cases seizures. Take these points into consideration while exercising:
:* Ensure there is adequate support available in the area such as hand rails or walkers
:* Remove any objects from the area which may present as a hazards, such as benches and weights
:* Take extra care if walking through wet, slippery areas such as around a pool

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Osteoporosis: The Silent Disease =
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes the bones to become brittle and fragile due to a reduction in density and quality of bone matrix. These changes cause a large increase in the risk of fractures, there are often no signs of osteoporosis until the first fracture. This is why it is referred to as &quot;The Silent Disease&quot;. Osteoporosis is a disease often seen among the elderly. This is due to the changes in bone remodeling as we age. During early adulthood bone matrix is at its most dense, as we age bone matrix is absorbed while new matrix is formed, this is normally an even equation. Unfortunately as we age this equation can become unbalanced leading to a greater pace of bone absorption compared to the formation of new matrix, this is the cause of osteoporosis. 

Men and women over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of osteoporosis and while it is a disease associated with age it is still possible to develop at a younger age. Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a Bone Mineral Denisty (BMD) test. The most commonly used BMD test is DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) which is similar to an X-ray but can detect changes in bone loss. A list of all types of tests can be found in the recommended readings. Osteoporosis is diagnosed against a set of threshold values created by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Osteoporosis is diagnosed when a person’s BMD is equal to or more than 2.5 standard deviations below this value.  
== Connection Between Resistance Training and Osteoporosis ==

Resistance Training or weight lifting has been shown to provide benefits to many different types of athletes in regards to strength, power, endurance and hypertrophy gains although is not of common practice in the older population. It is a type of training normally undertaken by the younger population with association to specific sport development programs. Wolff's law states that stress or mechanical loading applied to the bone via the muscle and tendons has a direct effect on bone formation and remodeling. While resistance training has been shown to have an improvement on various athletic performances it can also extend into benefits with everyday life activities.

The goal of resistance training in regards to osteoporosis is to maintain or increase BMD and therefore reduce the chance of suffering a fracture. Resistance training has been shown to improve BMD in site specific areas and should therefore be targeted at areas that reduce the like hood of falls. Targeted muscle areas should include all major muscle groups of both lower and upper extremities in order to help increase BMD of all major bones such as hips and the lumbar spine which are at high risk of fractures and if fractured can lead to devastating consequences such as surgery, loss of function and death.

== Physical Activity Guidelines to Prevent/Manage Osteoporosis ==

When prescribing exercise programs for individuals with high risk of fractures such as those suffering from osteoporosis, with particular emphasis on the elderly, there are certain precautions and tests that should be conduced before undertaking exercise in avoid unforeseen calamities.
 
==== Precautions &amp; Safety Concerns ====

* Ensure the individual has sought advice from a medical professional and has been cleared to undertake the program.
* Make sure the individual is under the supervision of a trained instructor to ensure proper use and technique of equipment and exercises are taking place.
* Reduce the risk factors of falls associated in physical activity environments such as dim lights, scattered objects and loose carpet or flooring. 
* Depending on the additional needs of the individual in regards to vision and hearing the use of trochanteric pads may need to be arranged.
* Ensure that any medication taken will not effect or cause risk factors when physical activity is undertaken.

==== Recommended Physical Activity ====
When designing exercise programs for individuals with osteoporosis special attention and awareness of their like hood to suffer fractures needs to be kept in mind. Any resistance training session should start with a warm up and end with a cool down while incorporating some form of flexibility training. Increases in flexibility has been heavily linked with reduced falls risk. 

Resistance training should be undertaken at a minimum of two sessions per week containing a variety of 8 to 10 different exercises per session. Three sets of each exercise should be performed with 8 to 12 repetitions. It is recommended that the individual begins the program starting at 50% of the 1 repetition max with the goal of obtaining  85% of their 1 repetition max through repetitions. Despite these recommendations the goal of any program should be long term adherence to the program, which will have the greatest benefit overall.

[[w:Phytopathology|Phytopathology]] is the study of of plant diseases.

==Root rot==
'''Root rot''' is a condition that occurs, because of poor aeration and microbial, especially water mold problems. Dead roots allow rot to spread throughout the plant. This can be a result of inadequate oxygenation, sanitation and stagnation. It is usually lethal, since there is no certain effective treatment. The effectiveness of predator fungus remains in question.

The excess water makes it very difficult for the roots to get the air that they need, causing them to decay.

Root rot is commonly caused by members of the [[w:water mold|water mold]] genus ''[[w:Phytophthora|Phytophthora]]''. Perhaps the most aggressive is [[w:Phytophthora cinnamomi|''P. cinnamomi'']]. [[w:Spore|Spore]] from root rot causing agents do contaminate other plants, but the rot cannot take hold unless there is adequate moisture. Spores are not only airborne, but are also carried by insects and other [[w:arthropod|arthropod]].

A plant with root rot will not normally survive, but can often be [[w:Plant propagation|propagated]] so it will not be lost completely. Plants with root rot should be removed and destroyed.

Root rot can occur in [[w:hydroponics|hydroponic]] applications, if the water is not properly [[w:water aeration|aerated]]. This is usually accomplished by use of an air pump with an air diffuser, or by allowing water to drain away from appropriate hydroculture systems frequently on a time cycle. Problems associated with poor water aeration were principal reasons for the development of aeroponics.

'''Oxygenation''' is important to the [[w:sustainability|sustainability]] of a hydroculture [[w:ecosystem|ecosystem]]. Plant roots, aerobic bacteria, hydrophytes, fish and or other aerobic organisms and tissue require oxygenation.

Insufficient oxygen ([[w:hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]) may occur in water or substrate, creating a hazardous environment for [[w:aerobic organism|aerobic organism]]s and tissue. Deoxygenation increases the relative population of [[w:anaerobic organism|anaerobic organism]]s such as certain [[w:bacteria|bacteria]], resulting in root rot, [[w:fish kill|fish kill]]s and other adverse events. Increasing the concentration of aerobic conditions provides a a healthy hydroculture [[w:balance of nature|ecosystem]].

Water aeration is required in water bodies that suffer from anoxic conditions. Aeration can be achieved by using an air pump with a diffuser, or by surface agitation from a fountain or spray-like device to allow for oxygen exchange at the surface and the release of noxious gases such as carbon dioxide, methane or hydrogen sulfide.

[[w:Oxygen saturation|Dissolved oxygen (DO)]] is a major contributor to water quality. Not only do fish and other aquatic animals need it, but oxygen breathing aerobic bacteria decompose organic matter. When oxygen concentrations become low, anoxic conditions may develop which can decrease the ability of the water body to support life.

==Hypoxia==
'''[[w:Hypoxia (environmental)|Hypoxia]]''', or '''oxygen depletion''', is a phenomenon that occurs in aquatic environments as dissolved oxygen ('''DO'''; molecular oxygen dissolved in the water) becomes reduced in concentration to a point where it becomes detrimental to aquatic organisms living in the system. Dissolved oxygen is typically expressed as a percentage of the oxygen that would dissolve in the water at the prevailing temperature and salinity (both of which affect the solubility of oxygen in water; see [[w:oxygen saturation|oxygen saturation]] and [[w:underwater|underwater]]).  An aquatic system lacking dissolved oxygen (0% saturation) is termed anaerobic, [[w:Reducing environment|reducing]],  or '''[[w:Anoxic waters|anoxic]]'''; a system with low concentration&amp;mdash;in the range between 1 and 30% saturation&amp;mdash;is called '''hypoxic''' or '''dysoxic'''. Most fish cannot live below 30% saturation. A &quot;healthy&quot; aquatic environment should seldom experience less than 80%. The '''exaerobic''' zone is found at the boundary of anoxic and hypoxic zones.

Here are ways of infusing air into the nutrient solution and aquaponic tank. Also, keeping the plant roots suspended above the nutrient solution is beneficial, since there is a limit to the amount of oxygen saturation that can be contained in water.

===Fountains===
Fountains aerate by pulling water from the surface of the water and propelling it into the air.

This process utilizes air-water contact to transfer oxygen. As the water is propelled into the air, it breaks into small droplets. Collectively, these small droplets have a large [[w:surface area|surface area]] through which oxygen can be transferred. Upon return, these droplets mix with the rest of the water and thus transfer their oxygen back to the ecosystem.

Fountains are a popular method of surface aerators because of the aesthetic appearance that they offer. However, most fountains are unable to produce a large area of oxygenated water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;Tucker, Craig. &quot;Pond Aeration.&quot; [https://srac.tamu.edu/index.cfm/event/getFactSheet/whichfactsheet/183/ Pond Aeration SRAC Factsheet 3007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine bubble aeration===
[[Image:Fine Bubble Diffuser (Tube).jpg|right|thumb]]
Fine bubble aeration is an efficient way to transfer oxygen into water.
Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These bubbles are known as ''fine bubbles''. The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/conservation/lake-notes/lake-aeration.pdf| format=PDF| title=Lake Aeration and Circulation| publisher= Illinois Environmental Protection Agency| accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine bubble diffused aeration is able to maximize the surface area of the bubbles and thus transfer more oxygen into water per bubble. Additionally, smaller bubbles take more time to reach the surface so not only is the surface area maximized but so are the number of seconds each bubble spends in the water, allowing it more time to transfer oxygen to the water. As a general rule, smaller bubbles and a deeper release point will generate a greater oxygen transfer rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taparhudee, Wara 2002&quot;&gt;Taparhudee, Wara. &quot;Applications of Paddle Wheel Aerators and Diffused-Air System in Closed Cycle Shrimp Farm System.&quot; 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, almost all of the oxygen dissolved into the water from an air bubble occurs when the bubble is being formed. Only a negligible amount occurs during the bubbles transit to the surface of the water. This is why an aeration process that makes many small bubbles is better than one that makes fewer larger ones. The breaking up of larger bubbles into smaller ones also repeats this formation and transfer process. &lt;ref&gt;http://users.vcnet.com/rrenshaw/do.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the drawbacks to fine bubble aeration is that the membranes of ceramic diffusers can sometimes clog and must be cleaned in order to keep them working at their optimum efficiency. Also, they do not possess the ability to mix as well as other aeration techniques, such as coarse bubble aeration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;/&gt;

===Drain===
In certain types of hydroculture, such as [[w:Ebb and flow|flood drain systems]], water can be cycled to frequently drain away from the hydroculture system. Plant roots suspended in air provides them aeration that can not be accomplished by allowing plant roots to be saturated in water.

==Measurement==
{{See|w:Cubic feet per minute}}&lt;!--oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE)--&gt;
In [[w:water|aquatic]] environments, '''oxygen saturation''' is a relative measure of the amount of [[w:oxygen|oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dissolved in the water.  Supersaturation can sometimes be harmful for organisms and cause [[w:decompression sickness|decompression sickness]]. '''Dissolved oxygen''' ('''DO''') is measured in standard solution units such as millilitres O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter (ml/L), [[w:Mole (unit)|millimoles]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter (mmol/L), milligrams O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter (mg/L) and moles O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per cubic meter (mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  For example, in freshwater under atmospheric pressure at 20°C, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation is 9.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

Information systems in the consumer industry: a customer approach



Franco Miotto

'''''''''Introduction'''





This work is addressed to everyone who asks himself what will be, in the near future, the information needs for the consumer industry. This paper is thus addressed to people working in information technology, marketing, organization or general management. Their interest will be over the whole book and, particularly, in the chapters regarding the general objective and solutions architecture for the industry and retail environment.

This works derives from various personal experiences out of which I chose the two real cases which are presented in the initial chapters: in both cases the real problem was to shift the company information focus from the support of internal processes to the analysis and evaluation of the market scenario in which the companies were acting.

One of the problems I had to cope while doing this job is to be sure to use a methodology which would help me taking into consideration every part of the problem, not forgetting any aspect. 

The method is one of the aims of the book.

From a presentation point of view, I decided to start from the real cases and then get to the abstraction, not vice versa; it seems to me easier to understand. This is the reason why the case studies are quoted initially; they should help the reader to face the more “formal” discussions with an operational attitude, not as just “principia”.



Generally I think that, after the pure automation phase (accounting, MRP etc.), information technology will need to help industries to approach the complete cycle of customer needs. This will mean taking into consideration processes with a very little syntactic content but very common: informational unstructured scenarios. I think that these processes are the one that will give us some better prediction information models and also improve our operational and control tools.



I am sure that his work has plenty of ingenuities, methodological and language mistakes but, as I found no literature on these topics, I decided to use it as a request for help so that we can make a better service to our general “customer”.

= A case study of reengineering of information systems – industry. =



'''The company''': this case history is about a middle sized industry in the market of apparel and fashion.

The total business is fairly split between production of fabric and underwear, especially beach wear.

The company was historically a weaving site and the apparel part was created to fill the period of the year when fabric production was low. 

The company was created by a single person, a fairly typical situation, and grew up on such a one-person organizational schema. As time passed and markets changed, this model showed its limits and the whole company was suffering poor sales. Everybody was feeling that something new was needed but there was no clear model to follow or copy. The company was slowly losing all its assets: market as well as culture, including human expertise in management, control and operations.

The market: as you might have guessed the main part of the customers belong to two different categories:

# Other companies buying fabric
# Retailers buying underwear and beachwear.

We are thus talking about two different classes of customers with two different sales channels (direct sales vs. sales agents) and different habits. Geographically the company was selling mainly in Italy with little or no foreign turnaround.

From the “marketing” point of view the two parts had a completely different approach:

# The “fabric” department had very little “brand awareness” as the product was thought for a technical market  where the customers are specialists
# The “underwear” department had a definite need for “brand recognition” as this is a large part of the final sale.

The existing information system: as it often happens the actual IT was the result of many years overlapping without the possibility of a real radical rethinking. This was due to two major reasons:

Any radical reorganization of the IT system would have meant discussing the real essence of the company both in scopes and in structure

The IT manager did not have the organizational strength and will to pursue such a task, a job which would have meant criticizing actual high class managers.

The whole situation was also worsened by the fact that the new line of business (“the underwear”) started as a result of another company acquisition. 

All of these factors lead to the existence of two different systems, almost non compatible and with double costs in terms of maintenance and development; worse of all the existence of two technical worlds created the idea that two different companies were acting and that no synergies were possible.

Control system was also a problem as the two systems used different coding and taxonomy so a third system had to exist to aggregate the final data.

Economical perspectives: the international market context and production methods were driving the company to a slow decline in spite of local situation like crisis of recoveries. The whole business model had to be redesigned and the IT was a problem for this. 

First of all the company needed to understand what was important and what was not; this information  was not in the IT capabilities as the system was the image of the company situation and it could not merge internal information with external signals also because people working in it was too busy in getting it going on the operational side.



'''The turn point''' of the situation came when a new CEO was appointed. He decided to analyze every process to create a more elastic and homogeneous company structure. This decision put the top manager in a very delicate position: he could have been the successful innovator, the visionary leader or the excuse for a failure. Particularly in one-man company (level 2 of the Greiner model) product and direct processes are so deeply tangled that any structure variation is seen as an “offense” to the history of the enterprise and these changes are not considered as rational necessities for the company health. Service processes, and IT especially, are not felt as “communication needs” as this job was done by the founder as a physical person. Obviously we all know that is one of the deepest reasons why that communication model (the one-man company) cannot raise over a certain dimension and therefore cannot gain certain dimensional efficiencies.  



With the help of an advisor the new CEO has looked into the problem of updating the IT system and his first problem was to decide which kind of approach was to use:

'''The content approach''': this is the most common approach and it start from defining the typical parameters connected to:

* Technology situation: both technical and functional (HW, SW, user requests coverage etc.)
* Consultancy situation: both related to the existence of “best practices” in the field and to the presence of players (consultancy firms) available
* Project content: typically you tend to copy the actual requirement schema because it is what users ask for
* Timing: months to years horizons
* Objective: to a have a more flexible and usable platform; an updated environment.

'''The functional approach''': this approach starts from a different point of view: “we want to improve customer service” where “the customer” is both the internal user but mainly the external sales customer as this last one certifies the company in the market. So, for each process, we it was necessary to define:

* The customer: who is he? (both known and potential)
* The service: what does this mean? product, attention, social needs
* The product: what the expectations of the customer (the standard we want) as a function of reliability, availability, fashion alignment.
* Esteem needs: achievement, attention, recognition 
* Social needs: belonging, recognized interaction
* How do we define and how do we measure these needs?
* How do we acquire these informations?

The main purpose of this approach is to define some quantitative parameters for a business model with particular attention to the idea of “customer service”.



This second approach was really appreciated also for its “push” attitude on people who had somehow lost what the market really asked for, even though this analysis requires, as an assumption, that a customer knows what he wants, a “mature” approach, and this, by itself, is a statement to be demonstrated.

The first real step was then to figure out what the customer real needs were, differentiating them from what were historically thought them to be or from what were perceived by the various intermediate acting agents. The basic idea was to compare which information were in the IT system and which one were needed to be really customer compliant as to decide which way to invest in the general company information system.

On the external customers, the real steps which followed began with

* Identify “representative customer” by the sale force
* Check whether these customers were really representative of the whole internal market by defining the selection criteria for a sample
* Make an interview to “random customer”, “statistically sample customer” and “representative customers”
* Collect their needs and cross table the results.

The beginning was a disaster, the general attitude was:

Sales people: customers are an asset of “my” division; it is only me who should talk to them

Marketing people: the product is “right”; it is the customer who does not understand it (!).

The CEO skill was to be able to maintain the right direction and get everybody to understand that the company could only grow if it would face the real changing world, avoiding closures and blind behaviors; a formal check is something which is in the nature of improving processes.

As a result of this phase it turned out that the important parameter to be fixed was “time-to-market”: both the fabric and the underwear department could not compete with far-east productions in terms of prices so, assuming that quality was perceived as “sufficient” (therefore a correct positioning on the market) the request was for small production quantities which were to be available quickly.

From the company point of view, this meant:

# A better information system connection
# A better relation system between customer and vendor
# A product industrial design which could allow a quicker response
# A different industrial relation management for customer who need products with a long lead time
# A better forecasting and projection system.

This whole analysis was then enlarged to non-covered channels like e-commerce and direct retail.



'''The solution approach: obliterate or improve'''. This question has been raised so many times by the times of Hammer and Davenport and we know that it has no general answer but it must be correctly posted in the real context. This pragmatic approach must also keep into consideration that the smaller the company the more important is the role of individual physical persons which are themselves “organizational customers” with their background of Maslow needs.

Inside the company the process started requesting each key employee how he felt about the idea of “customer” whether internal or external. We then reversed the question and asked everyone how he felt as being a “customer”, which kind of expectations he had, whether fulfilled or not. In this way we arrived to define a map of “needs”. We then matched these “needs” with their coverage both declared (by the function) and perceived (by the customer).

The difficulties we found, at this stage, were essentially two:

* The capacity of “customer”  and “supplier” to estimate the importance and the coverage of problems; aggressive users tent to impose small problems as important mainly to show that were important people while passive persons would adapt to uneasy situations for the sake of peace
* The difficulty in accepting the idea that, being the company a whole system, the total result is the combination of all parts running well and not just a sum of parts each running at its own speed.

The fact that external consultants were involved helped people to question themselves as well as gave the company an external evaluation of specific professional capability.

In this analysis period the IT group showed its greatest limits as it was trying to support individual needs without having the chance of harmonizing the whole system. Individual requests were pushing into specific directions so the general feeling was that of a waste of time and money. From the outside we can say that it was just a representation of the company situation but to the inside this was the excuse for the falling efficiency.





'''The final choice''': as we said the CEO found himself in the middle of 

* The outside world and the its dynamics
* The needs of the internal operators and especially of the owner.

The way he chose included:

* Making the situation clear to everybody including the owner
* Understanding the stakeholder needs and make them the strategic goals
* Formally analyze the market needs
* Define the organizational model including the operational role and responsibility of the stakeholder
* Getting all the human resources through a processes of upgrading their attitude to “customer service”
* Define the instruments to control both the “service” and economic indicators of each department.

As far as the IT department the choice was:

# Simplify the existing reporting processes as much as possible so that the actual technical infrastructure would last some time allowing the company to concentrate on other projects
# Invest very much on instruments related to “company critical” issues like
* Style research
* Product design and management
* Technical product definition
* Market analysis
* CRM
# Define a strategy to clear out the dependence of the company from a few IT people who actually could not be changed and get the user to accept some minor cut in service level as a function of a clearer general view on the whole system. This part was to support the company up to the change of the system in a medium time period (2-3 years), mainly through a process of data and process definition.


= A case study of reengineering of information systems – retail. =
The company:  this case study is about a small-medium sized apparel company retail division. This company, as it often happens, started on the idea of a specific line of products and later approached the retail channel in a naive way.  The retail story began with the need of liquidating the company surplus in a company outlet; this was not enough so the company approached the outlets circuit. At this point it did happen that the product offer was not balanced to make a good service to the customer so the company had the need to work with the stock channel to get rid of what was left over.

By that time the company thought it has developed a culture of “retail” so it made a decision to approach the wholesale market with mono-brand locations and/or shop-in-shop experience in the department stores.

Almost always such a change implies a large item offer so the initial “product” idea spread over a “total look” vision with its corresponding design and production problems.

The company we are talking about moved from an offer of about 150 samples to about 500 pieces thus multiplying by three the whole paperwork.

The retail division had a target of about 50 sales point, searched by a consultant and interiorly designed by a fashion architect.



The market: the company operated in the casual sportswear mainly on jackets. Geographical distribution was worldwide but mainly rich eastern countries and emerging countries, due to the average price of the product. The “ideal” customer belonged to a fairly rich class, he liked sportswear and he was fairly aggressive. The style actually intended to be aggressive enough to be chosen both by young and older people.



The existing retail IT system was originally chosen to support the initial outlet, so its main features were:

* Low cost
* Little and clear functionalities
* One level architecture (shops and main)
* single cash register in a shop
* Written and maintained by a near located, “friend” software house.

Quite a few problems had been solved on a “quick” solution attitude as volumes were small, no general approach.

The whole situation was worsened by the fact that no user came from a structured culture environment so they tent to solve their problems on an unstructured, personal way.

When the whole phenomena grew bigger two very dangerous behaviors came up:

# The stockholder thought: “if it works for four it will work for five etc.”
# The software house used to say: “I am willing to grow up with you: tell me what you want and I will do it.”

The company was really pushing the instrument over its project limits patching it over and over.



The economical situation: mainly due to the international crisis the company was financially overexposed and the shop system was a real weight to the balance sheet: out of a dozen shops existing only two or three were profitable, another two or three run even and the rest were both losing money and creating end-of-season unsold inventory. These numbers also did not take into account hidden costs that the company had to sustain to help the shop system; costs which are difficult to pin out but that are often consistent.  I am talking about time spent by “structure” people like accounting and/or logistics to help the whole system run.



The turn point came when an outside consultancy firm had to investigate the economical situation on behalf of a new possible stakeholder. The problem was not so much the retail policy as a principle but the way it had been implemented. The company culture was industrial and everybody used to think to “customers” as being wholesaler, which means professionals, and not final customers.

Even if a retail manager and a merchandiser existed, real decisions were made by people coming from “product” oriented people so many the whole process was still very “fashion” and “industry”.



'''The functional approach''': to evaluate correctly the job to be done we went through a dimensional analysis of the needs of the retail department customers including all the aspects of “product”; “subjective” and “social” aspects.

For every view we tried to find as many “objective” data as possible trying to avoid preconceptions. This job was guided by an external consultant, a right choice in my opinion, as we thought that no internal resource could be enough professionally detached to guarantee a correct evaluation.

First thing the company did was to separate needs: wholesale and final customers. This meant almost doubling the job but it allowed checking whether the requests of the retail channel (both wholesaler and property shop) matched with the “real” final customer wishes.

Physically the job has been done through check lists compiled by hired personnel both in the case of retailer and of final customers. Actually final customers were divided into two major categories: customers contacted in shops (already aware of the brand) and people looking at apparel shop windows (apparel keen but not especially on the brand).

Every interview was then graded according to the expectation of satisfaction both as need and as answer to it. The complete results and the exact form of the questions are not public, what we can derive are the changes the company did in its customer policies.

Question sheet results: as far as final customers are concerned we found that:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “fashion” but “middle low class” and definitely not “high class” as the company thought it was. Competitors were quite different from what the company dreamed they were. Some product categories were “identified” while other were considered “useless”
* Product - reliability: quality was recognized but the price was considered too high
* Product – availability: very low, even if much paper presentation was made on the product, the real possibility to find the item in the shops was low. Part of the problem related also to the fact that the company had decided not to offer on the web a certain number of “flagship” items 
* Subjective – recognition: sales people “customer service ” attitude was judged barely sufficient
* Subjective – attention: sales people technical support counseling was perceived as not sufficient and this contributed heavily to the perception of a middle low class brand
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual sales people but, on the average, not very high; the brand was definitely not felt like “friendly”
* Social – belongness: a strong feeling of group belonging was felt
* Social - distinction: fulfillment of this need is low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

For retailer the results were:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “average”; the rating was better than the one given by final customers
* Product - reliability: good, little commercial returns and very few items with quality problems
* Product – availability: medium/ low due to poor respect of delivery dates 
* Subjective – recognition: quite good, the “retail” customer service was considered very effective
* Subjective – attention: low, customer perceived some sort of company haughtiness
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual agents but, on the average, sufficient
* Social – belongness: no  group feeling existed for retailers
* Social - distinction:  low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

'''Company actions''': based on the results we just quoted, the company decided to

* Product offering returned to about 150-200 pieces for wholesaler and a further set of about 100 pieces distributed only in company stores. These last set of garments were essentially variations on existing garments, to simplify the design phase.  The whole set could then cover the “total-look” scenario for the shops and satisfy brand-keen customers.
* Advertising:  this moved into two directions. The first one tried to re-position the brand in a “high class” section via the relations with testimonials and events. The second activity (fashion and newspapers) was addressed only to the countries where a distribution network existed and not everywhere; only one new foreign market was to be pursued each year.
* Company shops: only economical justified shops stayed open, with the new product offering. As far as new openings were concerned the strategy was to create mixed companies with local operators. These new middle-sized shops were addressed mainly on the sales of the well known products (jackets) and there was a one year starting period to reach balance break even, and no more.
* External wholesalers: the company recognized their importance and created a contact and support groups with the idea of improve their brand loyalty.
* Agents: the company cleared that a new attitude was needed: they were to become not only customer-order collector but also product and “prospect customers” proposers. Quite a few agents did not accept and interrupted their business relation with the company; the major criticism was that there was no longer an independent agent role but that we were talking of company show rooms and methods. This was one of the most difficult parts of the whole project. 
* Company shops sale personnel: a long process of selection and education is still taking place to reach the correct standard in human relations and technical knowledge.
* Shop customer service: it became the real guideline of the retail division. Every aspect has been re-analyzed: from shop lay-out to packaging to personnel clothing and attitude. Mock customers are evaluating each site randomly and their results are discussed monthly at company level and twice-a-year with shop managers.
* Main IT system: the upgrade on this was very limited and it concerned almost only the quality of basic data regarding customer needs like delivery dates or quality indexes
* Retail IT system: this system has been changed very heavily. The operational part has been upgraded to a new instrument and also, even more important, new CRM systems have been introduced regarding both classical topics, like fidelity cards, and new topics like known and unknown person recognition. The possibility to follow the path inside the shop and on the front windows gave the opportunity to improve internal paths and increment the time passers-by would stop in front of the shop.

Generally speaking the reengineering is still going on but the results, up to now, are very encouraging  in terms of customer service and of sales point balance break even where all the company shops are now correctly placed.

= Introduction to methodology =



Starting from the two real case studies we saw, now we want to analyze, at the highest level, the information needs for the processes of a consumer company. This will help us in defining the whole context of data and procedures to be informationally represented. Once we have done this step we can then match the existing coverage with the actual IT system.



In this work I will specifically speak about clothing industry but the method is valid also for other companies and specially for those where “customer care” is a goal and not only an instrument.

It might happen that the customer is not conscious of his needs but then, I think, we should pursue a “maieutic” process of extraction more than the induction of a new need. In this vision of business, agents and retailers are part of the “extended” enterprise as they transmit the idea of “service”.

The reason why I chose the apparel world is that, among companies which operate on physical goods, most probably is the one which best fits the “service” idea in terms of

* Volume of goods and informations
* Changing ratio for the product
* Low unitary value for the product
* Different ways of approaching the final customers
* Difference between “customer” (retailer) and “consumer” (2 decision levels).

Anyway I tried to be as general as possible and you could think of applying this method even to politics as a “service” industry to people.

 Before getting into the phase of analysis, I would like to consider something we quickly quoted: apparel sales are usually made in shop with the help of an employee. From the point of view of producers the “customer” is the retailer or some people in its organization (eg department store) while the “real” market is the end-user.  The employee actually has a very important role in addressing the choice but he is also a fundamental vehicle for the satisfaction of the esteem needs of the “real customer”.

From an information point of view, the employee is a problem as it creates a “human” bias on the sales data (he addresses the sale) and also, sometimes, he forces his opinions into the information system. The same problem exists in the process of selling the garments to the retailers: the agent can be himself a source of information errors.   

 

As my goal is to help defining a model for an information system, to be later translated into technical instruments, I need to define data, states and processes into detail. This is a huge work and I decided to stop at first level; this is not an ERP detail analysis which would be unrealistic. Sometime I go deeper in the analysis when I think that the actual topic has not been fully cleared.



'''Analysis Methodology'''

As analysis practice is not so clear and defined, I tried to use a methodological approach as general as possible using technique of system and process analysis.



Let us define “system” as an ordered set of organized elements all of them aimed at a certain goal. These elements can include physical objects (hardware, software), people, informations, instruments etc.

The representation of a physical system can be made via a dynamic picture (processes) or a static picture (states). A process can be defined as the passage between states (initial and final) of a system; the “state” is the photograph of a system in a steady situation. 

According to the nature of the content, we can divide processes in information-bound (eg document handling) and physical object related (service) ones. In the first group the information and physical process coincide. As far as the second case is concerned let us make an example related to the industrial world: we can define the state (space and time location of goods: logistic view) or the changing process (goods transformation: industrial view).

The associated information system, related to the physical one, must define the context, the initial state and the transformation rules (processes).



Here we are interested in defining the abstract model (information model in our case) of the real system (natural of artificial) which we call physical system. The representation has its meaning in the context defined by variables and metrics which relate the variables to physical data. Context is defined by the choice of variables and their physical significance; state by the initial values (inventory etc.) and process by the measurement quantities (inventory movements etc.).

Informations (context meaningful data) are itself object of some form of treatment: we classify information “functions” into retrieval, storage, transmission, transformation and presentation.

Just for the sake of completeness we quote the conceptual problem of “measure” problem in its two faced aspects of the need of a measuring instrument and of the fact that the measuring action could change the measured system.

We need also to remind that we have been talking about “semantic ontologies” (which means that these rules belong to a general schema including variables and metric systems) while we know that in the global information world there are plenty of unstructured semantics with many informations inside but with a high grade of difficulty in using them.



In this work, we are interested in “business processes” which are artificial processes representing functions related to the activity of a business company. These processes, not like natural systems, do not work on deterministic laws where, once you know the initial state and the total input, the total output of the system is pre-determined. We are talking about social systems in different cultural environments and related to unpredictable events so the output, at most, can only be generally forecasted and not galileianly determined. 

In this chapter more than trying to represent the processes in formally correct a usable language (a task for methodologies like UML), I would like to approach the problem of a methodology to be sure that every aspect of a information problem has been taken into consideration; I am looking how to define all the aspects of an industrial general process, a fashion one in our case.

We already saw that to define the information system we need to individuate the values of the variables related both to the state and to the process; in my experience this passes through the analysis of what I call the “information dimensions” where a dimension is an independent set of information data.

From a practical point of view we have to ask ourselves a set of questions about the initial state and about what happens in the system. The questions I asked myself are:

* What: what is the content of the process; which indicators are chosen and measured in the process
* How: how do I collect and treat informations (state), how does the process happen. This dimension includes the problem of the measuring methods, of the change of indicators (eg six-sigma method) and of the choice of the representation language for a coherent formalism
* Who: the definition of the actors in the process and their representation in terms of informations
* Where: which are the location of the processes; initial, actual and results places? In a global system these places can be very far away so you have to consider time-shift, different languages (presentation) and culture
* When: the time the process starts (initial state), lives and finishes so that parameters are in the final state (remember that people are components of the system)
* How much: what is the change in the variables; both internal and context variables
* Why: the reason why the process happens: internal laws (initial stability of the system) and external (context need).

Out of all these questions the most peculiar one is certainly “Why” as sometimes it is related to external laws or habits and sometimes it relates to internal reasons of order and efficiency. Again these last considerations show that we are not operating in a “classical” deterministic world.

 The “how much” dimension relates the process to the physical reality (remember we are trying to write some sort of “semantics” of physical processes). We should be able to separate really meaningful variables which actually change during the process assuming that, quite often, the change is only a statistical change and the sample is in the limit of the De Moivre (see example) theorem.



It might happen that some dimension coincides: for example imagine the physical process of an apple falling form a tree. In this case the “what” and the “where” of the process are the same as the process is exactly the fall of the apple; this does not mean that we can confuse

“where” as a geographical context and

“where” as a content of the process.

From the point of view of methodology all the dimensions should be taken into consideration and, in special case, some of them coincide.

As we said, we are talking about systems which are not completely deterministic, like classical physics; space-time homogeneity is to be considered a lucky case and not a general situation. This implies that reversibility of processes is not guaranteed, sometime it is even forbidden; so certain technical instruments (compensation handlers) cannot be given for granted.



''' The company goal: a real problem.'''

We assume that a fashion company goal is to create value via improving the level of the apparel worn in the surrounding world which, by itself, is the target market for the company itself. This gets real through four fundamental processes:

* '''Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs'''
* '''Ability to rationalize and interpreter customer needs'''
* '''Ability to satisfy customer needs'''
* '''Ability to explain its capability in satisfying the needs.'''

The way to solve this major task is the full stream of the industrial project with all its aspects: marketing, sales, production, logistics, and structure.

In the marketing books we can see underlined the meaning of the 4P (product, price, place, promotion) which means getting the right product, at the right price, in the right place at the right moment  and tell this opportunity to the customer.

 From an information point of view, this analysis leaves us with more than one open question, the most important: what does “right” means? How can we measure such a quantity? Someone says that it will be the market response to determine whether or not the choice was “right” but this is an answer  “a posteriori”; what a company needs is a correct, or at least “best guess”, forecast “a priori”.



Customer needs: fundamentals

 Before advancing further I think we should clear out what “customer needs” are.

Psychologist  Abraham Maslow indicated a hierarchy of needs into 5 levels:

Physiological needs (air, water, nourishment, sleep)

Safety (medical insurance, job security, peace)

Social needs (friends, group belonging, give and receive love)

Esteem (self-respect, achievement, recognition, reputation)

Self-actualization (truth, justice, wisdom, meaning)

Once a need is mostly satisfied it no longer motivates and the next higher need takes place.

As far as clothing are concerned 

* The first level is never taken into account
* The second level concerns “utilitarianism” which means the basic role of garments as defense from environment (cold etc.). In the rich society this needs is getting less and less important because of many factors (the heating systems, cars) which modify the relation between human body and environment. This need is still very important into technical clothing (work, sport) where functionality is predominant
* In the third level I would introduce personal feeling (cashmere hand feeling, valentino’s red, leather smell) and the sensation we feel when we fit well
* In the fourth level I think we can fit the social factor of recognition in the act of buying the garment (actual sale moment) or in the belonging to a “group” with its distinctive signs. Some authors tent to underline the first aspect but the actual rise in the internet sales seems to contradict them. Another argument supporting the after-sale group belonging experience is related to the expanding business of counterfeiting which could indicate how much people need to be “brand dependent”
* The fifth point, in my opinion, includes a real shopping experience in which the customer is recognized as an individual and his needs are fulfilled in a mature and respectful way.

Personally I think that the rating of the various needs depend not only on the person himself but also on the context (time, place and mood) which, by itself is not a scientific variable.

  

Customer needs: practice

What we really want to do is zeroing the difference between customer expectations and the perception of the product/service quality of what he has bought; in this case we have satisfied our customer who thinks he has paid the correct price for what he buys.

Referring  to the quality service models via multidimensional hierarchical analysis (Dabholkar) or to gap analysis model (Parasumaran et alt.) and integrating other variables, we must satisfy quality parameters related to:

* Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)
* Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)
* Product: availability where and when it is requested
* Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)
* Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)
* Subjectivity : empathy
* Sociality: group belonging
* Sociality: individual recognition.

As we said before, customer satisfaction is a multi-faced operation and we must never forget that the “customer” is “the important person” and not only a “product” accessory, even for the best products. On the other hand, we do not want to “sell dreams” with no product around as, once the sale euphoria passed, we would have an unsatisfied customer and no customer retention in future time.

As far as the “social” part of the company-customer business relation we keep into consideration the difference between “style” and “fashion” (Espinoza  - MIT Media Lab). “Style” is a principal component in group identity so, maybe in a costly way, it can be copied from someone outside the “group”. To keep it difficult for externals to keep updated with the group dynamics, the code must be continuously changed and this give rise to the “fashion” phenomena. Now we understand how “fashion” is something related to the internal of a group while “style” relates to an outside value for the group culture. When a new “style” reaches a critical mass it gets accepted into social culture and some new break point are looked for.

This topic becomes very important when we talk about information systems (in the wide sense) for the social aspect.



Data importance

From a survey we did in a group of generic customers, we found that the relative importance of the various factors in the buying action is





Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)    6,3

Product: availability where and when it is requested    9,0

Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)    7,0

Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)    7,3

Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)    7,3

Subjectivity : empathy    6,6

Sociality: group belonging    5,9

Sociality: individual recognition.    6,3





It is important to point out that these values are related to a sample of customers in the field of apparel so its value is significant only in this field.



Methodologies for a solution

Actual methods for solving the customer needs are now essentially two:

# Industry: start from customer  requirements and designing the whole industrial process (design, production, logistic) to fulfill the need
# Trade: choosing globally and offering locally what the retailer thinks is the best solution for the customer need.

These approaches, obviously, have some common aspects but also some special features that we shall discuss later.   

= General processes =

Let us now analyze the processes which exist in both methodologies.

== Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs ==

In this process, the system is the environment “company – potential customer” where the customer is the owner, more or less conscious, of his needs. The goal of the process is to share this information with the company.

'''Why''' should we try to perceive the need? The answer lies in an agnostic approach on other people needs. In my opinion a company role is not to believe to be the truth depositary but to be the instrument for maybe extracting and solving customers requests.

'''Who''' acts in the process of need perception? Three kind of people act: who has the need (the customer), who collects the need, who transmits the need.   

Feeling the need, the customer is the person who explicitly raises the request (demand driven) or who owns the hidden need who is to be extracted (supply driven).

We can categorize our customers into:

* Well known customers, person we know via a history of relations (fidelity cards or so); among these customers we care particularly about customers who have shown to be statistically significant in terms of representation of the whole customer set
* Unknown or random customers
* Potential customers: among these we could include people belonging to social groups which we consider target for our product, people looking at shop windows or people coming and not buying anything (prospects).

It is obvious that there are different marketing strategies on the three groups: in the first case we want to keep our customer and increase cross-selling or up-selling. In the second situation we want to make our customers loyal, in the third case we want to reduce entry barriers.

Collecting customer needs: I think we can individuate three kinds of people, the first one is someone whose job is to “feel” the market in its wider sense (society, various environments), sometime they are called “cool hunters” or scouts. The second group is formed by the agents who work together with retailers: their view is wider than the single retailer but is narrower and more precise than the one of the scout. The last group is made by sale executives who are actually in contact with specific customers so they have a clear, definite view of a limited request.

Transmitting the information: it would be easy to say that these people are the same that collects it, but it is not true in my experience. This function is often felt as a secondary job so it is delegated to another person, an assistant, done in the spare time or even worse hidden as felt part of the person assets. This attitude implies a great loss of quality in the information transmitted to the company.

'''What''' is a need, what does a customer looks for. Let us start by classifying this dimension on three values:

* Defined needs: specific requests of a definite object  (raincoat, wind jacket) maybe connected in a new environment (eg long gloves for snowboarders)
* Semi-structured requests: more general than the former one, yet not very precise. One possible example could be “something like that jacket but the fur around the hood” or “slightly longer or shorter”. This kind of requests, mainly regarding the product, are often expressed in a sign, non-verbal language so they are very difficult to collect and transmit
* Geographical or context needs: particular colors related to a culture or a “glamour” trend better than an understatement. These are examples of customer needs difficult to receive and use but very rich in informations.

In this dimension we have actually analyzed only product needs, we can use the same detail level also for the other levels of needs (internal esteem, social and self-actualization needs). As far as I know there is no research going on this topic which seems very interesting and largely unknown.

'''Where''': about the place the need occurs. There is definitely a relation between the “where” and the class of needs (defined, semi-structured or context); we can recognize:

* Shops: these are the places where there is an explicit interaction with the customer regarding well structured needs. This is a very important information asset
* Shop windows or shop routings: we are talking about potential customers who do not interact explicitly, this is an important patrimony of informations fairly unstructured and difficult to catch and categorize
* Competitors: we are looking at customer needs through what the competitors are offering; it is like looking at the solution and trying to guess the problem. This becomes important when competitors have access at context we cannot get into, for example far away markets
* General geographical distribution: the most general and also the most difficult situation to analyze; as an example you can think about the fact that there is no accepted taxonomy in the fashion business.

As far as the definition of the collection and storage of data, the problem is now shifting form technology problems to the definition of an accepted semantic of data.

'''How'''. To understand how we can perceive customer needs let us consider how these needs show out. We can think of three kinds of externalization:

* Conscious personal needs like an explicit request to a sale operator
* Unconscious personal needs like taking a garment in my hand, looking at it and putting it back
* Social needs like a new “fashion”.

How do we perceive these needs: for each kind we must think of a way to define the elementary information (the state) so we need

* Instruments for sales support, both real and missed
* Instruments for context analysis
* Instruments for competitors analysis
* Instrument for social trend analysis.

Specially talking about the first process, we must be very careful about the easiness of use and the precision of the instrument as the actual operator sometime works in a “normal” situation and sometime in a changed environment like “sales” or “rush times”. Another topic to be considered is related to the significance of the data we are collecting:

* Does an observed customer behave like an ignorant one?
* The data I am getting are biased by the collection process?

At the moment I think these can be considered smaller problems compared to the fact that now we have no data.

 Last but not least there might be a problem on context bias: if we collect data in a luxury shop we shall have a “luxury” view of the problem, same thing for a low income customer environment. This obviously becomes a problem in inter-class analysis while it is not so bad if the company target is parallel to the sample set.

'''When''' do we collect informations and do we use them?

Using the data schema we just defined, we can say that

* Geographical or context needs have a longer time horizon than the specific product; could be one or two years
*  Semi-structured requests are looking mainly a few months in advance, from one season to another; they seems a slightly shorter “time to market” of what is accepted today
* Defined needs are typically immediate in their nature; the ideal would be to answer as soon as the need arise.

Data collection time is definitely related to the nature and horizon of the need but we can post it, more or less, in the sale period and consider a large period dependence on the level of the signal.

 Usage is again related to the class of need and has a strong period dependence the shorter the horizon is.

'''How many signals''' should I collect and how significant must they be?

This is a three sided problem: a problem of method, a problem of measured content and a problem of reference value.

Let us face the method problem: if a customer exclaims “beautiful” in front of a garment the statistical variance of the variable “beauty” is equal to the value of the variable itself so the information is not very reliable. De Moivre’s theorem tells us that the variance of the sample is related to the variance of the population sample as the reciprocal of the square root of the dimension of the sample. Four people saying “beautiful” are twice more reliable than one customer and begin to be statistically significant.

As far as the content of the variables we want to measure, they have to allow you to create a predictive model so they must be objective oriented. Let us make an example: sales turnaround during full price periods and during sales. If we make this analysis in mono-brand shops this becomes an indicator of price correctness between different categories as the offer stays the same and only the price changes so if the trousers percentage sales increases it means that people thought that trousers were too expensive. If the same statistics was run in a multi-brand wholesaler this could be an indicator of “among-brand” competition.

This last example introduce us to the third problem: the value of a measured variable has to be properly fit in its context. A large fur company made a large error some time ago when its sales rose quite lot in one period. This was due mainly to a large competitor’s problem but the signal was interpreted as a growing trend. The fact was that the company did not take into account the fact that the whole fur-coat market was in a steady/declining situation so the raise was to be explained as temporary phenomena.

This dimension can thus be summarized as the capacity of collecting “good” data on significant variables and fit them in the right context.

'''Methods and instruments''': the collection of data is a very difficult process from an operational point of view. 

* Defined needs, as we said these needs exist only for known customers in well defined places. Almost all sales point have instruments for operational processes (inventory movement, invoices, cash accounting), some of these products also have limited CRM functions mainly for after sale care (fidelity cards, recalls). A few of them also have options for supporting sales planning both a budget point of view and from a space/path analysis. As far as I know there is no common solution for requests and lost sales analysis.
* Semi-structured requests related to occasional or unknown customers. In my opinion this is an uncovered field as no specific instrument is available. I read about one experience of customers wearing RFID bracelets to follow their path inside the sale room but it seems to be abandoned (I would not have liked it). Video analysis for figure recognition, apart from privacy problems, is not yet fully available.  
* Geographical or context needs: This is a huge and extremely interesting information problem.  It relates to the capacity of analyzing socially open spaces to get signals of “trends” which might appear. As far as I know there is nothing like this existing at the moment. An interesting approach would take into consideration TV and movie pictures: they are biased by the choice of the costumes director but they can be analyzed more and more, till when the algorithm gives acceptable result.

'''

== Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs ==



In this case the context system to be considered is the company and the process goal is to share the data perceived by the marketing department with the design, industrialization, production and logistic departments (industry) or purchase department (retail)  which are the ones who have to propose a company realistic solution.

'''Why''': the existence of this process is related to the need of  converting  general  into company  useful data; we need to translate context events into an internal useful language.

'''Who''': people can be involved in this process both as process and state definition resources. As we shall discuss later (How) methods can be various and this implies that the relative importance of the various actors is quite different. Going back to the various roles, we can point:

* People supplying data are the same collecting them or market search external companies
* People rationalizing customer needs: marketing, product or market managers as this is a very delicate operation which needs high technology competence and market knowledge. Maybe  a better name could be “product/service” analyst.
* People interpreting: in the fashion-product environment they are called “stylists” and they merge context, unstructured, informations with marketing data with a view for a long time horizon.

The relative role of these people is obviously related to the company market positioning: in a luxury company the stylist role is prevalent compared to the same in a large mass market enterprise.

 People using these data are people in the design and supply chain of the company.

'''What'''. As we said customer need is made up of physical objects (the product),subjective aspects (personal esteem) and social requests.

As far as product requests we can divide between “upgrading” , variations on existing themes, and “innovation”  which relate to requests which did not exist or did not have an answer in the former technological context. This last need is the most difficult one to satisfy as it implies the ability to interpreter social sign which could have an impact on future customer desires.

Subjective needs can be divided into “Basic” messages related to the “universal” nature of man, for example ease-of-use, comfort, functionality and “culture related” messages linked to the context the man lives in, for example color choice and matching which are very related to the society the consumer lives in.

Social messages: our aim is to be able to quantify social attention and recognition and social reputation.

At the moment these are very vague parameters.

'''Where'''. As far as the geographical location where the process exists we must keep track of two aspects:

where the process actually takes place, mainly the company main site, and where the process results are used, typically we are talking about the localization of the results. At the moment the most common ways to proceed on the topic include either local analysis and central strategic consolidation or central analysis and local adaption. Unfortunately both solutions tend to have a “time to market” too long and this reduces the competitiveness of the system, we shall get back on this.

'''How'''. As soon as we start talking about analyzing data, so that they become information, the first thought is about data-warehousing, data-mining and, eventually, knowledge management. In reality we are now trying to rationalize and interpret needs and not hidden or explicit correlations. The problem is thus quite bigger and it must include also informations different from what we have in our standard information systems.   From a methodological point of view we can divide analysis into 

* Rational: taxonomies and  abstraction/interpretation methods and instruments. This last group include projections (defined schema and historical data) and previsions (new schemas on historical data)
* Semi-quantitative: analysis of competitors, market semantic analysis
* Irrational or context analysis.

 Usually all methods are taken into consideration as we try to avoid theoretical models which could be not complete or intuition with no relation with reality.

It could be very interesting, at the moment I know of no tries, using heuristic techniques for the solution of interpretation models; I guess model are still not formal enough.

'''''''''When'''.  From the time point of view we must consider two different horizons: the analysis period and the time the results are meaningful. 

As a rule of thumb it is correct that the analysis should be done at the same time of the data collection as it might turn out that some data are incomplete or wrong. 

The validity of the result, for the physical part, is related to the total lead time of the product we are considering while it is not clear how long our analysis is valid when we talk about customer service, it could be interesting analyzing this.

'''How much'''. This dimension is always very difficult to quantify. Let us go back to the Maslow pyramid: how much do I need to satisfy level 2 (product) before moving to level 3 (personal needs) ? We assume that this percentage does not need to be 100% as once the homeostatic equilibrium of the lower level is reached, attention will move to the upper level. The point is: solving the lower at 80% and the upper at 50% (assuming that you succeed in measuring it) is better than 90%-40%?

I think it is a company choice to be made.

Altogether we must estimate the need for

* product in terms of which is our reference market, its dimension, our positioning (the quota) and  how much does our product satisfy the market in terms of price/performance
* personal/social aspects: how important and how much do we satisfy them.

'''Instruments'''. Now that we went through all the dimensions of the process of “Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs” we can have a look at the state of art as far as available instruments. We can group them into

* Analytical methods: based on known and recursive data
** Algorithmical and or statistical: at least statistically precise
** Heuristic: model not totally defined
* Contextual methods: using common sensations, even if not measurable and recursive
** Brainstorming
** Top-down or bottom-up methods.
* Individual methods: related to a particular man-environment situation, very often give non-reproducible results, eg. Zen ispiration.

 As a personal opinion, even though different methods could be seen as provocative to some people (think of a physicist who should use a zen approach), as long as this process gives usable results is should be accepted anyway. Human beings have being using gravity as a force and apples kept falling long before Newton quantified the mathematical model. Man was using heuristic models to create manufacts.  In field of social science maybe we shall never have a Galilean, recursive model  but this does not mean that we must not get better use of data to be informations.



   

= Industrial processes =



A possible way to satisfy customer needs is to use specific processes. This means designing, industrializing, planning and producing garments which satisfy the need.

The group of customer we address can be various, it might vary from a single person (make to order) to a homogenoeus set of people on which we make some sort of “average” consideration; if I am talking about well-off teen-agers I need to make different evaluations and  reasonings from a middle-age low income group.



== Ability to satisfy the customer need. ==

The context is the system customer-company; the process goal is to satisfy all the requests starting from the fact that we know them. In this case the information system is a support system, not a core topic.

'''Why'''. We think that satisfying the customer will give immediate return and future perpestive to the company.

'''What'''. The expected results of the process include

* Product: an increase in physical appeal, reliability and availability of the product; a better looking, better quality and easier to find product.
* Subjectivity needs: a better customer care and satisfaction
* Social needs: a better customer group recognition and individual attention, the customer perception of the company as “trusted partner”.

Obviously these results need to be measured on customer expectation.

'''Who'''. People involved in customer satisfaction includes

* Product: design, industrialization, production, logistics
* Personal needs: sales, after sales, CRM executives, retail 
* Social needs: promotion, brand managment, public relations.

'''How'''. This point is about techniques to be used for cusotmer satisfaction.

In the product area we are concerned about the processes quoted as “direct” in the Porter chain value model. This area is surely the most studied in organizational modeling, we can quote various methodologies from BPR to Kaizen. It is surely not the goal of this work  to get into this problem, better authors then me have worked on this and you can refer to them. 

Personel needs: the studies concerning this area, in my opinion, are not as structured as in the former area.  As far as I know individual aspects of this field have been evaluated but in a stand-alone context, not in a complete customer relation view. The topics we are talking about concern

Customer centrality and adaption to the market

Product availability impact on sales

Sale channel competence and friendliness

After sales service impact

Customer relation management

Direct approach importance: the shop relation

Customer social needs are, in my knowledge, not the object of quantitative studies. This might depend on the fact that data collection is very difficult, so we are still at the level of hypothesis and specific experience collection. We are talking about:

“group” creation and belonging: brand nature and the role of promotion

brand management  and group life-cycle

public relations and their results

“personal” service.

'''Where''' does the process take place: I think we can define the place where the customer is the location where the process starts. Obviously the cusotmer can be anywhere in the world so we must take this into account. The rest of the process may then take place 

Product: in the stylist studio, in the technical, industrial, loistic and retail areas depending on the specific subprocess

Subjectivity needs: sales, customer service and retail areas

Social needs: anywhere as customers can be everywhere.

All these areas must be informationally connectable.

'''When'''. As for the geographical aspects also for the time-related variables the sinchronicity is very important; if you are late in a subprocess there is little chance that you will be able to recover afterwards. This is the deep meaning when “time to market” has been chosen as the critical variable in the next future, speeding up every single phase might give you the elasticity to cope with unforecasted events which might have disastreous effects.

The real problem, in my opinion, is to balance the time associated with each subprocess.

Product: the total lead time, from the idea to the availabilty, in the fashion wholesale world, lasts about 8-9 months; this period is actually deeply questioned by e-commerce and its related attitude.

Subjectivity: we can think of

Pre-sales (contacts, reciprocal knowledge)

Sales

After sales (recal and custom loyalty).

These process mainly happen on a few months horizon, a slightly longer period than the product cycle.

Social needs. The process of creating a “group” is fairly quick, the real problem is keeping the “group” alive through many years. In this process the “customer attention and recognition” can only start once you have created the “group” so it takes even longer.

'''How Much'''. The metric we use is about 

Product: Aestethic, quality, availability, cost and accepted price 

Subjectivity needs: service, reassurance, empathy

Social needs: how much does the “group” means, how much am I reconized inside the “group”.

As far as the “product” indeces there are quantitative data available related to quality (Aql methodology, number of returns), availability (question sheets and lost sales) and price positioning (sales to full price ratio). As far as I know there are no indeces related to aestetichs, maybe only the number of collection presented  items which never got produced.

Speacking about “service indeces” we have to divid “service quality” and “satisfaction index” (Oliver 1997).  The first is related to external indeces and standard measuring techniques (SERVQUAL, SERVPERF) while the second is related to customer perception. The fact that customer gets in the analysis of the index, introduces two further variables related to time (quality has a fairly long horizon, perception short) and space (consumers in different countries and context have different perception of “satisfaction”).

As far as I know there are no quantitative analysis related to “group belonging” or “group recognition”.

'''Instruments'''

The most well known instruments existing today surely cover the areas of product definition  (PDM) and production controlling (ERP); there are good instruments in forecasting, CRM and sales support.

Getting into details and assuming these are my personal opinions:

Product definition: there are good products helping the product definition (style, PLM, model marking, quality control) and they support time-phased georaphy problems via distributed workflows

* Production processes: definitely the best studied and supported area; you can find instruments (ERPs) very well done both on the theoretical foundaments and technical aspects. The only doubts are about their operational easiness and friendliness.
* Distribution instruments: not at the same level as the ERP but on the right way to be there.

Subjectivity needs support instruments:

* Customer relation: some good CRM package is available but it is still a long way to go to be really complete
* After sale support: it is considered the sales minor process so it has not been developed so much
* Retail. Very good in the operational aspects, not so much for the remaining subprocesses.

Customer social needs: available instruments are essentially question papers statistically analysed; there is no automatic data collection.

Talking about information systems I would like to return to a concept which I think very important. As customers are distributed all over the world, particular care must be taken at every level of integration, not just the technical one (Miotto etc.) if we want to avoid dangereous misunderstandings. Information integration is usually underestimated even though it is well known (Davenport) the importance that information technology had in process disintermediation.

  

== Ability to communicate the capacity of satisfying the need ==

The system is the customer-company environment; the process goal is the fact that the customer ( “group of customers”  to be addressed by my “solution”) is aware that a solution to his needs exists.

'''Why'''. We want the customer to be really aware of the existence of a solution of its limits because real customer service is respectful of customer identity and does not mislead facts.

'''What''' do I communicate, what is the content of the process.

* The knowledge of product content: aesthetics, reliability, availability and price/performance
* The fact that it is really that “product” that satisfies his need (whether primitive or induced)
* The context knowledge about expectation satisfaction, something like saying “come with us and you will be all right”
* The “group” belonging and brand identification
* The “group” recognition.

Regarding this last point we must be very careful about privacy issues, to know each person individually means knowing a lot of informations about him and this might not be compliant with local laws and/or create relation problems with the customer as he feels controlled and classified.

'''Who '''is involved in the process. The customer is the “receiving” (destination, output) part of the process and the company is the active (input) part. Obviously when we talk about customer we must keep in mind all the categories we have been talking about (known, unknown, potential) and calibrate methods and politics for each group.

'''Where''' does the process take place. As we noted companies and customers can be anywhere so the process must be geographically distributed. As far as places where the process takes place we can recognize:

Product: media and PR (testimonials etc.)

Subjectivity: direct sales channel (retail), indirect sales channel (wholesaler), other various channels including word of mouth 

Social: media, retail and PRs.

'''How '''we communicate the information.

Product: direct advertising (I show the product and associate it at human sense), indirect advertising (for example technical people explain characteristics, I get attracted by the person and through him I get to the product); comparative advertising.

Subjectivity: service advertising ( we show our customer service level), the level of professionalism and availability of our sales executive, the product context (packaging, advertising campaign), the service context (POP material, shop furniture and look).

Social promotion: social involvement (e.g. Toscani’s photos per Benetton), fashion shows, licensing, media, internet community, sales point formats, sponsoring; everything which helps creating a “group”. For “group recognition” we must think in terms of personal service.

'''When'''. The time factor in communication is quite different for each need:

Product: the timing is related to the availability (shop, internet or other); it is useless and wrong to communicate a capacity which does exist in reality so it is very important to synchronize ability to communicate and satisfaction capacity

Subjectivity main issue is “trust” which is a long asset to create and a quick one to be destroyed; its time scale is even longer than fashion and style as it might get through different stages of the company; usually it is years long

Social issues, in my opinion, are linked to the idea of “styles”; they are linked to “cultural break” and easiness of information exchange has deeply changed the time scale which I would indicate in a two-three years  period.

'''How much''' we need to communicate means defining the quantity of actions related to each former dimension. In the next chapter we shall propose a view where this dimension is actually related to the evaluation of the cost/return I have in each combination of variables. We know that evaluating the cost is feasible, not easy but usually can be done, while evaluating the return is very hard and it is usually done through side indicators like sale increase. I think there is a lot of work to be done in evaluating measurable parameters.

'''Instruments''': we partially quoted them in the “how” paragraph, we are talking about publicity and PRs. As far as I know there are no instruments, now, able to quantify, as an example, the return of the investment of a fashion show in terms of social impact on the knowledge of a “brand”.

 

== Industry: the architecture of the solution ==

To organize what we have been saying up to now, we have to create a schema including, for each process, every possible combination of the information dimensions we have been considering. Some of these combinations might be nonexistent like “sure needs of potential customers”. 

As an example of the operational method we can have tables like this one:

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Need data collection&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Analysis&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Satisfaction&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Communication&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;Process&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Product'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Subjectivity'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Imagine the first process of need data collection,  here we can ask ourselves which are the needs 

Of a well known customer

Collected by a sale executive who transmit them

Semi-structured needs

Collected in a shop

With a very clear question

At the beginning of a sale campaign

Which means that we are considering one of all possible combinations of parameters.

Later in the book we shall get check how many are the meaningful combinations (Appendix A).

 In this way we are segmenting the total information problem in “cells” each of which has its own individual analysis of states and processes parameters. 

In this method we are not really taking into consideration the “when” and “why” dimension. The “when” variable is related to the variation of the schema in time: an open issue. The “why” parameter, at the top level, is human related and, in my opinion, has the basic meaning of the actual nature of economical enterprise, but this is also an open issue.



This schema reminds us of the phase-space in statistical mechanics where the cell weight is not even but it is related to the weight the company gives to it in its strategy. As in statistical mechanics the content of the cell is a function of both the initial state and the state variation rule (the process), assuming a first order non explicit time dependence. 

As far as the cost of cell fulfillment we can imagine a curve like this:



Where the cost to satisfy 100% is very high. The growth coefficient depends on the nature of the cell and it should be the result of specific analysis which locate the cell in the total analysis space.

When we talk about the value and the cost of a analysis cell we must not forget the reliability of the data we are using in terms of data collection, methods and people involved. This makes things very difficult when you think of a global solution so most companies, in my opinion have been using two side methods:

* What do other people do ( market driven policies)
* What is it going to happen if  I don’t do this (scare of “not doing”).

The method I propose, not forgetting the associated difficulties, is to break down the problem into specific cells and define local strategies in a wider architecture.

I really think that a complete semantic ontology of all cells, including time and space dependence, is a non realistic result so I propose a local approach using also heuristic techniques.

'''The company strategic plan then becomes'''

* '''Assigning a value to each cell of the “customer needs” phase space'''
* '''Trying to associate a cost to the fulfillment of that cell'''
* '''Maximize the the phase space covered with the constraint of the company total resources and define the attitude regarding the cells which are not considered for this moment.'''

From an information system point of view, in practice we need to quantify, for each cell,

The weight it has, related to company strategy

The value of information relative to the cell based on a definite metric system

The cost of getting that information.

The total combination gives the information scenario for the company. 

The time factor shows its importance both in fact that the context keeps changing and also in the fact that no company starts from scratch; usually there is an  information patrimony specially in the areas of product needs satisfaction (sales and production). The critical strategy factor now becomes the ability to choose the best solution for choosing the variation of customer phase space as to reach the best overall coverage.

From a practical point of view we start from the highest level four processes, get down to the individual cells and determine the actual company value, the cost of maintenance  and the cost of upgrading.





''It could be interesting to compare the structure of this analysis with the deployment of software projects. The phases of needs collection and rationalization is very well known in the enterprise software production while it is very little formalized in manufacturing.  On the other end the phase of capability communication is much more developed in the industry context.''

  
= Retail Processes =



We define “retail” as the set of processes which satisfy the availability need in a customer related space-time context. The difference between this set and the previous one is 

# The subject of the process, the retailer, does not satisfy the need starting from designing and projecting the answer from scratch but he tries to solve the problem choosing the  solution, among those on the market, which he thinks will better fit customer requests (sales methodology)
# The relation between retailer and final customer is much more “direct” than in the industrial case so many “non product” aspects are more important.

We can see the retail process from three different point of view:

# Final customer: form this point of view “retail” is simply the availability  in a “local” form; needs and data collection are the same as for the industrial environment
# Retailer: problems concern both to satisfy customers (purchasing and selling) and to relate to the context 
#  Context: this relates to how “retail processes” exist in the society both as time phased phenomena (geography = shops, shopping centers; communication etc.) and structure (fiscal and legal compliances)

From the customer point of view “retail” is a service process centered around the actual sale moment but we must remember that it really consists of before sale, actual sale and after sale (preparation, actuation and conclusion).

'''Process Analysis: the customer point of view'''

We know that, generally speaking, customer needs are:

Product        Aesthetics, reliability, availability

Subjectivity    Problem solving, reassurance, empathy

Sociality    group belonging, individual recognition



And that, for each need, direct processes imply:

* Data collection for all the data levels and views
* Analysis and method rationalization to be more efficient and precise
* Satisfaction given by the fulfillment of the need of the real product or of feeling
* Communication which means the ability to communicate the possibility of satisfaction.

The actual need coverage is through the balancing of these factors.

 From the market point of view, the weight of each parameters corresponds to the positioning of the company in the market share.

In the following table we can see how a group of users has quantified their expectations as a function of the sales channel

== Process analysis: the retailer point of view ==



 From the point of view of a retailer, the definite question is:

“why does a customer comes to me and how can I satisfy him ‘”

Which means “which are the customer needs and why does he feel that I can satisfy them ?”.

In the world of retail the contact is not with a “customer” but with a “specific customer”, this means that subjective and social needs are very much stressed compared to anonymous relations. It happens that shops may live on “local” emotional realities (mono or multibrand wholesalers) , some other times they have a more “diffuse” approach (department stores, large distribution). 

The birth of a “sales project”, to satisfy a particular customer need at any level of Maslow scale, then is the result of a sales enterprise which evaluates the market opportunities in terms of the lack of a product in a certain area/time, the availability of structures (shops), a new sales method or the existence of an unexploited sociality.

We start from our daily experience to group elementary processes into categories; this will help us in the functional analysis of the retail system.  Processes are sets of actions which satisfy needs whether these needs concern customers, retailers or the context. We assume that, if a process exists, it must have some meaning otherwise it would not exist any longer. Not every possible process exists or, sometime, we are not aware that it exists.

Our methodology starts from listing the processes and then looking for their value on customer needs; we must be very careful to distinguish between “real” value and “customer perceived” value; customer are only interested, and ready to pay for,  in the second ones while there could be processes (eg finance control)   which have no value for the final customer but are very important for the retailer. We shall be using the “perceived value” parameter.

To be completely correct from a methodological point of view we should define each process to the very detail, in fact we adapt to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of a process, this means that the value of a process is a function of 

* The relative importance of the customer need (what I satisfy)
* The perceived value of the solution: the expectation (how much I satisfy it).

In the following tables:

Processes are grouped by areas

Coding is such that

Effect on the process: H = high, M = medium, L = low, blank = not applicable

Grouping level: C = customer, G = group, T = context

Area: P = product, S = subjectivity, C = sociality, O = organization, F = fiscal

== Customer need – process existence relation ==



Let us look at the processes we just quoted (remind that needs belong only to the final customer); to fulfill them we need to operate on three different levels (not to be confused with operating entities):

* Single customer
* Customer group : customers of one specific sale point which means how the local retailer organizes the service
* Context: general aspects of service which means how is the general service defined, how to handle general topics ranging from product presentation to fiscal procedures.

The “retail” system does not consists only of processes related to customer relation but it has to cope with many levels of activities; this is the meaning of the “group” attribute in the former table.



Retail support systems: the information processes.

We speak explicitly of “support” and not of software because,  as you can saw from the process listed, the content is not a pure “data” parameters but if often connects to physical or psychological aspects.

We also saw that final customer  and retailer needs somehow differ both in content and in relative weight. 

From an industry point of view the retailer is “the customer” and this is why we need to understand which are the needs he needs to satisfy and he is willing to pay if satisfied.

We can think of retailer needs general schema as:

What we derive from this table is that “single”, “final” customer needs have been largely disappointed in the industrial attitude; companies tend to focalize on “customer groups” as their ability to solve needs is essentially related to product/social  and not to subjectivity capabilities.

This aspect of the end customer need is mainly covered by the “retail” structure.



To be methodologically correct we should now take into consideration all the 32 cells; out of these only 6 (“customer group”, data collection and analysis) have already been taken into consideration in the industrial analysis. In the following pages we shall group some cells to avoid being too long even though we realize that we make a methodological approximation.



'''''''''Customer processes'''

Personal needs are, by definition, very “personal” so they need a very “local” application of general principles stated by the company. The information content is actually very little formalized: we are moving in a very unexplored field.

'''''Product: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are talking about the behavior of a specific customer in a specific sale situation: a very elementary context.

* What: we are looking at the relation between the customer and the garment he is evaluating;
* How: which are the parameters to decide “will the garment fit the customer expectations ?”  or even better: “will the garments satisfy the customer need?”
* Who: the actors involved in the process = the customer and the retailer
* Where does the process take place?  typically a real shop but it could be a virtual one
* When does the concurrence of product/customer occurs ? presence of both customer and product
* How much is the customer need satisfied: this is perhaps the most difficult parameters to measure directly
* Why: this the company strategy.

Assuming that we want to satisfy customer need, I think that the only information instrument which can be used is the sales executive capacity to support requests on product (fashion, quality)  and customer (decision process). Time length and variability of relation, in my opinion, make impossible for a formal information system to be really useful.

Measuring system can only be indirect through a total evaluation of the sale executive.  

'''''Product: communication'''''

The aim of this process is to make the specific customer understand that it is possible to help him in choosing the right product. Assuming that we think that the correct local instruments are sales executive, we want the customer to trust sales executive in their knowledge of product and can help him in determining the product coverage of his needs.

* What: sale executive product competence
* How: must be explicit and customer must recognize it
* Who: the information instrument is the sale executive or, at most, the store manager
* Where: in the sale area, this means physical availability of the vendor
* When: during real and prospect sales
* How much: as far as I know there is actually no formal system of measuring this process, maybe through customer interview
* Why: because it satisfies the customer.

As far as information supports, we must give the actual instrument (the sale executive) the knowledge he needs both on the product he is selling and on competitors so that he can help the customer to judge correctly the answer to his needs.

'''''Subjectivity: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are  talking about elementary processes which concern ability to answer, personal assurance and empathy to a particular customer.

* What: as we are discussing of very individual, peculiar data. I think that the signals and the collection method are very difficult to categorize, we could try to classify the results. From a practical point of view we should define the results we want and leave to the sale executive the method to collect the data regarding customer individual feeling etc.
* How:  we could start from classifying (based on our experience) customer approach and check the results of possible general support standards we offer
* Who: people involved are sales executive and store managers (control level)
* Where: every possible customer relation, mainly in sales area
* When: before, during and after the sale
* How much: a possible measure of unit could be store manager evaluation
* Why: because customer must be at ease from a human relation point of view.

Information support: The sale executive must be empathetic with the specific customer so he must fit his way of acting to the actual situation. Information content must then relate to the sociological world of sales and, eventually, to the social and fashion trends.

'''''Subjectivity: communication'''''

* What: we want to communicate that a customer feels at ease in a particular context. It is a very personal phenomena and it is related mainly to the sale executive empathy, to the sale place format and to the brand image.
* How: the most important means I know of are word-of-mouth messaging and architecture design
* Who: mainly the sale executive, also every other company employee
* Where: mainly the shop but also the general social context
* When: it is important to note that both actual sales but also prospect and possible sales are extremely important for this topic
* How much: I think that only customer interviews can be a measuring instrument
* Why: to get returning customers.

This topic is fairly delicate because customer expectations can be very different from company policy and very often we saw a large gap between the two approaches.

'''''Sociality: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

* What: the content of this point is about the customer feeling himself recognized and accepted
* How:  the whole process starts from customer receiving and recognition which must be precise. In the case of recognition this can be done through formal instruments (fidelity cards) or informal ones (the sales executive memory). In any case there must be standard procedures for each case.
* Who: this is mainly a sales executive job
* Where:  Typically the sales area; it is an interesting topic to understand what this means in a distributed location (internet)
* When: always, during real or prospect sales
* How much: a possible way of measuring this data could be the number of visit a customer does whether they became a real sale or not
* Why: to create a nicer environment for our customers.

From an information system point of view the first problem is related to customer recognition. Sometimes we can find some sort of “fake” personal recognition (eg intimate friendship) which annoys the customer, the real cases I can think of are either related to the high luxury environment, where quite a few customers are well known from social news, or small local retail with a consolidated personal knowledge of the customers. In other contexts we must rely on some personal interactions supported by CRM systems not to loose company knowledge.

'''''Sociality: communication'''''

* What: we are talking about the fact that a customer knows he will be recognized and helped
* How: on this topic we can think of formal communication systems like advertising but my opinion is that the best way is word-of-mouth and group diffusion
* Who: people involved are mainly sales executives and store managers
* Where: the sales place and the logical surroundings 
* When: during the whole relation with the customer (pre, actual and after sale)
* How much: a possible indicator could be the number of contacts; both ways and any possible content
* Why: because it helps satisfying the customer.

The information object includes the content (“welcome”),  the form (direct or indirect message) and the destination (actual or prospect customers).

 


== Group processes ==

Customer group needs are those industry relates to. As far as data collection and analysis processes, we can refer to the first part of the book as we are talking about collecting and categorize common customer needs; retail is a different way of solving them.

'''Product – satisfaction.'''

* What: the topic is about product availability  in the whole time cycle including after sales. We should divide the process in purchasing, stocking, shelf availability and after sales. Problems concern offer analysis, purchasing operational, sales space limitation as we assume that bulk storage is not a retail problem; the whole system is the retail industrial chain. 
* How: operations through subprocesses of purchasing, exhibition, sales and after sales service.
* Who: people involved includes merchandiser, buyers, sales executive and customer service.
* Where: any site of the company
* When: we can estimate a few months period
* How much: the whole process is so large that I think the only summary indicators we can use is the economical turnaround of the enterprise unit (shop etc.); subprocesses can be individually measured.
* Why: this is seen as the real nature of the retail structure, could not be the only one.

Customer satisfaction is “the process” of a retail system as it has to conjugate market availability and specific customer request. From an information point of view it asks for a huge amount of informations (see appendix B).

'''Product – communication'''

What: we are talking about the process which makes the customer understand that, in that place and at the right moment, he will find the answer to his product needs (group level). We thus deal with an information content.

How: we can use formal systems (commercials, press, window presentation) or informal (word-of-mouth) in large social contexts and personal systems (human relations) in limited environments.

Who: usually we cope with professionals in large scales and sales executive in small environment.

Where: Social contexts mean the whole society, up to world scale, and especially in aggregation area while small environment means essentially shops.

When: product satisfaction is not a one shot process, it needs to be created before and fed also after sale, this means that communication has to be time calibrated.

How much: without any communication product access is essentially stochastic so we can have  a first guess relating amount of communication to sales increase.

Why: because it might be that the customer doesn’t know that we can solve his need.

This whole topic should  be analyzed by itself.

'''Subjectivity  - satisfaction'''

* What: in this group we can identify a few topics. We can identify the role of the sales executive (technical expertise, personal attitude, follow up), customer-context relations (shop image, goods location and availability), customer-company relation (commercial, shop windows). They are all the result of how the company has imagined its relation with the customer.
* How: customer satisfaction can thus be a result of how we support
** Sale executive competence both on product and relation
** Context design and product merchandising
** Space positioning, visual merchandising and commercial.
* Who: persons involved include sales executive and sales structure managers to project the sale process
* Where: both in the shop and in the company studios
* When: a real sale experience does not last a moment, we must create a long lasting customer relation
* How much: I think one of the parameters we should consider is customer retention and find a way to measure it (eg fidelity cards)
* Why: we want to satisfy every aspect of our customers.

Informations related to this process are various and need a separate study.

'''Subjectivity – communication'''

What: this topic is about how we can communicate our ability in satisfying customer subjectivity

* How: 
** sales executive: after the specific training, we must communicate our employees ability in a formal way to the market (group of customers)
** customer – context: after the design of a comfortable shop environment we must be very strict in assuring that the standard is kept
** customer-company: like before we must underline our ability in individual attention.
* Who:  people involved include sales executive and communicators.
* Where: we must act any place a prospect can be but especially near shops, as to use take advantage of existing structures.
* When: we are not talking of a specific product so there is no definite time zone, it is a continuous job with peaks when no specific product is to be advertized
* How much: I think we could use the number of visiting people in our shops as an indicator
* Why: to cover any aspect of subjectivity need.

The information request set is too large to be analyzed here, further studies are needed.

''' Sociality – satisfaction'''

This process is concerned with smaller groups of customers than those addressed by industry, retail is more “locally” concerned either from a geographical (customer in a certain area) or from a social (customer of a certain type) point of view.

* What: the aim is to create a sense of belonging so that the customer refers to the shop, also maybe not for purchasing
* How: the attachment may be induced either directly (direct marketing) or indirectly (social signs)
* Who: it is usually a PR person working on these topics
* Where: the place is related to the sale method (place or market type)
* When: the time base is fairly long as it implies personal involvement
* How much: a possible parameter to measure such a process could be the number of visit, whether for purchase or not, to the company locations
* Why: it is not so easy to create the “social” concept of the retailer, especially for multi-brand retailers who do not share a company support.

Let get into more details for this area. Our analysis could take into consideration:

Customer reasoning:

What qualifies myself from the context?

How much does belonging to that group cost ?   

Which are the group identities and testimonials?

How can I avoid being considered “standard” and yet belong to the group?

Retailer reasoning

How much does it cost to create the “group”?

How much does it cost to maintain the “group identity”?

How much do I get in terms of new customers or upsales form the “group”?

Generally which is the “group” trade off?

I think we can look at two possible ways of approaching the problem:

Internal: a “group” needs to have times and places it can exists (like happy hours in bars etc.) and archetypes it can recognize, testimonials defining the “group characters”

External: a “group” needs symbols like shopping bags or reserved events.

From an information point of view we can measure

Customer retention both in number and quantity

New customers entries

PR costs.

These data are very difficult to obtain as they are much perturbed by product data, at the moment I do not know of reliable analysis on this topic.

'''Sociality – communication'''

While industry communication is essentially based on product, retail communication underline the idea of service, of problem solving. This idea implies that it is more of a institutional then technical communication.

* What: I want to tell people that my “group” is a “happy community” and you can join it.
* How: the mean is related to the market I am heading, no general rule.
* Who: the person who acts is mainly a PR, the customer receives.
* Where: the main targets are customers and prospects so it has to be evaluated where to spend the money; internet is a world situation
* When: if you act just once it is dangerous: the customer asks himself why of these expenses; the “group” communication has be lasting in time as it connect people and it has to create trustworthiness 
* How much: let us divide customers and prospects. Customer are to be steadily reminded, the parameter we could measure is customer retention. Prospects are to be invited, we could neasure new entries as a function of expenses.

The informations we need to control are various and often not explicit : imagine we talk of teen-agers buying clothes. Clothes are not just a way of dressing,  it is also a request for meeting similar. This means that a shop is a meeting point and it has to fulfill this need so that the teen-ager likes to stay in the shopping area. Places where you can only buy, in my opinion, have little chance against the web-offer, on the other hand satisfaction places are more expensive than normal shops.

From an information point of view the problem is thus to quantify the ratio between the capacity of satisfying customer social need and economical balance.

  


== Context processes ==



Context processes group all those operations which have no direct relation with the customer so these processes create no customer perceived value but are necessary for enterprise functioning.

A rough classification could divide them into “fiscal” processes (related to external existing rules and laws) and “organizational” (related to process “best practices” in the business area).

Context process are the one which are best known from an informational point of view as they derive either from formal rules (fiscal) or from repetitive experience (organizational); they are also the best information system supported processes. It is not the aim of this paper to describe more deeply this set of processes; I only would like to point out that, as they create no customer value, they must be considered a pure cost driver and the information system goal should be to satisfy the enterprise need reducing these costs. Typically this goal is achieved using methodologies as standard as possible introduced in the company via education and/or consultancy.

== Retail: the solution architecture ==



As we discussed in the industry part of this paper, in retail also we can create a schema for the set of processes related to the company information strategy. The matrix needs-functions is the retail phase space where each cell has its own cost and value; the complete figure is the company positioning strategy.

Some of these cells need to analyzed at a more specific level (eg group-product  satisfaction) ì; we should then sum the subprocesses cost to derive the total cell cost while the value is available only at a upper level.

We can think at the “true value” of the need as the product of the need importance multiplied by the channel expectation for the market we are operating, we find a result like the following table:

Based on this schema,  a retailer, as long has he decided which one is his operating channel, can find the relative value of customer need, his problem is now to decide “how much do I want to invest in satisfying this request”.

As we saw, each of these cell is made of many elementary processes with its own contribution to the final cost; this allows us to derive total cost as the sum of the whole solution.

The information technology goal is both to detail the information content and the analysis of a single subprocesses and to reduce the cost of each of the processes  itself using technology in the right way (where possible).

It is obvious that we start from processes which have the highest customer value so that they have  a quicker return.

= Conclusion =



The aim of this work is look for a schema in the structure of information  processing in a consumer industry. Personally I think we can recognize four types of consumer industry:

Physical goods with industrial origin (apparel, shoes, cars)

Physical goods for personal satisfaction (perfumes)

Services (non material goods) with industrial origin (security)

Services for personal satisfaction (films, bodycare).

Foe each type of industry organizational best practices, KPIs and data collection instruments have been defined but I believe that, up to now, information systems have developed only a local coverage related  to immediate needs or to the existence of a single cell information model. 

Looking at the whole information context it turns out that quite a few cell have information characteristics (timing, number of data, algorithms) that make a complete formal model unfeasible to exist. It turns out more useful to adopt a simplifying  approach and reengineer the process.

Sometimes the general approach is not possible also because it might happen that you are still defining the  elementary process. In particular there are many cells not covered by information models and instruments; most of these situation occurs from historical priorities or from lack of technical instruments.

In my opinion we could derive that

I think that, actually, the whole part related to customer subjectivity and sociality is left to the retailer experience and intuition. This attitude implies that satisfaction indexes are bound to be very inaccurate and inefficient. 

Obviously the relative weight of the various cells is related to the context we are working and, up to now, the “product” cells have been the most important.

In a globalized world were access to product will be eased by technical instruments, other factors will become more and more important so we shall get to analyze them.

We also need to stress that subjectivity and sociality assume a fairly different meaning in the internet world and this aspect is completely unknown at the moment.

Phase space for processes

As an example let us try to define the phase space cell for some general and industrial processes, not considering meaningless cell and taking into consideration the initial state of the processes.

'''Processes – customer group level''': here we can have more “general” (eg sale market analysis, purchasing) and more “specific”  topics (eg shop emotional paths definition); this might change the level of standardization we can find. Let us consider a fundamental retail need:

Customer group level: product-satisfaction.

In this part we consider the processes regarding availability of the product for the whole time period, including after sale. We can spot the following subprocesses:

* Market offer analysis
* Purchasing
* Stock management
* Sales area availability
* After sale behavior.

Assuming that request analysis (what does the customer group wants) has already been done, we want to use those informations.

'''Market offer analysis'''

In this process we match what the market offers with what our customers want. This process mainly takes place in two different ways:

Catalogue analysis

Physical analysis

''Catalogue analysis''

* What: we want to find, in the market we have access (first constraint), the product which best gets near to our objective in terms of
** Nature (clothing type and category)
** Technological properties (composition etc)
** Aesthetical and fashion parameters
** Price range
** Supplier characteristics (reliability etc.)
* How: this process used to be, and partially still is, fulfilled via information channels like technical papers or physical agents
* When: the search is made essentially when a new collection is introduced so there is little time for changing and this creates markets rigidities
* Where: a multibrand retailer has limited possibilities to make real geographical analysis, we are talking of a fairly strict constraint on this point
* Who: the real actor is the buyer, in small entities this corresponds very often to the seller
* How much: with the actual information systems this process is fairly slow, we might think of using, as a measuring parameters, the number of suppliers taken into consideration
* Why: we want to increase the knowledge of the market offer

This is a process in which there are very large possibilities of increasing the information quality, maybe standardizing the offer methodology; the problem seems to be related to multibrand confusion.

Physical analysis

* What: in this process the retailer checks the correspondence  of initial informations and controls certain unavailable data (garment fit, fabric real color)
* How: the process takes place where the physical garment is available (fairs, show rooms) 
* When: the time must be compatible with market requests 
* Where: as said, in fairs, show rooms or agents information points
* Who: people involved includes buyers and offering companies
* How much: it could be interesting measuring the distance between the catalogue offering and the real offer; we should interview the customers
* Why: to reduce wasted times

The information system support for this process is, in my knowledge, near to zero. The goal could be a historical feedback system for operators.

''Purchasing''

This process begins after product choice and includes operations related to purchase order creation and control. It is a standard industrial process which we only quote quickly without even getting into details like quotation, offer and order confirmation. 

* What: it is the process of defining the characteristics of the supply in terms
** Physical: goods to be delivered, place and date of delivery, delivery context (packing, labeling etc.)
** Non physical: terms of payment, quality standard, information data.
* How: operational aspect of the purchase order (paper, electronic data interchange)
* When: purchase order can be made in various moments: fairs, later back home
* Where: as before it depends on customer/supplier organization
* Who: entities involved include customer, supplier and, sometimes, third parties like agents or credit companies 
* How much: process dimension could not be related to the economical amount (think of small boutiques buying many codes and little quantities) but we could think in terms of SKUs
* Why: it is a steady state both from the physical and the information point of view.

From the information systems point of view, this is one of the best known process and there is plenty of knowledge on it.

''Stock management''

In this process, after we have chosen and ordered the garments, we are to keep track of the physical location.

* What: the process is about knowing where the goods are; they could be at the supplier, in transit, in the warehouse or in the sale area
* How: our system must help us in giving the situation both at the moment and in the next future (eg passage from transit to warehouse)
* When: the system must be available always and must give response on inventories at any time
* Where: the process must support people anywhere it is needed, both locally (shops, warehouses) and remote (company headquarter)
* Who: there are operational actors (shop executives, warehouse employee) and control people 
* How much: it is obvious that precision is a must; sometime fiscal limits are law defined
* Why: sales points are part of a larger system designed for customer satisfaction.

We need an information system which gives you the situation in any part of the customer dedicated world (supplier, logistics, shops); at the moment we are not yet in this situation.

''Sales area availability''

This point is about the way goods are to be shown so that customer probabilities, to find what he is looking for, get higher.

* What: as we know what the inventory is, we need to balance space vs. goods and to define exposition priorities (paths and areas)
* How: the choices we make must match customer needs and quantities taking into consideration that we might have to cope with missing quantities to be filled in the future
* When: the matching process between goods and space is obviously related to goods availability (spaces are generally fixed on the short term) and to customer visit frequency. It is usually considered a two-three weeks period.
* Where: where the sale takes place
* Who: usually it a is a visual merchandiser job, in smaller sales entities it is a senior sale executive job
* How much: department stores have long studied this problem, it is not in the aim of this paper to get into it
* Why: no doubt a good explosion helps the customer in finding what he is looking for.

From an information point of view, data concern customer and product presence (actual and future), customer revisit attitude and product appeal on the local market.

''After sale behavior.''

To satisfy the customer we must also project to implement after sale behaviors. After sale has two main components: returns and follow-up.

Returns

* What: we are essentially dealing with garments with quality standards not as expected
* How: returns are mainly processed via a shop physical hand back and the substitution with another garment or a refund
* How much: timing is mainly law defined and it might last from a few days (unsatisfaction) to months (quality problems)
* Where: the return process usually happens where the sale process took place
* Who: acting people include the customer, the retailer and the garment company
* How much: it is easy to be measured and, obviously, should be as little as possible
* Why: because this process is somehow part of the sale process, it is a side effect

Follow up

* What: this process help us in defining our new sales standards, it should measure the difference between the relation perception at the sale moment and later in time
* How: we must identify customer correspondence between customer expectation and real result
* Where: we have to be able to re-reach our customers where they stay
* Who: this process is available only for trackable customers so we much try to increase this number
* How much: to be statistically significant
* Why: to drive future sales processes

As far as information system is concerned, returns is a typical summary process so it needs operational and control systems while follow-up is also an analytical process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pathos represents an appeal to the audience's emotions. Pathos is a communication technique used most often in rhetoric (where it is considered one of the three modes of persuasion, alongside ethos and logos), and in literature, film and other narrative art.

Emotional appeal can be accomplished in a multitude of ways:

* by a metaphor or story telling, common as a hook
* by a general passion in the delivery and an overall emotion and sympathies of the speech or writing as determined by the audience. The pathos of a speech or writing is only ultimately determined by the listeners/readers.

Arguing that the city shouldn't demolish the park to build a mall because it would make adorable puppies sad is an example of an argument that uses pathos. Inherent to the argument is the notion that people love happy adorable puppies and hate adorable puppies to be sad.

=== Prevalence:===
Stroke is the fifth most common cause of death worldwide. An estimated 350 000 Australians are currently recovering from stroke, with approximately 150 000 living with a stroke-related disability&lt;ref name=&quot;Weerd&quot;&gt;Weerd, L. et al. (2012) ‘Health care in patients 1 year post-stroke in general practice: research on the utilization of the Dutch Transmural Protocol transient ischemic attack/cerebrovascular accident’.  Australian Journal of Primary Health. Vol. 18 pp. 42 - 49&lt;/ref&gt;. 
=== What is a Stroke? ===
A stroke occurs when there is a sustaining disruption of blood flow within the brain. Depending on where the disruption occurs, the death of specialized cells will cause severe disabilities in mental cognition, motor control, or speech&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;World Health Organization (2005). WHO STEPS Stroke Manual: The WHO STEPwise approach to stroke surveillance. Geneva, World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ischemic Stroke - A blood clot from a distant blood vessel breaks off, travels to the brain and blocks a small blood vessel (embolic). Alternatively, the blood vessel becomes so narrow that blood cannot pass through it (caused by atherosclerosis)(thrombotic)&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;/&gt;
* Haemorrhagic Stroke – A blood vessel in the brain bursts (caused by thinning of vessel lining) (Intracerebral). Otherwise, bleeding occurs in the area surrounding the brain (not in the brain tissue)(subarachnoid)&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;/&gt;

===Causes of Stroke&lt;ref name=&quot;Weerd&quot;/&gt;:===
* Abnormal blood cholesterol and lipoprotein levels
* Hypertension and atherosclerotic lesions within blood vessels
* Diabetes, high inflammatory responses, carotid artery disease and other chronic cardiovascular diseases	
These comorbidities significantly increase the chances of a stroke, and stem from risk factors such as &lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;&gt;Gordon, N. et al. (2004) ‘Physical Activity and Exercise Recommendations for Stroke Survivors: An American Heart Association Scientific Statement’ Journal of the American Heart Association.

! Exercise     !! Recommended Activity from The American Heart Association and the National Heart Foundation of Australia &lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;/&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Briffa&quot;&gt;Briffa, T. et al.

|-
| Aerobic || 30 mins of moderate intensity  (walking, riding), on most days of the week
|-
| Resistance || Low to moderate intensity 2-3 days a week targeting weakened muscles  
|}
Before undertaking exercise, the patient must be prescreened.  Current medication, range of mobility, strength and associated comorbidities must be considered in devising a supervised exercise program.

==Improving Compliance:== 
* Involvement and support from the patients family and social interaction &lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;/&gt;
* Psychological state (a positive outlook) and an interest in prescribed exercises will lead to increased motivation
* Altering activities to reduce exercise-related pain caused from comorbidities 
* Catering to patient’s daily schedule (associated time restraints)

Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1983 to 1984''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2011. ISBN 1606995235)

*p.&amp;nbsp;102 (August 24, 1983) As the strip indicates, the French term ''esprit de l'escalier'' translates as &quot;wit of the stairway&quot;. Schulz used French terms several times during the course of his strip, mainly during its later half, and all of them were authentic.
*p. 144 (November 29, 1983)  The motion picture ''[[w:Flashdance|Flashdance]]'' was released in April 1983 in the United States and enjoyed a large success at the box office.  Bill Melendez released an animated parody of it (and of other dance films) in April 1984, under the title ''[[w:It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown|It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown]]''.
*p. 151 (December 16, 1983)  It seems that Sally's script refers to the Christmas carol [[w:Hark! The Herald Angels Sing|&quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;]], well known in English speaking countries.
*p. 156 (December 27, 1983)  &quot;Snowperson&quot;: political correctness in the early 80s had gone quite far in its attempts to erase gender-biased expressions from the common language.   At that time, many tried to be gender-neutral to the point of sacrificing clarity, for example in sentences such as &quot;Every man/woman shall don his/her life jacket and report to the steward/stewardess nearest to him/her.&quot;  Some common nouns disappeared at that time, for example, &quot;fireman&quot; was replaced by &quot;firefighter.&quot;   In a somewhat related gag, [[w:Jim Unger|Jim Unger]] in his cartoon ''[[w:Herman (comic strip)|Herman]]'' had a sales clerk telling a customer: &quot;We live in a very strange era,&quot; with in the background a banner saying &quot;Grandperson clocks.&quot;
*p. 193 (March 23, 1984)  There is a &quot;Highland Park&quot; and a &quot;Selby Avenue&quot; in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  Schulz lived at the corner of Selby and Snelling, where his father's barber shop was also located.
*p. 220 (May 25, 1984)  &quot;Playing trivia&quot;:  Trivia games started in the early 80s, with [[w:Isaac Asimov|Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[w:Super Quiz|Super Quiz]]'' possibly being the first of them in 1982.  They became very popular by the mid-80s.
*p. 240 (July 9, 1984)  &quot;[[w:Girls Just Want to Have Fun|Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]&quot; was a popular song in early 1984, sung by [[w:Cyndi Lauper|Cyndi Lauper]].
*p. 255 (August 14, 1984)  &quot;Roy Hobbs&quot;: Although the novel ''[[w:The Natural|The Natural]]'', by Bernard Malamud, was released in 1952, [[w:The Natural (film)|the movie based on it]] was produced and released only in 1984.

Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1985 to 1986''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2011. ISBN 1606995723)

*p.&amp;nbsp;xi (Foreword by Patton Oswald)  &quot;Snoopy even adds a new make-believe character to his repertoire (...) a bowtie-wearing, bowler-topped attorney.&quot;   That sentence is misleading, as the attorney persona of Snoopy in fact appeared many years before 1985/1986.

*p.&amp;nbsp;47 (April 19, 1985)  It seems Snoopy is cured of the &quot;weed claustrophobia&quot; that plagued him in 1956.  See the strips of October 27, November 3, and November 6 to 9 of that year.

*p.&amp;nbsp;94 (August 7, 1985).     A &quot;punker&quot; is &quot;a punk rock  musician or a devotee of punk rock  or punk  styles.&quot;. They were especially prevalent during the late 70's and 80's.

*p.&amp;nbsp;94-95 (August 7, 1985-August 9, 1985)    Although the term &quot;mallies&quot; doesn't actually exist, the type of people Schulz was referring to did. In the 80's, and still today, there are several people who can be possibly referred to as &quot;mallies&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;97 (August 12, 1985)  [[w:Yuppie|YUPpies]] (from &quot;Young Urban Professional&quot;) defined the 1980s more than any other social group.  Their way of life (expensive tastes and professional ambition) was fueled by the financial and economic optimism of the era and was the subject of many books, movies, and television series ([[w:The Bonfire of the Vanities|&quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;]], [[w:Family Ties|&quot;Family Ties&quot;]], [[w:Wall Street (1987 film)|&quot;Wall Street&quot;]]). 
  
*p.&amp;nbsp;127-128 (October 23, 1985-October 25, 1985) &quot;The Lone Eagle&quot;, as the first strip of this series explicitly indicates, was Charles Lindbergh, who, as this strip also indicates, made the first nonstop solo flight from New York to Paris. Snoopy's &quot;Lone Beagle&quot; outfit is also his World War One Flying Ace outfit as well.

*p.&amp;nbsp;128 (October 26, 1985)    Wayne Gretzky is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. The joke is that Rerun's helmet looks like a hockey mask.

*p.&amp;nbsp;128 (October 27, 1985) One of the rare instances where an adult's speech appears in Peanuts.

*p.&amp;nbsp;131 (November 1, 1985)   &quot;Beagle Blaster&quot; refers to ghetto blasters, an 80's slang term referring to &quot;a large, powerful portable radio, especially as carried and played by a pedestrian or used outdoors in an urban area.&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;133-134 (November 6, 1985-November 9, 1985) Halley's Comet, officially designated 1P/Halley, is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years. Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years. As this strip series explicitly indicates, Sally has the date at least a month too early, and the comet's actual arrival was on February 1986.

*p.&amp;nbsp;170 (February 1, 1986)    ''She has what is known as a ten-speed..'' A ten speed is &quot;a system of gears having ten forward gear ratios, especially on a bicycle. &quot;. These types of bikes were particularly popular during the 70's and 80's.

*p.&amp;nbsp;174 (February 9, 1986)  The poems Snoopy writes down are plays on a classic love poem that may be traced at least as far back as to the following lines written in 1590 by Sir Edmund Spenser from his epic The Faerie Queene (Book Three, Canto 6, Stanza 6):


:It was upon a Sommers shynie day,
:When Titan faire his beames did display,
:In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,
:She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;
:She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,
:And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.

The version Snoopy is lampooning is the most popular one:

    
:Roses are red,
:Violets are blue,
:Sugar is sweet,
:And so are you.

*P. 175 (February 10, 1986)  About the political correctness of the 1980s concerning gender bias in language, see also the strip of December 27, 1983.

*P. 175-176, 178-179 (February 10, 1986-February 15, 1986, and February 16, 1986 -February 21, 1986)   As the series explicitly indicates, the flu Snoopy(as the World War One Ace)catches is the great influenza epidemic of 1918-1919. As it also states, before it ended in 1919, twenty million people had died from the disease.. The armistice that was to mark the end of World War One that was mentioned February 19, was also signed during those years of death and disease.

*P. 178 (February 19, 1986) &quot;The war is over!!&quot;  Actually, the war is not over for Snoopy's pilot persona.  It will return to fight on October 4, 1986.

*p. 179 (February 22, 1986) The national anthem of the Unites States of America is the Star Spangled Banner, of which lyrics come from &quot;Defence of Fort McHenry&quot;, a poem written in 1814 by the 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy ships in Chesapeake Bay during the Battle of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812. The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot; (or &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, it would soon become a well-known American patriotic song. With a range (tessitura) of one and a half octaves, it is known for being difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was recognized for official use by the Navy in 1889, and by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at 36 U.S.C. § 301), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover. Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom. &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. &quot;My Country, 'Tis of Thee&quot;, whose melody is identical to &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the British national anthem, also served as a de facto anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent American wars, other songs would emerge to compete for popularity at public events, among them &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;184 (March 5, 1986) &quot;Baby on Bike&quot; is a reference to the rising popularity of &quot;Baby on Board&quot; warning signs in the 1980s.

*p. 185 ((March 7, 1986) This strip is a little bit confusing, as at first glance it appears that Snoopy is talking in the last panel. However, on closer inspection, it is revealed that it is in fact the body of Snoopy talking. One of the possible hint to this is the scrunched up line directing the thought balloon to its bearer that only Snoopy's body parts have.
 
*p.&amp;nbsp;188 (March 15, 1986)  James Gould Cozzens was, as this strip indicates, the author of &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;192 (March 23, 1986) Medic is slang for doctor.

*p.&amp;nbsp;195 (March 30, 1986) The definition of the word &quot;ganglion&quot; Linus is referring to is the less known one, meaning &quot;a small lump most commonly on the hand or foot&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;202-203 (April 15, 1986) ''What have we done to Fort Zinderneuf?!'' Fort Zinderneuf was the main setting of the 1966 film ''Beau Geste''and the 1924 novel it was based on.

*p.&amp;nbsp;208 (April 28, 1986-May 3, 1986) The Maypole Dance that is celebrated in U.S. in Secondary or High School dances as part of a May Day celebration are nearly identical to that celebrated in the United Kingdom. Often the Maypole dance will be accompanied by other dances as part of a presentation to the public.The earliest use of the Maypole in America occurred in 1628, where William Bradford, governor of New Plymouth, wrote of an incident where a number of servants, together with the aid of an agent, broke free from their indentured service to create their own colony, setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement, and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies, as well as an official officer of the king, bearing patent for the state of Massachusetts. The May Queen or Queen of May is a term which has two distinct but related meanings, as a mythical figure and as a holiday personification. This series is referring to the latter, the May Queen who is a girl who must ride or walk at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations. She wears a white gown to symbolize purity and usually a tiara or crown. Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations. She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins. Certain age groups dance round a Maypole celebrating youth and the spring time.

*p.226 (June 9, 1985) This the first appearance of Lydia.

*p.&amp;nbsp;247 (July 29, 1986) Maynard is misquoting the Scripture Luke 10:7(The laborer is worthy of his hire) as Luke 10:4.

*p.&amp;nbsp;252 (August 10, 1986) Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Franck, Lehar, Tchaikovsky, Elgar, Schubert, and Gershwin were all famous composers.

*p.&amp;nbsp;253 (August 12, 1986) Buck Beagle in the 25th century is a parody of the famous 1930s comic strip Buck Rogers in the 25th century, which also was a favorite of Schulz's as a youth.

*p.&amp;nbsp;254 (August 16, 1986) Joe Garagiola is an American former catcher in Major League Baseball who later became an announcer and television host, popular for his colorful personality. He was well known for being one of the regular panelists of The Today Show on NBC for many years. He also happened to be a good friend of Schulz's.

*p. 258 ''Fort Zinderneuf'' '''''See annotation on pages 202-203'''''

*p.&amp;nbsp;263, 265-266, 268, 289, 292, 301 (September 4, 1986-September 6, 1986, September 8, 1986, September 13, 1986, September 15, 1986-September 17, 1986, November 5, 1986, November 10, 1986, and December 3, 1986) Tapioca Pudding is a satirical remark on runaway licensing, and her name is a likely parody on Strawberry Shortcake, as both of them are named after a dessert item.

*p. 274 (October 1, 1986) The first balls were made of natural materials, such as an inflated pig bladder, sometimes inside a leather cover, which has given rise to the slang term &quot;pigskin&quot;. Modern balls are designed by teams of engineers to exacting specifications, with rubber or plastic bladders, and often with plastic covers. Various leagues and games use different balls, though they all have one of the following basic shapes:

|    a sphere: used in Association football and Gaelic football
|    a prolate spheroid
|        either with rounded ends: used in the rugby codes and Australian football
|        or with more pointed ends: used in American football and Canadian football

The precise shape and construction of footballs is typically specified as part of the rules and regulations. The oldest football still in existence, which is thought to have been made circa 1540, was discovered in the roof of Stirling Castle, Scotland, in 1981. The ball is made of leather (possibly from a deer) and a pig's bladder. It has a diameter of between 14–16 cm (5.5–6.3 in), weighs 125 g (4.4 oz) and is currently on display at the Smith Art Gallery and Museum in Stirling.

*p. 277 (October 8, 1986) A zamboni is an ice resurfacer, which is a vehicle used to clean and smooth the surface of an ice sheet, usually in an ice rink. The first ice resurfacer was developed by Frank Zamboni in 1949 in the city of Paramount, California. Zamboni /zæmˈboʊni/ is an internationally registered trademark, though the term is often used as a generic colloquialism for any ice resurfacer.

*p. 283 (October 22, 1986) Fog is a 1916 poem by Carl Sandburg that reads:
:THE FOG comes
:on little cat feet.

:It sits looking
:over harbor and city
:on silent haunches
:and then moves on.

*p 293 ''I'll eat first, and then I'll call the Humane Society!'' The Humane Society is a group that aims to stop human or animal suffering due to cruelty or other reasons, although in many countries, it is now used mostly for societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCAs).

* p.301 (December 3, 1986) This the last appearance of Tapioca Pudding.

*p.&amp;nbsp;308, 310 (December 19, 1986-December 20, 1986, and December 22, 1986, and  December 24, 1986)      This unnamed kid closely resembles Shermy, a character who disappeared in the year 1976.

This demonstrates how to make a [[w:Rainwater tank|rain-barrel]]. Components of instruction will be separated so a rain-barrel can be made to the builder's preference. Hopefully, [[w:Rainwater harvesting|rainwater harvesting]] can come in handy for a ''rainy day'' or [[w:drought|drought]]. The assembler and user are responsible for drinking water safety.

A rain-barrel is useful in developing nations or regions where clean water may not be available. Rain water is relatively pure, still precautions need to be taken for sanitation and health safety. Mosquito larva and other organisms need to be kept out. Bacteria, protists or other microbes can develop inside the rain-barrel, so proper heat sanitation treatment in a cooking container may be necessary before consumption.

Be mindful of: air pollution, potential acid rain, proper disinfection, maintenance, [[w:drought|extended drought conditions]] including [[w:desertification|desertification]], [[w:Purified water#Health effects of drinking purified water|lack of minerals in water]], rain collection surface and other variables. The project assembler and users of the rain-barrel are responsible for drinking water health safety and avoiding shortages.

==Common materials==
* food-grade [[w:barrel|barrel]] or new plastic garbage can (non-cancerous made material)
* 1/2 male brass valve
* 1/2 pvc threaded coupling
* 1/2 [[w:o-ring|o-rings]] (make connections watertight)
* 1/2 in [[w:hole saw|hole-saw]] with guiding drill (can be used on a properly sized hex bit hand screwdriver)
Threaded fittings with o-rings eliminate or reduce the need for pipe cement.
If the desired threaded fitting is not available in pvc form, galvanized or brass fittings will connect to pvc fittings. Any metallic connector should be non-lead.

==Drinking water connection==
Use a 1/2in hole saw to cut a hole on the bottom side of the rain-barrel. Put an o-ring on the valve, insert it in the hole. Put on the other o-ring from inside the plastic can, then thread on the female 1/2in pvc coupling.

If plumbing is connected, prevent unsanitary conditions from backing up into or siphoning into the water-barrel: a check-valve, and precaution to keep the connected piping or tubing off the ground and away from unsanitary conditions are desired.

==Overflow==
Use the hole saw to cut a hole on the side near the top of the plastic can out of the way of the lid. Put an o-ring on the male threaded coupling, then insert it through the inside of the hole, from the inside. Put an o-ring on the coupling from the outside of the lid. Put a 1/2in (faucet type) strainer inside the 1/2 elbow. Thread the 1/2 elbow on the coupling, facing it down when done.

==Additional water-barrels==
Near the bottom side of both rain-barrels, drill a 1/2in hole. The water-level of the connected rain-barrels will remain in equilibrium. If the connection is made too high, the water from one barrel will not be able to empty into the other. For each rain-barrel use threaded couplings, with an o-ring on each side of the water-barrel walls. Flexible pvc tubing with appropriate connectors between containers is ideal.

Each additional rain-barrel can be made with only one hole drilled in it, because the multiple connections can be made externally with Tee or Cross fittings. This simplifies closing off the drain connection by fitting on a threaded plug, if this secondary barrel is wanted for another purpose. Two connection points per secondary barrel can be made optionally.

==Lid==
Use the lid, not the can, for inflow to the water-barrel from gutters or other collection surface.

==Foundation==
Rain-barrels can be upright partially below ground, or it can be on cement blocks. If the water barrel is partially below ground, the top of the water barrel must be above the highest potential flood level, to avoid sewage or other contamination, and a pump may have to be used. All connections, especially below potential flood level, must be watertight. Sand can be used for the foundation, to prevent initial shifting of the water-tank to prevent it from breaking. Once it is settled, this is unlikely to be a problem. Bricks may be built around it for aesthetic purposes, or for keeping it out of view.

[[File:Plane.svg|200px|thumb|left|Orientation (or “attitude”) of a plane measured by bank (= Z = φ), elevation (= X = θ), and heading (= Y = ψ). (The axes are labeled differently in the main text.)]]
This tutorial discusses different representations of local rotations in Unity. It is based on {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

This is the first of a few tutorials that demonstrate useful functionality of Unity that is not directly associated with shaders. Therefore, the presented code is in JavaScript.  

== Unity's Euler Angles ==
If you create a GameObject and select it, the '''Inspector''' will show three values X, Y, Z under '''Transform &gt; Rotation'''. These are three Euler angles measured in degrees. (More precisely spoken, they are one possible set of three Tait-Bryan angles, or nautical angles or Cardan angles, since they describe rotations about three different axes while “proper Euler angles” would describe a set of three angles that describe three rotations where two rotations are about the same axis.)

In JavaScript you can access these three angles as the &lt;code&gt;Vector3&lt;/code&gt; variable [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-localEulerAngles.html &lt;code&gt;Transform.localEulerAngles&lt;/code&gt;]. The documentation states that the angles represent — in this order — a rotation by Z degrees about the z axis, X degrees about the x axis, and Y degrees about the y axis. More precisely spoken, these are rotations about the fixed(!) axes of the parent object (or the world axes if there is no parent object). Since these rotations use fixed axes, they are also called “extrinsic rotations”.

These three angles can describe any rotation of an object in three dimensions. In the case of &lt;code&gt;Transform.localEulerAngles&lt;/code&gt; they actually describe the orientation of an object relative to the parent's coordinate system (or the world's coordinate system if there is no parent). Rotation in the sense of a rotating motion is discussed below.

In aviation, Euler angles are used when the orientation of a plane is specified relatively to the fixed axes of the ground (e.g. a tower of an airport) as illustrated in the figure above. In this case, they are called “bank” (corresponding to Z), “elevation” (corresponding to X), and “heading” (corresponding to Y). The following JavaScript code can be attached to an object to set the Euler angles in terms of these names. (In the '''Project''' view select '''Create &gt; Javascript''', double-click it to open it, copy &amp; paste the code from below into the script, and drag the script from the '''Project''' view over the game object in the '''Hierarchy''' view, then select the game object and find the public variables of the script in the '''Inspector'''.) 
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
#pragma strict

public var bankZ : float;
public var elevationX : float;
public var headingY :float;

function Update() 
{
   transform.localEulerAngles = 
      Vector3(elevationX, headingY, bankZ);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Interact with the three variables in the '''Inspector''' to get familiar with their meaning. You could start with all three angles set to 0. Then change bank, elevation, and heading (in this order) and observe how the object rotates about the parent's (or world's) z axis (the blue axis in Unity) when changing bank, about the parent's x axis (red) when changing elevation, and about the parent's y axis (green) when changing heading.

In order to establish the connection with the elementary model matrices in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}, this subsection presents how to compute a rotation matrix from the three angles X, Y, Z (or θ, ψ, and φ).

The 4×4 rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; for a rotation by an angle φ (= Z) about the z axis is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
\cos\varphi &amp; -\sin\varphi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\sin\varphi &amp; \cos\varphi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The first two coordinates of the leftmost column can be understood as the rotation of the vector (1,0) by an angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, which results in the rotated vector &lt;math&gt;(\cos\varphi, \sin\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. (The illustration uses the angle ''t''; thus, the result is &lt;math&gt;(\cos t, \sin t)&lt;/math&gt;.) Similarly, the first two components of the next column can be understood as the rotation of the vector (0,1) by the angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with the result &lt;math&gt;(-\sin\varphi, \cos\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Analogously, the 4×4 rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{x}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; for a rotation by an angle θ (= X) about the x axis is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{x}(\theta) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos\theta&amp; -\sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta&amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

And the 4×4 rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi) &lt;/math&gt; for a rotation by an angle ψ (= Y) about the y axis is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
 \cos\psi &amp; 0 &amp; \sin\psi &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1&amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin\psi &amp; 0 &amp; \cos\psi&amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the sign of the sine terms depend on some conventions. Here we use the conventions of Unity.

These three matrices have to be combined in one matrix product to form the total rotation. Since (column) vectors are multiplied from the right to transformation matrices, the first rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; has to be in the rightmost place and the last rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; has to be in the leftmost place. Thus, the correctly ordered matrix product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_\text{rotation}(\varphi, \theta, \psi) = \mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi) \mathrm{R}_{x}(\theta) \mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; 

The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_\text{rotation}(\varphi, \theta, \psi)&lt;/math&gt; can then be multiplied with other elementary transformations matrices to form the model matrix as discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

In Unity, you could compute a 4×4 matrix &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; for the Euler angles &lt;code&gt;X, Y, Z&lt;/code&gt; in this way (quaternions are discussed in more detail below):
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var m : Matrix4x4 = Matrix4x4.TRS(Vector3(0,0,0), 
   Quaternion.Euler(X, Y, Z), Vector3(1, 1, 1));
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Gimbal lock.png|200px|thumb|left|Gimbal lock: the axes of two gimbals are parallel.]]
==Gimbal Lock==
One interesting feature of Euler angles (and one reason why Unity and most other graphics applications don't use them internally) is that they can result in a situation that is called “gimbal lock”. In this situation, two of the rotation axes are parallel and, therefore, only two different rotation axes are used. In other words, one degree of freedom is lost. This happens with Unity's Euler angles if the 2nd rotation (elevation) is X = ±90°. In this case, the z axis is rotated onto the y axis; thus, the (rotated) first rotation axis is the same as the (fixed) third rotation axis. 

The situation is easily constructed with the script from above if you set the elevation angle to 90° or -90°.

[[File:Rollpitchyawrob.jpg|200px|thumb|right|An articulated robot: the rotations about z, y, and x are referred to as yaw, pitch, and roll. (In the main text, these axes are labeled y, x, and z.)]]
==Moving Rotation Axes==
In some cases, for example robotics, it is more interesting to work with moving rotation axes (i.e. intrinsic rotations) instead of the fixed rotation axes (i.e. extrinsic rotations) discussed so far. Usually, the rotation relative to the base of the robot is referred to as “yaw”, the up-down rotation of the arm as “pitch”, and the next rotation as “roll”. Since the joints are rotated by each rotation, a description of rotations with moving rotation axes is required.

Fortunately, there is a simple equivalence: the extrinsic rotations specified by Z, X, and Y correspond to the following three intrinsic rotations (in this order): a rotation about the y axis by Y (“yaw”), a rotation about the rotated x axis by X (“pitch”), and a rotation about the rotated z axis by Z (“roll”). In other words, the rotation angles for moving rotation axes are the same as for fixed rotation axes if they are applied in reverse order (Y, X, Z instead of Z, X, Y). For most people, this equivalence is not intuitive at all; however, you might gain a better understanding by playing with the following script that lets you specify yaw, pitch, and roll.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
#pragma strict

public var yawY : float;
public var pitchX : float;
public var rollZ :float;

function Update() 
{
   transform.localEulerAngles = 
      Vector3(pitchX, yawY, rollZ);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Axis.png|200px|thumb|right|Aircraft principal axes: yaw, pitch, and roll.]]

==Roll, Pitch, and Yaw in Aviation==
Roll, pitch, and yaw are also used to describe the orientation of vehicles; see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#Frames_mounted_on_vehicles Wikipedia article on “Axes Conventions”]. Moreover, the principal axes of an aircraft are also called roll (z axis in Unity), pitch (x axis in Unity), and yaw (y axis in Unity). These axes are always fixed to the aircraft; thus, rolling, pitching, and yawing always refers to rotations about these aircraft principal axes regardless of the orientation of the aircraft. The mathematics of these rotations is therefore different from the Euler angles of the same name. In fact, the rotation about aircraft principal axes is more similar to the rotation about arbitrary axes discussed next.

==Rotation about an Axis by an Angle==
As mentioned in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}, the rotation matrix for a rotation about a normalized axis &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; by an angle α is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{rotation}}(x,y,z,\alpha) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
(1-\cos\alpha) x\,x + \cos\alpha    &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) x\,y - z \sin\alpha   &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) z\,x + y \sin\alpha  &amp; 0 \\
(1-\cos\alpha) x\,y + z \sin\alpha  &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) y\,y + \cos\alpha     &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) y\,z - x \sin\alpha  &amp; 0 \\
(1-\cos\alpha) z\,x - y \sin\alpha  &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) y\,z + x \sin\alpha   &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) z\,z + \cos\alpha    &amp; 0 \\
0                                   &amp; 0                                    &amp; 0                                   &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Fortunately, this matrix is almost never needed when working with Unity. Instead, the object's local “rotation” can be set to a rotation about &lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; in degrees in this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
#pragma strict

public var angle : float;
public var axis : Vector3;

function Update() 
{
   transform.localRotation = 
      Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, axis);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Actually, this sets the orientation of the object relative to its parent (or to the world if there is no parent). In order to rotate about a given axis at a given angular velocity in degrees per second, the function &lt;code&gt;Transform.Rotate&lt;/code&gt; can be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
#pragma strict

public var degreesPerSecond : float;
   // angular speed
public var axis : Vector3;

function Update() 
{
   transform.Rotate(axis, 
      degreesPerSecond * Time.deltaTime,
      Space.Self);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;degreesPerSecond&lt;/code&gt; is an angular speed, which specifies how fast the object is rotating. However, &lt;code&gt;Transform.Rotate&lt;/code&gt; requires the rotation angle in degrees. To compute this angle, the angular speed has to be multiplied with the time (in seconds) that has passed since the last call to &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;Time.deltaTime&lt;/code&gt;.

Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;Transform.Rotate&lt;/code&gt; takes a third argument that specifies the coordinate system in which the rotation axis is specified: either &lt;code&gt;Space.Self&lt;/code&gt; for the object's local coordinate system or &lt;code&gt;Space.World&lt;/code&gt; for the world coordinate system. With &lt;code&gt;Space.Self&lt;/code&gt; we can easily simulate rolling, pitching, and yawing by specifying the axes (1,0,0) for pitching,(0,1,0) for yawing, and (0,0,1) for rolling.
 
==Quaternions==
As you might have noticed in the code above, Unity is using quaternions (actually normalized quaternions) to represent rotations. For example, the variable &lt;code&gt;Transform.localRotation&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;Quaternion&lt;/code&gt;. 

In some sense, quaternions are simply four-dimensional vectors with some special functions. Normalized quaternions of length 1 correspond to rotations and are easy to construct when you know the normalized rotation axis (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and the rotation angle α. The corresponding quaternion ''q'' is just:

&lt;math&gt;q = (x_q, y_q, z_q, w_q) = (x \sin(\alpha/2), y \sin(\alpha/2), z \sin(\alpha/2), \cos(\alpha/2))&lt;/math&gt;

In Unity, however, you can just use the constructor &lt;code&gt;Quaternion.AngleAxis(alpha, Vector3(x, y, z))&lt;/code&gt; with alpha in degrees to construct the normalized quaternion. (See the previous subsection for an example.)

Conversely, a normalized quaternion ''q'' with components &lt;math&gt;(x_q, y_q, z_q, w_q)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a rotation by the angle &lt;math&gt;2 \arccos(w_q)&lt;/math&gt;. The direction of the rotation axis can be determined by normalizing the 3D vector &lt;math&gt;(x_q, y_q, z_q)&lt;/math&gt;. In Unity, you can use the function &lt;code&gt;Quaternion.ToAngleAxis&lt;/code&gt; to compute the corresponding axis and angle.

As normalized quaternions correspond to rotations, they also correspond to rotation matrices. In fact, the product of two normalized quaternions corresponds to the product of the corresponding rotation matrices in the same order. Computing the product of two quaternions is actually a bit tricky but in Unity you can just use the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator. In the case of products of quaternions (and also inverse quaternions), it is therefore useful to think of a quaternion as “something like a rotation matrix” instead of a four-dimensional vector.

For example, the code for the rotation at a given angular speed about an axis in the object's local coordinate system would require to multiply — in this order — the previous rotation matrix (which specifies the previous orientation) with the new (incremental) rotation matrix. The quaternion for the previous orientation is &lt;code&gt;transform.localRotation&lt;/code&gt; and the new incremental quaternion is called &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; in this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
#pragma strict
 
public var degreesPerSecond : float;
   // angular speed
public var axis : Vector3;
 
function Update() 
{
   var q : Quaternion = Quaternion.AngleAxis(
      degreesPerSecond * Time.deltaTime, axis);
   transform.localRotation = 
      transform.localRotation * q;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the quaternion product in the last line is changed to
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
   transform.localRotation = 
      q * transform.localRotation;
&lt;/source&gt;
it corresponds to applying the incremental rotation in the parent's coordinate system (or the world's coordinate system if there is no parent) just like one would expect for applying a rotation matrix after transforming the vertices into the parent's coordinate system. (Remember that matrix products should be read from right to left because column vectors are multiplied from the right.) 

At least in computer graphics, (normalized) quaternions are therefore rather harmless and never more complicated than rotation matrices or axis-angle representations (depending on the context). Their specific advantages are that they show no gimbal lock (as opposed to Euler angles), they can be easily combined by multiplication (as opposed to Euler angles and the angle-axis representation of rotations), and they are easy to normalize (as opposed to the orthogonalization of rotation matrices). Therefore, most graphics applications use quaternions internally to represent rotations — even if Euler angles are used in the user interface.

== Summary ==
In this rather theoretical tutorial, we have looked at:
* Unity's Euler angles for extrinsic rotations (i.e., elevation, heading, and bank).
* Unity's Euler angles for intrinsic rotations (i.e., pitch, yaw, and roll).
* The axis-angle representation of rotations.
* The quaternion representation of rotations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Velvet practical: Part 1 ==
This practical will cover the following items:
* Compile Velvet
* Single end
* K-mer length
* Coverage cut-offs
* Whole genome sequence as input???

=== Prepare the environment ===

First make sure that you are in your home directory by typing:

'''cd'''

and making absolutely sure you're there by typing:

'''pwd'''

Now create sub-directories for this and the two other velvet practicals. All these directories will be made as sub-directories of a directory for the whole course called NGS. For this you can use the following commands:

'''mkdir -p NGS/velvet/{part1,part2,part3}'''

 # The -p tells mkdir (make directory) not to worry if a parent directory is missing.
 # That is, if a sub-diectory cannot be made because its parent directory does not exist,
 # just make the parent directory  first rather than reporting an error.
 # The “one at a time” approach would be:
 mkdir NGS
 mkdir NGS/velvet
 mkdir NGS/velvet/part1
 mkdir NGS/velvet/part2
 mkdir NGS/velvet/part3

After creating the directories, examine the structure and move into the directory ready for the first velvet exercise by typing:

'''ls -R NGS;

'''cd NGS/velvet/part1; pwd;'''

=== Downloading and Compile Velvet ===
You can find the latest version of velvet at:
	
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/

You could go to this URL and download the latest velvet version, or equivalently, you could type the following, which will download, unpack, inspect, compile and execute your locally compiled version of velvet:

&lt;code&gt;'cd ~/NGS/velvet/part1; pwd;

cp ~/NGS/Data/velvet_1.2.07.tgz . ;

tar xzf ~/NGS/Data/velvet_1.2.07.tgz;

ls -R; cd velvet_1.2.07;

make velveth velvetg;

./velveth''' &lt;/code&gt;

Take a look at the executables you have created. They will be displayed as green by the command:

&lt;code&gt; ls --color=always; &lt;/code&gt;

 The switch '''--color''', instructs that files be coloured according to their type.
 This is often the default. Here we are just being cautious. 
 The '''=always''' is included as colouring is usually suppressed in scripts.
 If you run this exercise using the script provided, just '''--color''' would not be enough.
 '''--color=always''' insists on file colouring even from a script.

Have a look of the output the command produces and you will see the following parameters passed into the compiler:

'''“MAXKMERLENGTH=31”''' and '''“CATEGORIES=2”'''

This indicates that the default compilation was set for De Bruijn graph KMERs of maximum size 31 and to allow a maximum of just 2 read categories. You can override these, and other, default configuration choices using command line parameters. Assume, you want to run velvet with a KMER length of 41 using 3 categories, velvet needs to be recompiled to enable this functionality by typing:

&lt;code&gt; make clean; make velveth velvetg MAXKMERLENGTH=41 CATEGORIES=3;
./velveth &lt;/code&gt;

velvet can also be used to process SOLID colour space data. To do this you need a further make parameter. With the following command clean away your last compilation and try the following parameters:

&lt;code&gt; make clean; make MAXKMERLENGTH=41 CATEGORIES=3 color
./velveth_de &lt;/code&gt;

For a further description of velvet compile and runtime parameters please see the velvet Manual: https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet/wiki/Manual

== Single ended read assembly ==
 The data you will examine is from '''''Staphylococcus aureus''''' USA300 which has a genome of around 3MB.
 The reads are  Illumina and are unpaired, also known as single-end library. 
 Even though you have carefully installed velvet in your own  workspace, we will use a pre-installed version. 
 The data needed for this section can be obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). 
 For the following example use the run data SRR022825 and SRR022823 from the SRA Sample SRS004748.
 The SRA experiment could be viewed by setting your browser to the URL:
 	
 '''http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRS004748'''

The following exercise focuses on velvet using single-end reads, how the available parameters effect an assembly and how to measure and compare the changes.
To begin with, first move back to the directory you prepared for this exercise, create a new folder with a suitable name for this part and move into it. The command to download the file from the internet would be:

&lt;code&gt; wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR022/SRR022825/SRR022825.fastq.gz &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt; wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR022/SRR022823/SRR022823.fastq.gz &lt;/code&gt;

or if you had the files installed locally, just create soft links to the files. Continue by copying (or typing):

&lt;code&gt; cd ~/NGS/velvet/part1

mkdir SRS004748 

cd SRS004748

pwd

ln -s ~/NGS/Data/SRR022825.fastq.gz . 

ln -s ~/NGS/Data/SRR022823.fastq.gz . 

ls -l

&lt;/code&gt;

 You are ready to process your data with velvet, which is a compressed fastq file. Velvet has two main components:
 velveth -used to construct, from raw read data, a dataset organised in the fashion expected by the second component, velvetg.
 velvetg -the core of velvet where the de Bruijn graph assembly is built and manipulated.
 You can always get further information about the usage of both velvet programs by typing velvetg or velveth in your terminal.

Now run velveth for the reads in '''SRR022825.fastq.gz''' and '''SRR022823.fastq.gz''' using the following options:

	- A de Bruijn graph k-mer of 25 

	- An output directory called run_25

&lt;code&gt; velveth run_25 25 -fastq.gz -short SRR022825.fastq.gz SRR022823.fastq.gz &lt;/code&gt;

'''velveth''' talks to itself for a while and ends with some files in the output directory. Move into the output directory '''run_25''' and take a look around at what '''velveth''' had done so far. The UNIX command less allows you to look at output files (press q for quit). Just in case you still need a hint:

&lt;code&gt; cd run_25; 

ls -l;

head Sequences;
&lt;/code&gt;

Now move one directory level up and run velvetg on your output directory, with the commands:

&lt;code&gt; cd ..

time velvetg run_25 &lt;/code&gt;

Move back into your results directory to examine the effects of velvetg:

&lt;code&gt; cd run_25; ls -l; &lt;/code&gt;

FOR YOU: once you run the command above:
*Q1: What extra files do you see in the folder run_25?
*Q2:What do you suppose they might represent?
*Q3: In the Log file in run_25, what is the N50?

 N50 statistic: Broadly, it is the median (not average) of a sorted data set using the length of a set of sequences.
 Usually it is the length of the contig whose length.
 When added to the length of all longer contigs, makes a total greater that half the sum of the lengths of all contigs. 
 Easy, but messy – a more formal definition can be found here:
 	
 http://www.broadinstitute.org/crd/wiki/index.php/N50

Backup the contigs.fa file and calculate the N50 (and the N25,N75) value with the command:

&lt;cpde cp contigs.fa contigs.fa.0 &lt;/code&gt;

YOU now try:

&lt;code gnx -min 100 -nx 25,50,75 contigs.fa &lt;/code&gt;

*Q4. Does the value of N50 agree with the value stored in the Log file?	
*Q5. If not, why do you think this might be?

 In order to improve our results, take a closer look at the standard options of velvetg by typing 'velvetg' without parameters.
 For the moment focus on the two options -cov_cutoff and -exp_cov. 
 Clearly -cov_cutoff will allow you to exclude contigs for which the kmer coverage is low, implying unacceptably poor quality. 
 The -exp_cov switch is used to give velvetg an idea of the coverage to expect. 
 If the expected coverage of any contig is substantially in excess of the suggested expected value,
 maybe this would indicate a repeat. 
 For further details of how to choose the parameters, go to 'Choice of a coverage cutoff': 	
   http://wiki.github.com/dzerbino/velvet/

Briefly, the '''Kmer''' coverage (and much more information) for each contig is stored in the file '''stats.txt''' and can be used with R to visualize the coverage distribution. Take a look at the '''stats.txt''' file, start R, load and visualize the data using the following commands:

&lt;code&gt; R

library(plotrix) 

data &lt;- read.table(&quot;stats.txt&quot;, header=TRUE)

x11()

weighted.hist(data$short1_cov, data$lgth, breaks=0:50)&lt;/code&gt;

A weighted histogram is a better way of visualizing the coverage information, because of noise (lot of very short contigs). You can see an example output below:

[[File:DeNovoVelvet Fig1.JPG|thumb|left|Figure1: weight histogram showing the coverage information]]

After choosing the expected coverage and the coverage cut-off, you can exit R by typing:

&lt;code&gt; q()

n
&lt;/code&gt;

 The weighted histogram suggests to me that the expected coverage is around 14 and that everything below 6 is likely to be noise. 
 Some coverage is also represented at around 20, 30 and greater 50, which might be contamination or repeats (depending on the dataset), but at the moment this should not worry you. 
 To see the improvements, rerun velvetg first with -cov_cutoff 6 and after checking the N50 use only / add -exp_cov 14 to the command line option. 
 Also keep a copy of the contigs file for comparison:

&lt;code&gt; cd ~/NGS/velvet/part1/SRS004748
time velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6
# Make a copy of the run
cp run_25/contigs.fa run_25/contigs.fa.1

time velvetg run_25 -exp_cov 14
cp run_25/contigs.fa run_25/contigs.fa.2

time velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6 -exp_cov 14
cp run_25/contigs.fa run_25/contigs.fa.3
&lt;/code&gt;

* Q6.What is the N50 with no parameter:	
* Q7.What is the N50 with -cov_cutoff 6:	
* Q8.What is the N50 with -exp_cov 14:	
* Q9.What is the N50 with -cov_cutoff 6 -exp_cov 14:	
* Q10Did you notice a variation in the time velvetg took to run? If so, can you explain why that might be?

You were running velvetg with the given '''-exp_cov''' and '''-cov_cutoff''' parameters. Now try to experiment using different cut-offs, expected parameters and also explore other settings (e.g. -max_coverage, -max_branch_length, -unused_reads, -amos_file, -read_trkg or see velvetg help menu).

 In particular, look at the -amos_file parameter which instructs velvetg to create a version of the assembly that can be
 processed and viewed with a program called AMOS Hawkeye. 
 Another  program, called tablet, can also understand and display the AMOS file. 
 For now, we will take a look at tablet.

Run velvetg with just -cov_cutoff 6 but requesting an amos file:

&lt;code&gt; velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6 -amos_file yes &lt;/code&gt;

Now take a swift look at the assembly with tablet:

&lt;code&gt; tablet run_25/velvet_asm.afg &amp; &lt;/code&gt;

velvet_asm.afg being the file velvetg made is response to the inclusion of the -amos_file yes switch. tablet will take quite a bit of memory and you can safely ignore the complaints from tablet. Once the file has loaded, select one of the longer contigs.
Note the lack of Read information and the one dimensional nature of the contig display. Close down tablet when you have seen enough.
Now rerun velvetg adding the additional parameter -exp_cov 7 with no need to save any files as the amos file needs to be changed.
Now rerun velvetg adding the additional parameter -exp_cov 14 with no need to save any files as the AMOS file needs to be changed.

&lt;code&gt; velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6 -exp_cov 14 -amos_file yes &lt;/code&gt;

Again, view the amos file with tablet:

&lt;code&gt; tablet run_25/velvet_asm.afg &amp; &lt;/code&gt;

Select a longish contig as before and explore the display options before close down table.
FOR YOU:
*Q11. Why do you think there was read information only for the second use of tablet?	
*Q12. You may have noticed velvetg took a little longer with -exp_cov 14 on. Does this make sense ?

If you want to explore the behaviour of velvet even further, you could experiment with the following.

Reduce the sequence coverage by only choosing one input file for the assembly e.g. SRR022825.fastq.gz

Increase the sequence coverage by downloading further files from the same ENA sample SRS004748 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRS004748).

FOR YOU: How did the N50 change by 
*Q13. reducing the coverage?	
*Q14. increasing the coverage?

'''Preface''' 

''for Nicole Delaittre''

This book is about the inverse problems that take its roots in medical imaging such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and similar imaging methods from geophysics with applications to the oil &amp; gas production industry. The study was motivated by the practical needs of non-destructive and non-intrusive methods for imaging of hidden objects such as internal human/animal organs or Earth's natural resources.

The inverse problems are formulated as the mathematical problems of recovering the coefficients of differential/difference systems of equations from data about their solutions. These problems are opposite in some sense to the forward problems of evaluating functions. The study of the inverse problems is well suited for computer simulations and many classical and current mathematical problems can be restated with ease as inverse problems. 

The techniques of study and solutions of the inverse problems considered in this book allow one to &quot;see inside&quot; the objects using data about the sound waves and electro-magnetic fields observed at the boundary or outside the object.

The following construction plays an important role in studying the graphs properly embedded into surfaces. One considers an embedded into a [[Wikipedia:Surface | surface]] (2D manifold) finite graph w/vertices each w/exactly four neighbors. The union of edges of such graph is equal to a union of closed curves on the surface, called '''geodesics'''. The faces of the graph can be two-colored. 

[[File:Morphedchessboard(1).jpg|thumb|Example of a medial graph on a surface]]

The corresponding graph ''G'' and its dual ''G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be obtained by putting vertices in all faces of the same color and connecting two vertices by an edge if the corresponding faces of the [[Wikipedia:Medial graph| medial graph]] ''M(G)'' have a common corner. Note that ''M(G)=M(G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''.

One cam modify the construction accordingly for the case of an embedded graph w/boundary by allowing vertices of the medial graph to have one neighbor.

The following transformations of the geodesics of the medial graph ''M(G)'' are similar to the [[Wikipedia:Reidemeister move | Reidemeister moves]] of the knot theory. They correspond to the ''Y-Δ'' transformations of the graph ''G'' and ''G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''.

[[File:Geodesics moves (1).jpg|450px|center |The three moves of geodesics curves]]

The following matrix consists of the distances (the smallest number of jumps across the geodesics or the edge distance in ''M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(G)'') between boundary faces of the medial graph below.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 1  &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 0  &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 1  &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 \\
 3 &amp; 2  &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
 2 &amp; 3  &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 3 &amp; 4  &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 3  &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 2  &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Medial graphs (1).jpg|center|500px |Two examples of boundary isometric medial graphs with 4 and 5 geodesics]]

'''Exercise (*).''' Prove that the distances between boundary faces of an embedded medial graph are invariant under the geodesics moves.

The geodesics of the medial graph form an arrangement of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoline#Other_types_of_arrangement| pseudo-lines] if 

* none of them intersect itself
* none of them is a closed curve
* no two of them intersect more than once

'''Exercise (***).''' Prove that ''(a)'' one can recover a planar medial graph ''M(G)'', up to the moves, from the distances between its boundary faces, ''(b)'' every planar medial graph ''M(G)'' can be moved into an arrangement of pseudo-lines without changing the distance matrix.

(Hint). Look for the pattern
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
k+1 &amp; k \\
k &amp; k+1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

in the matrix of boundary distances.

The following min-cut max-flow result was formulated w/help of Derek Jerina, a student of REU summer school on inverse problems at the University of Washington.

'''Exercise (**).''' Prove that the ranks of submatrices of the matrix of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of a planar graph w/natural boundary determine the shortest distances between the boundary faces of its medial graph, and therefore determine the planar graph up to a finite sequence of [[On 2D Inverse Problems/Y-Δ and star-mesh transforms|Y-Δ transformations]].

(Hint.) It follows from the determinant identity in the section [[On 2D Inverse Problems/Special matrices| Special matrices]] that the ranks of the submatrices count the numbers of disjoint paths connecting boundary nodes of the planar graph.

It was proved in [DeV1], [DeV2], [GDV] and [CIM] that if the medial graph of a planar network w/natural boundary is an arrangement of pseudo-lines then the conductivities of its edges are uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and can be found by a layer stripping algorithm.

Let &lt;math&gt;\{a_k\}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of ''n'' positive numbers. The Stieltjes [[Wikipedia: Continued fraction| continued fraction]] is an expression of the form, see [KK] &amp; also [JT],

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_a(z) = a_nz + \cfrac{1}{a_{n-1}z + \cfrac{1}{ \ddots + \cfrac{1}{a_1 z} }}&lt;/math&gt;

or its reciprocal

: &lt;math&gt;\beta^*_a(z) = \frac{1}{\beta_a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function defines a rational ''n''-to-''1'' map of the right half of the complex plane onto itself, 

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_a,1/\beta_a:\mathbb{C^+}\xrightarrow[]{n\leftrightarrow 1}\mathbb{C^+},&lt;/math&gt;

since

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
Re(z_1), Re(z_2) &gt; 0 \implies Re(z_1+z_2) &gt; 0, \\
Re(z) \implies Re(1/z) &gt; 0, \\
Re(z) &gt; 0, a &gt; 0 \implies Re(az) &gt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise(***).''' Use the mapping properties of a Stieltjes continued fractions to prove that it's a rational functions w/a zero or a pole at the origin w/simple, symmetric, interlacing zeros and poles lying on the imaginary axes and that the above properties characterize the continued fractions.

'''Exercise(**).''' Prove that the continued fractions have the following representation:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\beta_a(z) = z(\xi_{\infty} + \sum_k\frac{\xi_k}{z^2+\theta_k^2}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;
\xi_{\infty}, \xi_k \mbox{ and } \theta_k, k\in\mathbb{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

are non-negative real numbers and the converse of the statement is true.

The function &lt;math&gt;\beta_a&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the pre-image set &lt;math&gt;\Mu=\{\mu_k\}&lt;/math&gt; (of size ''n'', counting multiplicities) of the point {''z = 1''}, since

: &lt;math&gt;
\beta_a(z) = \frac{p(z^2)}{zq(z^2)}=1 \iff p(z^2)-zq(z^2) = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

and a complex polynomial is determined by its roots up to a multiplicative constant by the ''fundamental theorem of algebra''.

Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma_l&lt;/math&gt; be the elementary symmetric functions of the set &lt;math&gt;\Mu&lt;/math&gt;. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_k (z-\mu_k) = \sum_k \sigma_{n-k} z^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; of the continued fraction are the pivots in the [[Wikipedia:Gauss-Jordan elimination| Gauss-Jordan elimination]] algorithm of the following ''n'' by ''n'' square [[Wikipedia:Hurwitz matrix|Hurwitz matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt; H_\Mu = \begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; \sigma_5 &amp; \sigma_7 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_4 &amp; \sigma_6&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; \sigma_5&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_4&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots&amp; \ddots&amp; \vdots\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0&amp; \ldots&amp; \sigma_n\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and, therefore, can be expressed as the ratios of monomials of the determinants of the blocks of &lt;math&gt;\Mu&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Exercise (**).''' Prove that 

:&lt;math&gt;
a_1 = 1/ \sigma_1, 

a_2 = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\det\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3
\\ 1 &amp; \sigma_2
\end{pmatrix}},

a_3 = \frac{\det
\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 
\\ 1 &amp; \sigma_2 \end{pmatrix}^2}{\sigma_1\det
\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; 0 
\\ 1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_4 
\\ 0 &amp; \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3
\end{pmatrix}}, \ldots
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Exercise (*).''' Use the previous exercise to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_k a_k = \frac{1}{\prod_k \mu_k} = 1/\sigma_n.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (**).''' Let ''A'' be a diagonal matrix with the alternating in sign diagonal entries: 
: &lt;math&gt;
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
 \pm a_1     &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; \mp a_2 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 \vdots    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; -a_{n-1} &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; 0  &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; a_n \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''D'' the ''(0,1)''-matrix

:&lt;math&gt;
D =
\begin{pmatrix}
 0     &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 1     &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; 1 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 \vdots    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0     &amp; 0  &amp; \ldots &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
.
&lt;/math&gt;

Prove that

: &lt;math&gt;
\beta_a(\mu) = 1 \iff \mu \in \sigma(A^{-1}D) = \sigma(DA^{-1}).
&lt;/math&gt;

That is 

: &lt;math&gt;
const(p(z^2)-zq(z^2)) = \rho_{A^{-1}D}(z)=\rho_{DA^{-1}}(z).
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (*).''' Find the constant in the equation above.

== [[ User:Daviddaved/Summary | Summary ]] ==

: The main object of study of this book is the relationship between local and global properties of two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces) and embedded graphs. The dimension of the unknown parameter fits the dimension of the data of the measurements in several important instances of the inverse problems. Also, two-dimensional setting has an additional structure, due to the duality between harmonic functions on embedded graphs and manifolds and the connection to special matrices. The context of the inverse problems provides a unified point of view on the work of many great mathematicians. Some of the problems simplify significantly in the graph theoretical setting, but their solutions nevertheless convey the main ideas of the solutions for their continuous analogs. These are some of the main motivations for writing this book. Even though there are references to many mathematical areas in this book, it is practically self-contained, and is intended for the use by a wide audience of people interested in the subject.

Let ''a_i'' be a set of ''n'' points in the complex unit disc.
The corresponding '''Blaschke product''' is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;B(z)=\prod_k\frac{|a_k|}{a_k}(\frac{a_k-z}{1-\overline{a_k}z}).&lt;/math&gt;

If the set of points is finite, the function defines the ''n''-to-''1'' map of the unit disc onto itself, 

:&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{D}\xrightarrow[]{n\leftrightarrow 1}\mathbb{D}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the set of points is infinite, the product converges and defines an automorphism of the complex unit disc, given the Blaschke condition 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_k (1-|a_k|) &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The following fact will be useful in our calculations:

Let ''{b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}'' be a set of ''n'' points in the complex unit disc ''D''. The corresponding [[Wikipedia:Blaschke product| Blaschke product]] is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;B_b(z)=\prod_k\frac{|b_k|}{b_k}(\frac{b_k-z}{1-\overline{b_k}z}).&lt;/math&gt;

If the set of points is finite, the function defines the ''n''-to-''1'' map of the unit disc onto itself, 

: &lt;math&gt;B_b:\mathbb{D}\xrightarrow[]{n\leftrightarrow 1}\mathbb{D}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\Delta(\Omega)} = \{\lambda_k\} &lt;/math&gt; be the set of Dirichlet eigenvalues for the domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the set of [[Wikipedia:Eigenvalues| eigenvalues]] of the following [[Wikipedia:Dirichlet problem| Dirichlet problem]] for the [[Wikipedia:Laplace operator| Laplace operator]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\Delta u + \lambda u = 0, \\
u|_{\partial \Omega} = 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the system above is self-adjoint, the eigenvalues are positive. Two domains are said to be '''[[isospectral]]''' if they have the same Laplacian eigenvalues. One can then state the inverse problem of describing the equivalence classes of the isospectral relationship, that is the question in the title of this section, see [K], and its discrete analog for networks:

Let

: &lt;math&gt;L(G)=\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; C \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

be the '''[[Wikipedia:Kirchhoff matrix| Kirchhoff matrix]]''' of a network ''G'' w/boundary w/''N'' interior vertices. The submatrix ''C'' is semi-positive definite and, therefore, has the singular value decomposition:

: &lt;math&gt;
C = VDV^{-1}=VDV^T=\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_k v_k v_k^T
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the matrix of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;
\Lambda(G) = A - BC^{-1}B^T = A - (BV)D^{-1}(BV)^T = A - \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{Bv_k (Bv_k)^T}{\lambda_k}.
&lt;/math&gt; 

The matrix ''A'' contains the information about connections bw/boundary nodes of the network ''G'', the diagonal matrix ''D'' has the '''[[Laplacian eigenvalues]]''' of the network ''G'' on its diagonal, and the vectors ''Bv&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are discrete analogs of normal derivatives of the Laplacian eigenvalues of ''G''. The matrix of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is, therefore, completely determined by the these vectors and matrices.

'''Exercise (*).''' Prove that the inverse problem with the boundary and spectral data, described above, can be reduced to the inverse problem of Calderon.

The construction in the section [[User:Daviddaved/Printed Version/Two new spectral theorems|&quot;Two   spectral theorems&quot;]] provides a counterexample for uniqueness in an inverse spectral problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following physical model of a vibrating inhomogeneous string (or string w/with beads) by Krein provides mechanical interpretation for the study of [[On 2D Inverse Problems/Stieltjes continued fractions| continued fractions]], see [GK]. The model is one-dimensional, and  it arises as a restriction of ''n''-dimensional inverse problems with rotational symmetry.

The string is represented by a non-decreasing positive mass function ''m(x)'' on a possibly infinite interval ''[0, l]''. The right end of the string is fixed. The ratio of the forced oscillation to an applied periodic force @ the left end of the string is the function of frequency, called coefficient of '''dynamic compliance''' of the string, see [KK] and [I2].

The small vertical vibration of the string is described by the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\rho(x)}\frac{\partial^2 f(x,\lambda)}{\partial x^2}=\lambda f(x, \lambda),
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho(x) = \frac{dm}{dx}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the density of the string, possibly including atomic masses. One can express the coefficient in terms of the fundamental solution of the ODE:

: &lt;math&gt;
H(\lambda) = \frac{f'(0,\lambda)}{f(0,\lambda)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt; f(l,\lambda) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

A fundamental theorem of Krein and Kac, see [KK] &amp; also [I2], essentially states that an analytic function H(&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient of dynamic compliance of a string if and only if the function 

: &lt;math&gt;
\beta(\lambda) = \lambda H(-\lambda^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

is an analytic automorphism of the right half-plane ''C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'', that is real on the real line. The theorem of Herglotz completely characterizes such functions by the following integral representation:

&lt;math&gt;
\beta(\lambda) = \sigma_{\infty}\lambda + \frac{\sigma_0}{\lambda} + \int_0^{\infty}\frac{\lambda(1+x^2)d\sigma(x)}{\lambda^2+x^2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where,

&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a positive [[Wikipedia:Measure (mathematics)| measure]] of bounded variation on the half-line &lt;math&gt;(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise(**).''' Use the theorem above, Fourier transform and a change of variables to characterize the set of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for a unit disc with rotation independent conductivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following inverse problem stated by Calderon has many potential practical applications and had received a lot of attention in the past decades, see [Uh]. This is the problem of recovering the conductivity of a body from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. 

Given a domain with positive measurable function on it, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator connects the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-harmonic functions in &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, defined on the domain. It is a pseudo-differential operator of order ''1''.

: &lt;math&gt;
\Lambda:H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)\rightarrow H^{-1/2}(\partial\Omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

One can only recover one number (an integral of reciprocal of conductivity) in 1D.
The problem is overdetermined in dimensions higher than ''2''. It was settled in these cases @ [KV] &amp; [SU].

The dimensions of the measurement parameter and the unknown one fit precisely in the case of 2D. It was recently proved that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map uniquely determines the conductivity in a 2D simply connected bounded domain if the conductivity is in a weighted space including differentiable functions in [N], and if it's measurable and bounded from ''0'' and infinity in [AP].

: &lt;math&gt;
0 &lt; 1/c &lt; \gamma &lt; c &lt; \infty.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the ''2D'' case one can make sense of the operator for '''measurable''' conductivities (vs. differentiable), (see [AP]), using the [[Wikipedia:Hilbert transform| Hilbert transform]], defined later in the book, b/w the boundary values of harmonic functions and their conjugates.

In this book the problem is also stated for the planar electrical networks, that allows a different approach for solution of the inverse problem through discretization technique, that was implemented by Druskin et al. @ Schlumberger-Doll Research, see [BDK] and [BDMV].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Exercise Recommendations - Post Cardiac Transplant=

==Background==

A cardiac transplant involves the surgical placement of a donor’s healthy heart into the recipient with end-stage heart disease. Some diseases linked with heart transplants are those such as cardiomyopathy and heart failure.&lt;ref&gt; Cardiothoracic Surgery - Patient’s Guide to Heart Transplant Surgery http://www.cts.usc.edu/ht-pg-exercise.html &lt;/ref&gt;  

Heart Transplants are surgeries of life-saving technology which was started as a radical experimental surgery in 1984 which now plays a detrimental role in end-stage heart disease patients.  Since 1984, The St. Vincent’s Hospital of Sydney, The Royal Children’s in Melbourne, Royal Perth Hospital, and The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane and The Alfred in Melbourne have offered heart transplant programs.&lt;ref&gt; The international society of heart and lung transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients – Long term care of heart transplant recipients. (Aug 6, 2010) http://www.ishlt.org &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Benefits of Exercise==

Exercise can assist post-cardiac transplant recipients by: &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Decreased''' blood lactate concentrations at the given work rate
:* '''Improved''' aerobic characteristics of skeletal muscle
:* '''Improved''' endothelial function
:* '''Decreased''' resting heart rate and blood pressure
:* '''Increased''' VO2 peak and VO2 at ventilator threshold 
:* '''Increased''' muscle force production
:* '''Increased''' bone mineral density 
:* '''Prevention''' of steroid-induced muscle wasting and weakness



Cardiac Transplant patients can have decreased results post surgery if:&lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Inactivity before surgery
:* Reduced aerobic characteristics of skeletal muscle
:* Decreased skeletal muscle mass and force production
:* Pulmonary diffusion abnormalities
:* Left ventricular dysfunction

==Resistance and Cardiovascular Exercise Guidelines==

Recommended exercise programs are progressive and aimed in:&lt;ref&gt; The international society of heart and lung transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients – Long term care of heart transplant recipients. (Aug 6, 2010) http://www.ishlt.org &lt;/ref&gt;
:* improving cardiorespiratory fitness 
:* improve muscle endurance and force production
:* re-establish self efficacy and improve quality of life

===Resistance Training Goals===
:* Low to moderate intensity exercise; 1-2 sets of 10-15reps &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 2-4 days per week &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Arm exercises should not be started until full healing after sternotomy (2 months) &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Within 2 months of surgery; patients should feel increased muscle strength and endurance of the legs; and beginning resistance work on the upper body &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerobic Training Goals===
:* 15 – 60 minute sessions &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 4 -7 days per week at 40-80% VO2 max &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* After 6 months, recipients should have increase cardiovascular fitness and improvements against risk factors such as insulin sensitivity etc. &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations and Precautions==
While research has shown the safety of resistance and cardiovascular exercises; professional advice should be taken:&lt;ref&gt; Cardiothoracic Surgery - Patient’s Guide to Heart Transplant Surgery http://www.cts.usc.edu/ht-pg-exercise.html &lt;/ref&gt; 
:* discuss physical activity with your doctor or physiotherapist to determine what may be appropriate 
:* do not exercise or stop immediately if unwell, dizzy, lightheaded, faint, cold sweats, nausea or chest pain 
:* do not begin to exercise if you are having a episode of rejection
:* avoid exercise in extreme temperatures or conditions &lt;ref&gt; The international society of heart and lung transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients – Long term care of heart transplant recipients. (Aug 6, 2010) http://www.ishlt.org &lt;/ref&gt;

Ensure to monitor all medications; as it can cause some disruptions to exercise – seek medical advice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background Information: What is Autism? ==
[[File:Autismbrain.jpg|thumb|Autism as it Effects the Brain]]
Autism is a neurological disorder that occurs across a spectrum of impairments and can include behaviours showing difficulties in social interaction and communication. Typical autism behaviours can also result in self-stimulating and aggressive, repetitive behaviours. Autism is generally known as Autism Spectrum Disorder as specific types of Autism may vary across a spectrum and can include Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder. There are no known causes for Autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;NINDS&quot;&gt; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2012, http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm &lt;/ref&gt;.

Sufferers of Autism face three main areas of difficulty that include: 
* Impairment in social interaction 
* Impairment in communication
* Restricted and repetitive interests, activities and behaviours
Major symptoms of Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders are self-stimulatory behaviours such as nodding, fidgeting and other agitative behaviours. Literature shows that these self-stimulatory behaviours interfere with further development of social behaviours and learning. There are three main diagnoses for a person with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, being Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Development Disorder. Diagnoses varies on the symptoms observed, and key development limitations observed, such as delay in social, communication and behavioural development. Other repetitive and agitative behaviours may be observed..&lt;ref name=&quot;NINDS&quot;&gt; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2012, http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise as Treatment for Autism ==
Whilst Autism is a disorder that can effect an individual's capacity to perform exercise, exercise has been shown to have significant benefits for social interactions, communication skills and repetitive behaviours. Structured aerobic exercise has been proven to provide a major role in controlling self-stimulating behaviours &lt;ref&gt;Watters, A. M., &amp; Watters, W. E. (1980). Decreasing self-stimulatory behavior with physical exercise in a group of autistic boys. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 10, 379–387&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercise in persons with autism has also reduced aggressive behaviours &lt;ref&gt;Allison D.B., Basile V.C., MacDonald R.B. (1991). Brief report: Comparative effects of antecedent exercise and lorazepam on the aggressive behavior of an autistic man. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. 21(1), pp. 89-94&lt;/ref&gt;, self-injurious behaviours,unproductive behaviours and has been shown to improve attention span, work performance and on task behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, J. E., &amp; Fugua, R. W. (1983). Management of inappropriate behaviors of trainable mentally impaired students using antecedent exercise. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 16, 477–484&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise is also used as therapy in persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders to help improve motor skills and sensory integration. These therapies improve the proprioceptive system, vestibular system, motor coordination and skill development.

Persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders also have a greater risk of becoming overweight due to their limited motor functioning. Increasing physical activity in persons with Autism reduces the risk over becoming overweight and other associated comorbidities.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, G., 2012, Sports, Exercise and the Benefits of Physical Activity for Persons with Autism, http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/sports-exercise-and-benefits-physical-activity-individuals-autism &lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Exercise Recommendations for Autism ===
Certain exercise can improve proprioception in persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Developing coordination through exercise activity can assist proprioception and general coordination. Activities to benefit proprioception include swimming, playing with weights, use of a trampoline and pushing or playing with large objects.

Autism sufferers generally reduce self-stimulating behaviour during low (50-65% Maximum Heart Rate) intensity exercise. This reduces self-stimulating behaviours immediately for up to 90 minutes. 10 - 20 minute low intensity exercise sessions up to 5 times a week are proven to be beneficial. &lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, S, Exercise as a Means to Reduce Sterotypic Behaviours Among Children and Adolescents with Autism, 2012, http://youthsports.rutgers.edu/documents/EXERCISING.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Long term benefits from these exercise programs have also been proven.

Exercise therapy recommended also includes activities which stimulate the vestibular system. Whilst each person with autism may have a different reaction to sensory motion, exercises recommended include back and forth movements including trampolining can assist in improving balance and coordination both during exercise and during normal activities &lt;ref&gt;Autism Help, 2012, http://www.autism-help.org/family-physical-exercise-autism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Activities such as swimming and obstacle courses should be prescribed to improve skill development. Obstacle courses with incorporated activities such as skipping, hopscotch and throw and catch can imrove sensory integration and hand eye coordination.

The National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disabilities &lt;ref name=&quot;NCPAID&quot;&gt;National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability, 2012, http://www.ncpad.org/315/1928/Autism~and~Considerations~in~Recreation~and~Physical~Activity~Settings&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests exercise prescription has greatest effect when it is:
* Set up on a consistent routine
* Predictable activity
* Set up with minimal distractions and sensory overload
* Instructed visually not verbally
* Shorter for those with limited concentration
* Safe as individuals may not be aware of risk

=== Limitations and Considerations ===
Considerations to incorporate when prescribing exercise for a person with Autism include: 
Sensory hypoactivity or hyperactivity, which is partly due to the impairment of the sensory cortex, a problem in a large number of individuals who suffer from Autism. This means that exercise programs should incorporate activities that will not distress or alarm the person with Autism. Activities should be prescribed to make the person with Autism feel comfortable at all times.
Communicating exercise prescription to a person with Autism Spectrum Disorder is a further limitation. Visual cues and instructions should be given, to minimise difficulty processing verbal communication. 

Activities should be prescribed as not to overstimulate the Autistic person, as overstimulated can result in increased self-stimulating behaviours and aggressive behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot*, R. O., Dobbin, A. R., Rose, G. D., &amp; Soper, H. V. (1994). Vigorous, aerobic exercise versus general motor training activities: Effects on maladaptive and
stereotypic behaviors of adults with both autism and mental retardation. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 24, 565–576.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Osteoporosis: The Silent Disease ==
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes a reduction in density and quality of bone matrix. These changes cause large increase in the risk of fractures, there are often no signs of osteoporosis until the first fracture.&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;What is Osteoporosis?&quot; Author:iofbonehealth. Retrieved from http:http://www.iofbonehealth.org/what-osteoporosis-0 &lt;/ref&gt;. Osteoporosis is a disease often seen among the elderly. During early adulthood bone matrix is at its most dense, as we age bone matrix is absorbed while new matrix is formed, this is normally an even equation. Unfortunately as we age this equation can become unbalanced leading to a greater pace of bone absorption, this is the cause of osteoporosis.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Osteoporosis, falls and exercise&quot; Author:Agustín Meléndez-Ortega. Retrieved from http://http://http://link.springer.com.ezproxy1.canberra.edu.au/article/10.1007/s11556-007-0027-9/fulltext.html &lt;/ref&gt;.


Men and women over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a Bone Mineral Denisty (BMD) test. The most commonly used BMD test is DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) which can detect changes in bone loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;What is Osteoporosis?&quot; Author:iofbonehealth. Retrieved from http:http://www.iofbonehealth.org/what-osteoporosis-0 &lt;/ref&gt;. Osteoporosis is diagnosed against a set of threshold values created by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Osteoporosis is diagnosed when a person’s BMD is equal to or more than 2.5 standard deviations below this value. &lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;What is Osteoporosis?&quot; Author:iofbonehealth. Retrieved from http:http://www.iofbonehealth.org/what-osteoporosis-0 &lt;/ref&gt;.  
== Connection Between Resistance Training and Osteoporosis ==
[[File:Bone_density_scanner.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Bone density scanner can be used to diagnose osteoporosis]]
Resistance Training has been shown to provide many benefits to athletes although is not of common practice in the older population. Wolff's law states that stress or mechanical loading applied to the bone via the muscle and tendons has a direct effect on bone formation and remodeling. Benefits of resistance training include gains in strength, endurance and maintenance/gains in BMD. These benefits can impact hugely on functionality for the elderly making tasks such as carrying groceries or getting up and down stairs easier to achieve.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;The effects of progressive resistance training on bone density: a review&quot; Author:LAYNE, JENNIFER E.; NELSON, MIRIAM E.. Retrieved from http:http://zh9bf5sp6t.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=JE&amp;aulast=Layne&amp;atitle=The+effects+of+progressive+resistance+training+on+bone+density:+a+review.&amp;id=doi:10.1097/00005768-199901000-00006&amp;title=Medicine+and+science+in+sports+and+exercise&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;date=1999&amp;spage=25&amp;issn=0195-9131 &lt;/ref&gt;. 
 

The goal of resistance training in regards to osteoporosis is to maintain or increase BMD and therefore reduce the chance of suffering a fracture. Resistance training has been shown to improve BMD in site specific areas and should therefore be targeted at areas of high fracture risk such as the hips and lumbar spine. Targeted muscle areas should include all major muscle groups of both lower and upper extremities in order to help increase BMD of all major bones. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Physical approach for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis&quot; Author:Ana Paula Rebucci Lirani-Galvão; Marise Lazaretti-Castro Retrieved from http:http:http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0004-27302010000200013&amp;script=sci_arttext &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Physical Activity Guidelines to Prevent/Manage Osteoporosis ==
[[File:BCRL.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bench Press is one example of resistance exercise]]
When prescribing exercise programs for individuals with high risk of fractures such as those suffering from osteoporosis, with particular emphasis on the elderly, there are certain precautions and tests that should be conduced before undertaking exercise in avoid unforeseen calamities.
 
==== Precautions &amp; Safety Concerns ==== 
* Ensure the individual has sought advice from a medical professional and has been cleared to undertake the program.
* Make sure the individual is under the supervision of a trained instructor to ensure proper use and technique of equipment and exercises are taking place.
* Reduce the risk factors of falls associated in physical activity environments such as dim lights, scattered objects and loose carpet or flooring. 
* Depending on the additional needs of the individual in regards to vision and hearing the use of trochanteric pads may need to be arranged.
* Ensure that any medication taken will not effect or cause risk factors when physical activity is undertaken.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Preventing Falls in the Elderly&quot; Author:K.R. Tremblay Jr, C.E. Barber Retrieved from http:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/consumer/10242.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Recommended Physical Activity ====
When designing exercise programs for individuals with osteoporosis special attention and awareness of their like hood to suffer fractures needs to be kept in mind. Any resistance training session should start with a warm up and end with a cool down to ensure maximum muscle recovery. Resistance training should be undertaken at a minimum of two sessions per week containing a variety of exercises. Three sets of each exercise should be performed with 8 to 12 repetitions. It is recommended that the individual begins the program starting at 50% of the 1 repetition max with the goal of obtaining  85% of their 1 repetition max through repetitions. In addition to these recommendations the goal of any program should be long term adherence to the program, which will have the greatest benefit overall.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Exercise recommendations
for osteoporosis&quot; Author:Mark R Forwood, Judy A Larsen Retrieved from http:http://anzbms.org.au/resources/policies/osteo_exercise.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is Metabolic Syndrome? ===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_Syndrome ''Metabolic Syndrome''] is a cluster of risk factors, a number of which can occur at the same time. These risk factors include, but are not limited to: 
:* Central Obesity or BMI &gt; 30;
:* Increased Triglycerides (&gt;1.7nM);
:* Increased Fasting Plasma Glucose (&gt;5.6nM);
:* Increased Blood Pressure (&gt;130/85 mmHg); and
:* Increased Body Mass Index (&gt;30).
Following the diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome, treatment may initially involve low intensity exercise therapy as an intervention&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332786/?tool=pmcentrez 1]&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by Diet&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22587821/?tool=pmcentrez 2]&lt;/sup&gt; Pharmacotherapy and potentially Surgery.
=== What about the Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome? ===
All of the risk factors comprising Metabolic Syndrome have existed for a long period of time, however it has only been recently that world organisations have started to create a succinct definition for what constitutes Metabolic Syndrome and develop prevalence data. The prevalence of individual risk factors varies amongst populations and therefore so to does Metabolic Syndrome. Physical activity levels, population age, diet and genetic structure all influence the prevalence of each risk factor and consequently Metabolic Syndrome. Irrespective of all of these underlying influences, the increased prevalence of Metabolic Disease worldwide has and will lead to negative health outcomes on a large personal, social and financial scale.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15158523/?tool=pmcentrez 3]&lt;/sup&gt;
=== What is Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise? ===
For general purposes, High Intensity Exercise can be defined as brief periods of high-intensity exercise intermixed with periods of recovery at a lower intensity, compared to a more conservative approach generally used for exercise prescription that would usually involve Continuos Low-Moderate Intensity Exercise. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22587821/?tool=pmcentrez 4]&lt;/sup&gt; This can be quantified as heart rates measuring &gt;90% of recorded heart rate maximum. 
=== What are the benefits of Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise in relation to Metabolic Syndrome? ===
In a world where time is a rare commodity, Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise provides a time effective way to reap the many benefits of exercise. The reasoning behind using High Intensity Exercise in both healthy and clinical populations, is that the segments of high intensity work promote greater adaptations via increased cellular stress and allow untrained individuals to conduct a higher rate of work than would otherwise be possible during Steady State or Low - Moderate Intensity Exercise. This is predominantly due to the short duration and corresponding recovery periods. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332786/?tool=pmcentrez 4]&lt;/sup&gt; Some research indicates that Short Duration, High Intensity exercise may even be superior to Moderate Intensity Exercise&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15179103//?tool=pmcentrez 5]&lt;/sup&gt;. Some benefits include, but are not limited to:
:* Improved Anthropometrics (&lt;Waist circumference);
:* Decreased Fasting Plasma Glucose;
:* Improved Insulin sensitivity; and
:* Decreased Blood Pressure.

=== Recommendations: How can Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise be used as an Intervention? ===
With appropriate guidance and a structured training plan, High Intensity Exercise can be comprised of a variety training modes both individually and in combination. These include, but are not limited to:
:* Resistance Training;
:* Walking;
:* Running;
:* Swimming; and
:* Cycling.
Once selected, individually or in combination, exercises could be performed, as an example, in a simple format of 4 x 4 Minute intervals at 90% Heart Rate Maximum, followed by periods of 3 Minute recovery at 70% Heart Rate Max&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606913/?tool=pmcentrez 6]&lt;/sup&gt;. This presents an opportunity for an exercise session that is of shorter duration and broader variety, which may in turn create greater exercise compliance.
=== Precautions ===
Although current research has shown it is safe and effective to participate in Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21747296/?tool=pmcentrez 7]&lt;/sup&gt;, the following steps should be considered before participating:
:* Consult your General Practitioner for the most appropriate way to manage Metabolic Syndrome; and
:* Seek guidance from an appropriately qualified practitioner, such as an Exercise Physiologist.
=== Conclusion ===
Whilst it remains controversial which mode of exercise yields the most beneficial adaptations and is the most effective for reducing the impact of Metabolic Syndrome, recent research indicates that Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise reaps many of the same, if not more benefits than Continuous Low-Moderate Exercise.

[[File:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|200px|thumb|left|User in a CAVE. The user's head position is tracked and the graphics on the walls are computed for this tracked position.]]
This tutorial discusses off-axis perspective projection in Unity. It is based on {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. No shader programming is required since only the view matrix and the projection matrix are changed, which is implemented in JavaScript.

The main application of off-axis perspective projection are virtual reality environments such as the CAVE shown in the photo. Usually, the user's head position is tracked and the perspective projection for each display is computed for a camera at the tracked position such that the user experiences the illusion of looking through a window into a three-dimensional world instead of looking at a flat display.

[[File:Picture_plane_projection.png|200px|thumb|right|Off-axis projection is characterized by a camera position S that is not on the symmetry axis of the view plane.]]
=== Off-Axis vs. On-Axis Perspective Projection ===
On-axis projection refers to camera positions that are on the symmetry axis of the view plane, i.e. the axis through the center of the view plane and orthogonal to it. This case is discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

In virtual reality environments, however, the virtual camera often follows the tracked position of the user's head in order to create parallax effects and thus a more compelling illusion of a three-dimensional world. Since the tracked head position is not limited to the symmetry axis of the view plane, on-axis projection is not sufficient for most virtual reality environments.

Off-axis perspective projection addresses this issue by allowing for arbitrary camera positions. While some low-level graphics APIs (e.g. older versions of OpenGL) supported off-axis projection, they had much better support for on-axis projection since this was the more common case. Similarly, many high-level tools (e.g. Unity) support off-axis projection but provide much better support for on-axis projection, i.e. you can specify any on-axis projection with some mouse clicks but you need to write a script to implement off-axis projection.

=== Computing Off-Axis Perspective Projection ===

Off-axis perspective projection requires a different view matrix and a different projection matrix than on-axis perspective projection. For the computation of the on-axis view matrix, a specified view direction is rotated onto the ''z'' axis as described in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. The only difference for an off-axis view matrix is that this “view direction” is computed as the orthogonal direction to the specified view plane, i.e. the surface normal vector of the view plane. 

The off-axis projection matrix has to be changed since the edges of the view plane are no longer symmetric around the intersection point with the (technical) “view direction.”  Thus, the four distances to the edges have to be computed and put into a suitable projection matrix. For details, see the description by Robert Kooima in his publication [http://csc.lsu.edu/~kooima/pdfs/gen-perspective.pdf “Generalized Perspective Projection”]. The next section presents an implementation of this technique in Unity.

=== Camera Script ===
The following script is based on the code in Robert Kooima's publication. There are very few implementation differences. One is that, in Unity, the view plane is more easily specified as a built-in Plane object, which has corners at (±5, 0, ±5) in object coordinates. Furthermore, the original code was written for a right-handed coordinate system while Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system; thus, the result of the cross product has to be multiplied with -1. Another difference is that the rotation of the camera's GameObject and the parameter &lt;code&gt;fieldOfView&lt;/code&gt; are used by Unity for view frustum culling; therefore, the script should set those values to appropriate values. (These values have no meaning for the computation of the matrices.) Unfortunately, this might cause problems if other scripts (namely the script that sets the tracked head position) are also setting the camera rotation. Therefore, this estimation can be deactivated with the variable &lt;code&gt;estimateViewFrustum&lt;/code&gt; (at the risk of incorrect view frustum culling by Unity).

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// This script should be attached to a Camera object 
// in Unity. Once a Plane object is specified as the 
// &quot;projectionScreen&quot;, the script computes a suitable
// view and projection matrix for the camera.

&lt;/source&gt;

To use this script, choose '''Create &gt; Javascript''' in the '''Project''' view, double-click the new script to edit it, and copy &amp; paste the code from above into it. Then attach the script to your main camera (drag it from the '''Project''' view over the camera object in the '''Hierarchy''' view). Furthermore, create a Plane object ('''GameObject &gt; Create Other &gt; Plane''' in the main menu) and place it into the virtual scene to define the view plane. Deactivate the '''Mesh Renderer''' of the Plane in the '''Inspector''' to make it invisible (it is only a placeholder), but make sure that the front face of the plane is always facing the camera. Select the camera object and drag the plane object to '''Projection Screen''' in the '''Inspector'''. The script will be active when the game is started. Add the line
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
&lt;/source&gt;
at the top of the code to make the script also run in the editor.

There are a couple of limitations of this implementation in Unity:
*To keep the script simple, it assumes that the front face of the plane (the face that is visible when backface culling is active) is facing the camera. 
*The camera preview in the Scene view doesn't take the changed projection matrix into account and is therefore no longer useful.
*The built-in skybox system also doesn't take the changed projection matrix into account and is therefore also no longer useful. (See {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Skyboxes}} for an alternative way of implementing skyboxes.) 
*There are probably further parts of Unity that ignore the new projection matrix and that therefore are unusable in combination with this script.

=== Summary ===
In this tutorial, we have looked at:
* uses of off-axis perspective projection and differences to on-axis perspective projection
* the computation of view and projection matrices for off-axis perspective projection
* an implementation of this computation and its limitations in Unity

== A customer approach ==
This work is addressed to everyone who asks himself what will be, in the near future, the information needs for the consumer industry. This paper is thus addressed to people working in information technology, marketing, organization or general management. Their interest will be over the whole book and, particularly, in the chapters regarding the general objective and solutions architecture for the industry and retail environment.

This works derives from various personal experiences out of which I chose the two real cases which are presented in the initial chapters: in both cases the real problem was to shift the company information focus from the support of internal processes to the analysis and evaluation of the market scenario in which the companies were acting.

One of the problems I had to cope while doing this job is to be sure to use a methodology which would help me taking into consideration every part of the problem, not forgetting any aspect. 

The method is one of the aims of the book.

From a presentation point of view, I decided to start from the real cases and then get to the abstraction, not vice versa; it seems to me easier to understand. This is the reason why the case studies are quoted initially; they should help the reader to face the more “formal” discussions with an operational attitude, not as just “principia”.

Generally I think that, after the pure automation phase (accounting, MRP etc.), information technology will need to help industries to approach the complete cycle of customer needs. This will mean taking into consideration processes with a very little syntactic content but very common: informational unstructured scenarios. I think that these processes are the one that will give us some better prediction information models and also improve our operational and control tools.

I am sure that his work has plenty of ingenuities, methodological and language mistakes but, as I found no literature on these topics, I decided to use it as a request for help so that we can make a better service to our general “customer”.

'''The company''': this case history is about a middle sized industry in the market of apparel and fashion.

The total business is fairly split between production of fabric and underwear, especially beach wear.

The company was historically a weaving site and the apparel part was created to fill the period of the year when fabric production was low. 

The company was created by a single person, a fairly typical situation, and grew up on such a one-person organizational schema. As time passed and markets changed, this model showed its limits and the whole company was suffering poor sales. Everybody was feeling that something new was needed but there was no clear model to follow or copy. The company was slowly losing all its assets: market as well as culture, including human expertise in management, control and operations.

The market: as you might have guessed the main part of the customers belong to two different categories:

# Other companies buying fabric
# Retailers buying underwear and beachwear.

We are thus talking about two different classes of customers with two different sales channels (direct sales vs. sales agents) and different habits. Geographically the company was selling mainly in Italy with little or no foreign turnaround.

From the “marketing” point of view the two parts had a completely different approach:

# The “fabric” department had very little “brand awareness” as the product was thought for a technical market  where the customers are specialists
# The “underwear” department had a definite need for “brand recognition” as this is a large part of the final sale.

The existing information system: as it often happens the actual IT was the result of many years overlapping without the possibility of a real radical rethinking. This was due to two major reasons:

Any radical reorganization of the IT system would have meant discussing the real essence of the company both in scopes and in structure

The IT manager did not have the organizational strength and will to pursue such a task, a job which would have meant criticizing actual high class managers.

The whole situation was also worsened by the fact that the new line of business (“the underwear”) started as a result of another company acquisition. 

All of these factors lead to the existence of two different systems, almost non compatible and with double costs in terms of maintenance and development; worse of all the existence of two technical worlds created the idea that two different companies were acting and that no synergies were possible.

Control system was also a problem as the two systems used different coding and taxonomy so a third system had to exist to aggregate the final data.

Economical perspectives: the international market context and production methods were driving the company to a slow decline in spite of local situation like crisis of recoveries. The whole business model had to be redesigned and the IT was a problem for this. 

First of all the company needed to understand what was important and what was not; this information  was not in the IT capabilities as the system was the image of the company situation and it could not merge internal information with external signals also because people working in it was too busy in getting it going on the operational side.

'''The turn point''' of the situation came when a new CEO was appointed. He decided to analyze every process to create a more elastic and homogeneous company structure. This decision put the top manager in a very delicate position: he could have been the successful innovator, the visionary leader or the excuse for a failure. Particularly in one-man company (level 2 of the Greiner model) product and direct processes are so deeply tangled that any structure variation is seen as an “offense” to the history of the enterprise and these changes are not considered as rational necessities for the company health. Service processes, and IT especially, are not felt as “communication needs” as this job was done by the founder as a physical person. Obviously we all know that is one of the deepest reasons why that communication model (the one-man company) cannot raise over a certain dimension and therefore cannot gain certain dimensional efficiencies.  

With the help of an advisor the new CEO has looked into the problem of updating the IT system and his first problem was to decide which kind of approach was to use:

'''The content approach''': this is the most common approach and it start from defining the typical parameters connected to:

* Technology situation: both technical and functional (HW, SW, user requests coverage etc.)
* Consultancy situation: both related to the existence of “best practices” in the field and to the presence of players (consultancy firms) available
* Project content: typically you tend to copy the actual requirement schema because it is what users ask for
* Timing: months to years horizons
* Objective: to a have a more flexible and usable platform; an updated environment.

'''The functional approach''': this approach starts from a different point of view: “we want to improve customer service” where “the customer” is both the internal user but mainly the external sales customer as this last one certifies the company in the market. So, for each process, we it was necessary to define:

* The customer: who is he? (both known and potential)
* The service: what does this mean? product, attention, social needs
* The product: what the expectations of the customer (the standard we want) as a function of reliability, availability, fashion alignment.
* Esteem needs: achievement, attention, recognition
* Social needs: belonging, recognized interaction
* How do we define and how do we measure these needs?
* How do we acquire these informations?

The main purpose of this approach is to define some quantitative parameters for a business model with particular attention to the idea of “customer service”.

This second approach was really appreciated also for its “push” attitude on people who had somehow lost what the market really asked for, even though this analysis requires, as an assumption, that a customer knows what he wants, a “mature” approach, and this, by itself, is a statement to be demonstrated.

The first real step was then to figure out what the customer real needs were, differentiating them from what were historically thought them to be or from what were perceived by the various intermediate acting agents. The basic idea was to compare which information were in the IT system and which one were needed to be really customer compliant as to decide which way to invest in the general company information system.

On the external customers, the real steps which followed began with

* Identify “representative customer” by the sale force
* Check whether these customers were really representative of the whole internal market by defining the selection criteria for a sample
* Make an interview to “random customer”, “statistically sample customer” and “representative customers”
* Collect their needs and cross table the results.

The beginning was a disaster, the general attitude was:

Sales people: customers are an asset of “my” division; it is only me who should talk to them

Marketing people: the product is “right”; it is the customer who does not understand it (!).

The CEO skill was to be able to maintain the right direction and get everybody to understand that the company could only grow if it would face the real changing world, avoiding closures and blind behaviors; a formal check is something which is in the nature of improving processes.

As a result of this phase it turned out that the important parameter to be fixed was “time-to-market”: both the fabric and the underwear department could not compete with far-east productions in terms of prices so, assuming that quality was perceived as “sufficient” (therefore a correct positioning on the market) the request was for small production quantities which were to be available quickly.

From the company point of view, this meant:

# A better information system connection
# A better relation system between customer and vendor
# A product industrial design which could allow a quicker response
# A different industrial relation management for customer who need products with a long lead time
# A better forecasting and projection system.

This whole analysis was then enlarged to non-covered channels like e-commerce and direct retail.

'''The solution approach: obliterate or improve'''. This question has been raised so many times by the times of Hammer and Davenport and we know that it has no general answer but it must be correctly posted in the real context. This pragmatic approach must also keep into consideration that the smaller the company the more important is the role of individual physical persons which are themselves “organizational customers” with their background of Maslow needs.

Inside the company the process started requesting each key employee how he felt about the idea of “customer” whether internal or external. We then reversed the question and asked everyone how he felt as being a “customer”, which kind of expectations he had, whether fulfilled or not. In this way we arrived to define a map of “needs”. We then matched these “needs” with their coverage both declared (by the function) and perceived (by the customer).

The difficulties we found, at this stage, were essentially two:

* The capacity of “customer”  and “supplier” to estimate the importance and the coverage of problems; aggressive users tent to impose small problems as important mainly to show that were important people while passive persons would adapt to uneasy situations for the sake of peace
* The difficulty in accepting the idea that, being the company a whole system, the total result is the combination of all parts running well and not just a sum of parts each running at its own speed.

The fact that external consultants were involved helped people to question themselves as well as gave the company an external evaluation of specific professional capability.

In this analysis period the IT group showed its greatest limits as it was trying to support individual needs without having the chance of harmonizing the whole system. Individual requests were pushing into specific directions so the general feeling was that of a waste of time and money. From the outside we can say that it was just a representation of the company situation but to the inside this was the excuse for the falling efficiency.

'''The final choice''': as we said the CEO found himself in the middle of 

* The outside world and the its dynamics
* The needs of the internal operators and especially of the owner.

The way he chose included:

* Making the situation clear to everybody including the owner
* Understanding the stakeholder needs and make them the strategic goals
* Formally analyze the market needs
* Define the organizational model including the operational role and responsibility of the stakeholder
* Getting all the human resources through a processes of upgrading their attitude to “customer service”
* Define the instruments to control both the “service” and economic indicators of each department.

As far as the IT department the choice was:

# Simplify the existing reporting processes as much as possible so that the actual technical infrastructure would last some time allowing the company to concentrate on other projects
# Invest very much on instruments related to “company critical” issues like
* Style research
* Product design and management
* Technical product definition
* Market analysis
* CRM
# Define a strategy to clear out the dependence of the company from a few IT people who actually could not be changed and get the user to accept some minor cut in service level as a function of a clearer general view on the whole system. This part was to support the company up to the change of the system in a medium time period (2–3 years), mainly through a process of data and process definition.

The company:  this case study is about a small-medium sized apparel company retail division. This company, as it often happens, started on the idea of a specific line of products and later approached the retail channel in a naive way.  The retail story began with the need of liquidating the company surplus in a company outlet; this was not enough so the company approached the outlets circuit. At this point it did happen that the product offer was not balanced to make a good service to the customer so the company had the need to work with the stock channel to get rid of what was left over.

By that time the company thought it has developed a culture of “retail” so it made a decision to approach the wholesale market with mono-brand locations and/or shop-in-shop experience in the department stores.

Almost always such a change implies a large item offer so the initial “product” idea spread over a “total look” vision with its corresponding design and production problems.

The company we are talking about moved from an offer of about 150 samples to about 500 pieces thus multiplying by three the whole paperwork.

The retail division had a target of about 50 sales point, searched by a consultant and interiorly designed by a fashion architect.

The market: the company operated in the casual sportswear mainly on jackets. Geographical distribution was worldwide but mainly rich eastern countries and emerging countries, due to the average price of the product. The “ideal” customer belonged to a fairly rich class, he liked sportswear and he was fairly aggressive. The style actually intended to be aggressive enough to be chosen both by young and older people.

The existing retail IT system was originally chosen to support the initial outlet, so its main features were:

* Low cost
* Little and clear functionalities
* One level architecture (shops and main)
* single cash register in a shop
* Written and maintained by a near located, “friend” software house.

Quite a few problems had been solved on a “quick” solution attitude as volumes were small, no general approach.

The whole situation was worsened by the fact that no user came from a structured culture environment so they tent to solve their problems on an unstructured, personal way.

When the whole phenomena grew bigger two very dangerous behaviors came up:

# The stockholder thought: “if it works for four it will work for five etc.”
# The software house used to say: “I am willing to grow up with you: tell me what you want and I will do it.”

The company was really pushing the instrument over its project limits patching it over and over.

The economical situation: mainly due to the international crisis the company was financially overexposed and the shop system was a real weight to the balance sheet: out of a dozen shops existing only two or three were profitable, another two or three run even and the rest were both losing money and creating end-of-season unsold inventory. These numbers also did not take into account hidden costs that the company had to sustain to help the shop system; costs which are difficult to pin out but that are often consistent.  I am talking about time spent by “structure” people like accounting and/or logistics to help the whole system run.

The turn point came when an outside consultancy firm had to investigate the economical situation on behalf of a new possible stakeholder. The problem was not so much the retail policy as a principle but the way it had been implemented. The company culture was industrial and everybody used to think to “customers” as being wholesaler, which means professionals, and not final customers.

Even if a retail manager and a merchandiser existed, real decisions were made by people coming from “product” oriented people so many the whole process was still very “fashion” and “industry”.

'''The functional approach''': to evaluate correctly the job to be done we went through a dimensional analysis of the needs of the retail department customers including all the aspects of “product”; “subjective” and “social” aspects.

For every view we tried to find as many “objective” data as possible trying to avoid preconceptions. This job was guided by an external consultant, a right choice in my opinion, as we thought that no internal resource could be enough professionally detached to guarantee a correct evaluation.

First thing the company did was to separate needs: wholesale and final customers. This meant almost doubling the job but it allowed checking whether the requests of the retail channel (both wholesaler and property shop) matched with the “real” final customer wishes.

Physically the job has been done through check lists compiled by hired personnel both in the case of retailer and of final customers. Actually final customers were divided into two major categories: customers contacted in shops (already aware of the brand) and people looking at apparel shop windows (apparel keen but not especially on the brand).

Every interview was then graded according to the expectation of satisfaction both as need and as answer to it. The complete results and the exact form of the questions are not public, what we can derive are the changes the company did in its customer policies.

Question sheet results: as far as final customers are concerned we found that:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “fashion” but “middle low class” and definitely not “high class” as the company thought it was. Competitors were quite different from what the company dreamed they were. Some product categories were “identified” while other were considered “useless”
* Product - reliability: quality was recognized but the price was considered too high
* Product – availability: very low, even if much paper presentation was made on the product, the real possibility to find the item in the shops was low. Part of the problem related also to the fact that the company had decided not to offer on the web a certain number of “flagship” items
* Subjective – recognition: sales people “customer service ” attitude was judged barely sufficient
* Subjective – attention: sales people technical support counseling was perceived as not sufficient and this contributed heavily to the perception of a middle low class brand
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual sales people but, on the average, not very high; the brand was definitely not felt like “friendly”
* Social – belongness: a strong feeling of group belonging was felt
* Social - distinction: fulfillment of this need is low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

For retailer the results were:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “average”; the rating was better than the one given by final customers
* Product - reliability: good, little commercial returns and very few items with quality problems
* Product – availability: medium/ low due to poor respect of delivery dates
* Subjective – recognition: quite good, the “retail” customer service was considered very effective
* Subjective – attention: low, customer perceived some sort of company haughtiness
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual agents but, on the average, sufficient
* Social – belongness: no  group feeling existed for retailers
* Social - distinction:  low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

'''Company actions''': based on the results we just quoted, the company decided to

* Product offering returned to about 150-200 pieces for wholesaler and a further set of about 100 pieces distributed only in company stores. These last set of garments were essentially variations on existing garments, to simplify the design phase.  The whole set could then cover the “total-look” scenario for the shops and satisfy brand-keen customers.
* Advertising:  this moved into two directions. The first one tried to re-position the brand in a “high class” section via the relations with testimonials and events. The second activity (fashion and newspapers) was addressed only to the countries where a distribution network existed and not everywhere; only one new foreign market was to be pursued each year.
* Company shops: only economical justified shops stayed open, with the new product offering. As far as new openings were concerned the strategy was to create mixed companies with local operators. These new middle-sized shops were addressed mainly on the sales of the well known products (jackets) and there was a one year starting period to reach balance break even, and no more.
* External wholesalers: the company recognized their importance and created a contact and support groups with the idea of improve their brand loyalty.
* Agents: the company cleared that a new attitude was needed: they were to become not only customer-order collector but also product and “prospect customers” proposers. Quite a few agents did not accept and interrupted their business relation with the company; the major criticism was that there was no longer an independent agent role but that we were talking of company show rooms and methods. This was one of the most difficult parts of the whole project.
* Company shops sale personnel: a long process of selection and education is still taking place to reach the correct standard in human relations and technical knowledge.
* Shop customer service: it became the real guideline of the retail division. Every aspect has been re-analyzed: from shop lay-out to packaging to personnel clothing and attitude. Mock customers are evaluating each site randomly and their results are discussed monthly at company level and twice-a-year with shop managers.
* Main IT system: the upgrade on this was very limited and it concerned almost only the quality of basic data regarding customer needs like delivery dates or quality indexes
* Retail IT system: this system has been changed very heavily. The operational part has been upgraded to a new instrument and also, even more important, new CRM systems have been introduced regarding both classical topics, like fidelity cards, and new topics like known and unknown person recognition. The possibility to follow the path inside the shop and on the front windows gave the opportunity to improve internal paths and increment the time passers-by would stop in front of the shop.

Generally speaking the reengineering is still going on but the results, up to now, are very encouraging  in terms of customer service and of sales point balance break even where all the company shops are now correctly placed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Information systems in the consumer industry}}
Starting from the two real case studies we saw, now we want to analyze, at the highest level, the information needs for the processes of a consumer company. This will help us in defining the whole context of data and procedures to be informationally represented. Once we have done this step we can then match the existing coverage with the actual IT system.

In this work I will specifically speak about clothing industry but the method is valid also for other companies and specially for those where “customer care” is a goal and not only an instrument.

It might happen that the customer is not conscious of his needs but then, I think, we should pursue a “maieutic” process of extraction more than the induction of a new need. In this vision of business, agents and retailers are part of the “extended” enterprise as they transmit the idea of “service”.

The reason why I chose the apparel world is that, among companies which operate on physical goods, most probably is the one which best fits the “service” idea in terms of

* Volume of goods and informations
* Changing ratio for the product
* Low unitary value for the product
* Different ways of approaching the final customers
* Difference between “customer” (retailer) and “consumer” (2 decision levels).

Anyway I tried to be as general as possible and you could think of applying this method even to politics as a “service” industry to people.

 Before getting into the phase of analysis, I would like to consider something we quickly quoted: apparel sales are usually made in shop with the help of an employee. From the point of view of producers the “customer” is the retailer or some people in its organization (e.g. department store) while the “real” market is the end-user.  The employee actually has a very important role in addressing the choice but he is also a fundamental vehicle for the satisfaction of the esteem needs of the “real customer”.

From an information point of view, the employee is a problem as it creates a “human” bias on the sales data (he addresses the sale) and also, sometimes, he forces his opinions into the information system. The same problem exists in the process of selling the garments to the retailers: the agent can be himself a source of information errors.   

 

As my goal is to help defining a model for an information system, to be later translated into technical instruments, I need to define data, states and processes into detail. This is a huge work and I decided to stop at first level; this is not an ERP detail analysis which would be unrealistic. Sometime I go deeper in the analysis when I think that the actual topic has not been fully cleared.

'''Analysis Methodology'''

As analysis practice is not so clear and defined, I tried to use a methodological approach as general as possible using technique of system and process analysis.

Let us define “system” as an ordered set of organized elements all of them aimed at a certain goal. These elements can include physical objects (hardware, software), people, informations, instruments etc.

The representation of a physical system can be made via a dynamic picture (processes) or a static picture (states). A process can be defined as the passage between states (initial and final) of a system; the “state” is the photograph of a system in a steady situation. 

According to the nature of the content, we can divide processes in information-bound (e.g. document handling) and physical object related (service) ones. In the first group the information and physical process coincide. As far as the second case is concerned let us make an example related to the industrial world: we can define the state (space and time location of goods: logistic view) or the changing process (goods transformation: industrial view).

The associated information system, related to the physical one, must define the context, the initial state and the transformation rules (processes).

Here we are interested in defining the abstract model (information model in our case) of the real system (natural of artificial) which we call physical system. The representation has its meaning in the context defined by variables and metrics which relate the variables to physical data. Context is defined by the choice of variables and their physical significance; state by the initial values (inventory etc.) and process by the measurement quantities (inventory movements etc.).

Informations (context meaningful data) are itself object of some form of treatment: we classify information “functions” into retrieval, storage, transmission, transformation and presentation.

Just for the sake of completeness we quote the conceptual problem of “measure” problem in its two faced aspects of the need of a measuring instrument and of the fact that the measuring action could change the measured system.

We need also to remind that we have been talking about “semantic ontologies” (which means that these rules belong to a general schema including variables and metric systems) while we know that in the global information world there are plenty of unstructured semantics with many informations inside but with a high grade of difficulty in using them.

In this work, we are interested in “business processes” which are artificial processes representing functions related to the activity of a business company. These processes, not like natural systems, do not work on deterministic laws where, once you know the initial state and the total input, the total output of the system is pre-determined. We are talking about social systems in different cultural environments and related to unpredictable events so the output, at most, can only be generally forecasted and not galileianly determined. 

In this chapter more than trying to represent the processes in formally correct a usable language (a task for methodologies like UML), I would like to approach the problem of a methodology to be sure that every aspect of an information problem has been taken into consideration; I am looking how to define all the aspects of an industrial general process, a fashion one in our case.

We already saw that to define the information system we need to individuate the values of the variables related both to the state and to the process; in my experience this passes through the analysis of what I call the “information dimensions” where a dimension is an independent set of information data.

From a practical point of view we have to ask ourselves a set of questions about the initial state and about what happens in the system. The questions I asked myself are:

* What: what is the content of the process; which indicators are chosen and measured in the process
* How: how do I collect and treat informations (state), how does the process happen. This dimension includes the problem of the measuring methods, of the change of indicators (e.g. six-sigma method) and of the choice of the representation language for a coherent formalism
* Who: the definition of the actors in the process and their representation in terms of informations
* Where: which are the location of the processes; initial, actual and results places? In a global system these places can be very far away so you have to consider time-shift, different languages (presentation) and culture
* When: the time the process starts (initial state), lives and finishes so that parameters are in the final state (remember that people are components of the system)
* How much: what is the change in the variables; both internal and context variables
* Why: the reason why the process happens: internal laws (initial stability of the system) and external (context need).

Out of all these questions the most peculiar one is certainly “Why” as sometimes it is related to external laws or habits and sometimes it relates to internal reasons of order and efficiency. Again these last considerations show that we are not operating in a “classical” deterministic world.

 The “how much” dimension relates the process to the physical reality (remember we are trying to write some sort of “semantics” of physical processes). We should be able to separate really meaningful variables which actually change during the process assuming that, quite often, the change is only a statistical change and the sample is in the limit of the De Moivre (see example) theorem.

It might happen that some dimension coincides: for example imagine the physical process of an apple falling form a tree. In this case the “what” and the “where” of the process are the same as the process is exactly the fall of the apple; this does not mean that we can confuse

“where” as a geographical context and

“where” as a content of the process.

From the point of view of methodology all the dimensions should be taken into consideration and, in special case, some of them coincide.

As we said, we are talking about systems which are not completely deterministic, like classical physics; space-time homogeneity is to be considered a lucky case and not a general situation. This implies that reversibility of processes is not guaranteed, sometime it is even forbidden; so certain technical instruments (compensation handlers) cannot be given for granted.

''' The company goal: a real problem.'''

We assume that a fashion company goal is to create value via improving the level of the apparel worn in the surrounding world which, by itself, is the target market for the company itself. This gets real through four fundamental processes:

* '''Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs'''
* '''Ability to rationalize and interpreter customer needs'''
* '''Ability to satisfy customer needs'''
* '''Ability to explain its capability in satisfying the needs.'''

The way to solve this major task is the full stream of the industrial project with all its aspects: marketing, sales, production, logistics, and structure.

In the marketing books we can see underlined the meaning of the 4P (product, price, place, promotion) which means getting the right product, at the right price, in the right place at the right moment  and tell this opportunity to the customer.

 From an information point of view, this analysis leaves us with more than one open question, the most important: what does “right” means? How can we measure such a quantity? Someone says that it will be the market response to determine whether or not the choice was “right” but this is an answer  “a posteriori”; what a company needs is a correct, or at least “best guess”, forecast “a priori”.

Customer needs: fundamentals

 Before advancing further I think we should clear out what “customer needs” are.

Psychologist  Abraham Maslow indicated a hierarchy of needs into 5 levels:

Physiological needs (air, water, nourishment, sleep)

Safety (medical insurance, job security, peace)

Social needs (friends, group belonging, give and receive love)

Esteem (self-respect, achievement, recognition, reputation)

Self-actualization (truth, justice, wisdom, meaning)

Once a need is mostly satisfied it no longer motivates and the next higher need takes place.

As far as clothing are concerned 

* The first level is never taken into account
* The second level concerns “utilitarianism” which means the basic role of garments as defense from environment (cold etc.). In the rich society this needs is getting less and less important because of many factors (the heating systems, cars) which modify the relation between human body and environment. This need is still very important into technical clothing (work, sport) where functionality is predominant
* In the third level I would introduce personal feeling (cashmere hand feeling, valentino’s red, leather smell) and the sensation we feel when we fit well
* In the fourth level I think we can fit the social factor of recognition in the act of buying the garment (actual sale moment) or in the belonging to a “group” with its distinctive signs. Some authors tent to underline the first aspect but the actual rise in the internet sales seems to contradict them. Another argument supporting the after-sale group belonging experience is related to the expanding business of counterfeiting which could indicate how much people need to be “brand dependent”
* The fifth point, in my opinion, includes a real shopping experience in which the customer is recognized as an individual and his needs are fulfilled in a mature and respectful way.

Personally I think that the rating of the various needs depend not only on the person himself but also on the context (time, place and mood) which, by itself is not a scientific variable.

  

Customer needs: practice

What we really want to do is zeroing the difference between customer expectations and the perception of the product/service quality of what he has bought; in this case we have satisfied our customer who thinks he has paid the correct price for what he buys.

Referring  to the quality service models via multidimensional hierarchical analysis (Dabholkar) or to gap analysis model (Parasumaran et alt.) and integrating other variables, we must satisfy quality parameters related to:

* Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)
* Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)
* Product: availability where and when it is requested
* Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)
* Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)
* Subjectivity : empathy
* Sociality: group belonging
* Sociality: individual recognition.

As we said before, customer satisfaction is a multi-faced operation and we must never forget that the “customer” is “the important person” and not only a “product” accessory, even for the best products. On the other hand, we do not want to “sell dreams” with no product around as, once the sale euphoria passed, we would have an unsatisfied customer and no customer retention in future time.

As far as the “social” part of the company-customer business relation we keep into consideration the difference between “style” and “fashion” (Espinoza  - MIT Media Lab). “Style” is a principal component in group identity so, maybe in a costly way, it can be copied from someone outside the “group”. To keep it difficult for externals to keep updated with the group dynamics, the code must be continuously changed and this give rise to the “fashion” phenomena. Now we understand how “fashion” is something related to the internal of a group while “style” relates to an outside value for the group culture. When a new “style” reaches a critical mass it gets accepted into social culture and some new break point are looked for.

This topic becomes very important when we talk about information systems (in the wide sense) for the social aspect.

Data importance

From a survey we did in a group of generic customers, we found that the relative importance of the various factors in the buying action is

Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)    6,3

Product: availability where and when it is requested    9,0

Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)    7,0

Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)    7,3

Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)    7,3

Subjectivity : empathy    6,6

Sociality: group belonging    5,9

Sociality: individual recognition.    6,3

It is important to point out that these values are related to a sample of customers in the field of apparel so its value is significant only in this field.

Methodologies for a solution

Actual methods for solving the customer needs are now essentially two:

# Industry: start from customer  requirements and designing the whole industrial process (design, production, logistic) to fulfill the need
# Trade: choosing globally and offering locally what the retailer thinks is the best solution for the customer need.

These approaches, obviously, have some common aspects but also some special features that we shall discuss later.

Let us now analyze the processes which exist in both methodologies.

== Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs ==

In this process, the system is the environment “company – potential customer” where the customer is the owner, more or less conscious, of his needs. The goal of the process is to share this information with the company.

'''Why''' should we try to perceive the need? The answer lies in an agnostic approach on other people needs. In my opinion a company role is not to believe to be the truth depositary but to be the instrument for maybe extracting and solving customers requests.

'''Who''' acts in the process of need perception? Three kind of people act: who has the need (the customer), who collects the need, who transmits the need.   

Feeling the need, the customer is the person who explicitly raises the request (demand driven) or who owns the hidden need who is to be extracted (supply driven).

We can categorize our customers into:

* Well known customers, person we know via a history of relations (fidelity cards or so); among these customers we care particularly about customers who have shown to be statistically significant in terms of representation of the whole customer set
* Unknown or random customers
* Potential customers: among these we could include people belonging to social groups which we consider target for our product, people looking at shop windows or people coming and not buying anything (prospects).

It is obvious that there are different marketing strategies on the three groups: in the first case we want to keep our customer and increase cross-selling or up-selling. In the second situation we want to make our customers loyal, in the third case we want to reduce entry barriers.

Collecting customer needs: I think we can individuate three kinds of people, the first one is someone whose job is to “feel” the market in its wider sense (society, various environments), sometime they are called “cool hunters” or scouts. The second group is formed by the agents who work together with retailers: their view is wider than the single retailer but is narrower and more precise than the one of the scout. The last group is made by sale executives who are actually in contact with specific customers so they have a clear, definite view of a limited request.

Transmitting the information: it would be easy to say that these people are the same that collects it, but it is not true in my experience. This function is often felt as a secondary job so it is delegated to another person, an assistant, done in the spare time or even worse hidden as felt part of the person assets. This attitude implies a great loss of quality in the information transmitted to the company.

'''What''' is a need, what does a customer looks for. Let us start by classifying this dimension on three values:

* Defined needs: specific requests of a definite object  (raincoat, wind jacket) maybe connected in a new environment (e.g. long gloves for snowboarders)
* Semi-structured requests: more general than the former one, yet not very precise. One possible example could be “something like that jacket but the fur around the hood” or “slightly longer or shorter”. This kind of requests, mainly regarding the product, are often expressed in a sign, non-verbal language so they are very difficult to collect and transmit
* Geographical or context needs: particular colors related to a culture or a “glamour” trend better than an understatement. These are examples of customer needs difficult to receive and use but very rich in informations.

In this dimension we have actually analyzed only product needs, we can use the same detail level also for the other levels of needs (internal esteem, social and self-actualization needs). As far as I know there is no research going on this topic which seems very interesting and largely unknown.

'''Where''': about the place the need occurs. There is definitely a relation between the “where” and the class of needs (defined, semi-structured or context); we can recognize:

* Shops: these are the places where there is an explicit interaction with the customer regarding well structured needs. This is a very important information asset
* Shop windows or shop routings: we are talking about potential customers who do not interact explicitly, this is an important patrimony of informations fairly unstructured and difficult to catch and categorize
* Competitors: we are looking at customer needs through what the competitors are offering; it is like looking at the solution and trying to guess the problem. This becomes important when competitors have access at context we cannot get into, for example far away markets
* General geographical distribution: the most general and also the most difficult situation to analyze; as an example you can think about the fact that there is no accepted taxonomy in the fashion business.

As far as the definition of the collection and storage of data, the problem is now shifting form technology problems to the definition of an accepted semantic of data.

'''How'''. To understand how we can perceive customer needs let us consider how these needs show out. We can think of three kinds of externalization:

* Conscious personal needs like an explicit request to a sale operator
* Unconscious personal needs like taking a garment in my hand, looking at it and putting it back
* Social needs like a new “fashion”.

How do we perceive these needs: for each kind we must think of a way to define the elementary information (the state) so we need

* Instruments for sales support, both real and missed
* Instruments for context analysis
* Instruments for competitors analysis
* Instrument for social trend analysis.

Specially talking about the first process, we must be very careful about the easiness of use and the precision of the instrument as the actual operator sometime works in a “normal” situation and sometime in a changed environment like “sales” or “rush times”. Another topic to be considered is related to the significance of the data we are collecting:

* Does an observed customer behave like an ignorant one?
* The data I am getting are biased by the collection process?

At the moment I think these can be considered smaller problems compared to the fact that now we have no data.

 Last but not least there might be a problem on context bias: if we collect data in a luxury shop we shall have a “luxury” view of the problem, same thing for a low income customer environment. This obviously becomes a problem in inter-class analysis while it is not so bad if the company target is parallel to the sample set.

'''When''' do we collect informations and do we use them?

Using the data schema we just defined, we can say that

* Geographical or context needs have a longer time horizon than the specific product; could be one or two years
*  Semi-structured requests are looking mainly a few months in advance, from one season to another; they seems a slightly shorter “time to market” of what is accepted today
* Defined needs are typically immediate in their nature; the ideal would be to answer as soon as the need arise.

Data collection time is definitely related to the nature and horizon of the need but we can post it, more or less, in the sale period and consider a large period dependence on the level of the signal.

 Usage is again related to the class of need and has a strong period dependence the shorter the horizon is.

'''How many signals''' should I collect and how significant must they be?

This is a three sided problem: a problem of method, a problem of measured content and a problem of reference value.

Let us face the method problem: if a customer exclaims “beautiful” in front of a garment the statistical variance of the variable “beauty” is equal to the value of the variable itself so the information is not very reliable. De Moivre’s theorem tells us that the variance of the sample is related to the variance of the population sample as the reciprocal of the square root of the dimension of the sample. Four people saying “beautiful” are twice more reliable than one customer and begin to be statistically significant.

As far as the content of the variables we want to measure, they have to allow you to create a predictive model so they must be objective oriented. Let us make an example: sales turnaround during full price periods and during sales. If we make this analysis in mono-brand shops this becomes an indicator of price correctness between different categories as the offer stays the same and only the price changes so if the trousers percentage sales increases it means that people thought that trousers were too expensive. If the same statistics was run in a multi-brand wholesaler this could be an indicator of “among-brand” competition.

This last example introduce us to the third problem: the value of a measured variable has to be properly fit in its context. A large fur company made a large error some time ago when its sales rose quite lot in one period. This was due mainly to a large competitor’s problem but the signal was interpreted as a growing trend. The fact was that the company did not take into account the fact that the whole fur-coat market was in a steady/declining situation so the raise was to be explained as temporary phenomena.

This dimension can thus be summarized as the capacity of collecting “good” data on significant variables and fit them in the right context.

'''Methods and instruments''': the collection of data is a very difficult process from an operational point of view. 

* Defined needs, as we said these needs exist only for known customers in well defined places. Almost all sales point have instruments for operational processes (inventory movement, invoices, cash accounting), some of these products also have limited CRM functions mainly for after sale care (fidelity cards, recalls). A few of them also have options for supporting sales planning both a budget point of view and from a space/path analysis. As far as I know there is no common solution for requests and lost sales analysis.
* Semi-structured requests related to occasional or unknown customers. In my opinion this is an uncovered field as no specific instrument is available. I read about one experience of customers wearing RFID bracelets to follow their path inside the sale room but it seems to be abandoned (I would not have liked it). Video analysis for figure recognition, apart from privacy problems, is not yet fully available.
* Geographical or context needs: This is a huge and extremely interesting information problem.  It relates to the capacity of analyzing socially open spaces to get signals of “trends” which might appear. As far as I know there is nothing like this existing at the moment. An interesting approach would take into consideration TV and movie pictures: they are biased by the choice of the costumes director but they can be analyzed more and more, till when the algorithm gives acceptable result.

'''

== Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs ==

In this case the context system to be considered is the company and the process goal is to share the data perceived by the marketing department with the design, industrialization, production and logistic departments (industry) or purchase department (retail)  which are the ones who have to propose a company realistic solution.

'''Why''': the existence of this process is related to the need of  converting  general  into company  useful data; we need to translate context events into an internal useful language.

'''Who''': people can be involved in this process both as process and state definition resources. As we shall discuss later (How) methods can be various and this implies that the relative importance of the various actors is quite different. Going back to the various roles, we can point:

* People supplying data are the same collecting them or market search external companies
* People rationalizing customer needs: marketing, product or market managers as this is a very delicate operation which needs high technology competence and market knowledge. Maybe  a better name could be “product/service” analyst.
* People interpreting: in the fashion-product environment they are called “stylists” and they merge context, unstructured, informations with marketing data with a view for a long time horizon.

The relative role of these people is obviously related to the company market positioning: in a luxury company the stylist role is prevalent compared to the same in a large mass market enterprise.

 People using these data are people in the design and supply chain of the company.

'''What'''. As we said customer need is made up of physical objects (the product),subjective aspects (personal esteem) and social requests.

As far as product requests we can divide between “upgrading”, variations on existing themes, and “innovation”  which relate to requests which did not exist or did not have an answer in the former technological context. This last need is the most difficult one to satisfy as it implies the ability to interpreter social sign which could have an impact on future customer desires.

Subjective needs can be divided into “Basic” messages related to the “universal” nature of man, for example ease-of-use, comfort, functionality and “culture related” messages linked to the context the man lives in, for example color choice and matching which are very related to the society the consumer lives in.

Social messages: our aim is to be able to quantify social attention and recognition and social reputation.

At the moment these are very vague parameters.

'''Where'''. As far as the geographical location where the process exists we must keep track of two aspects:

where the process actually takes place, mainly the company main site, and where the process results are used, typically we are talking about the localization of the results. At the moment the most common ways to proceed on the topic include either local analysis and central strategic consolidation or central analysis and local adaption. Unfortunately both solutions tend to have a “time to market” too long and this reduces the competitiveness of the system, we shall get back on this.

'''How'''. As soon as we start talking about analyzing data, so that they become information, the first thought is about data-warehousing, data-mining and, eventually, knowledge management. In reality we are now trying to rationalize and interpret needs and not hidden or explicit correlations. The problem is thus quite bigger and it must include also informations different from what we have in our standard information systems.   From a methodological point of view we can divide analysis into 

* Rational: taxonomies and  abstraction/interpretation methods and instruments. This last group include projections (defined schema and historical data) and previsions (new schemas on historical data)
* Semi-quantitative: analysis of competitors, market semantic analysis
* Irrational or context analysis.

 Usually all methods are taken into consideration as we try to avoid theoretical models which could be not complete or intuition with no relation with reality.

It could be very interesting, at the moment I know of no tries, using heuristic techniques for the solution of interpretation models; I guess model are still not formal enough.

'''''''''When'''.  From the time point of view we must consider two different horizons: the analysis period and the time the results are meaningful. 

As a rule of thumb it is correct that the analysis should be done at the same time of the data collection as it might turn out that some data are incomplete or wrong. 

The validity of the result, for the physical part, is related to the total lead time of the product we are considering while it is not clear how long our analysis is valid when we talk about customer service, it could be interesting analyzing this.

'''How much'''. This dimension is always very difficult to quantify. Let us go back to the Maslow pyramid: how much do I need to satisfy level 2 (product) before moving to level 3 (personal needs) ? We assume that this percentage does not need to be 100% as once the homeostatic equilibrium of the lower level is reached, attention will move to the upper level. The point is: solving the lower at 80% and the upper at 50% (assuming that you succeed in measuring it) is better than 90%-40%?

I think it is a company choice to be made.

Altogether we must estimate the need for

* product in terms of which is our reference market, its dimension, our positioning (the quota) and  how much does our product satisfy the market in terms of price/performance
* personal/social aspects: how important and how much do we satisfy them.

'''Instruments'''. Now that we went through all the dimensions of the process of “Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs” we can have a look at the state of art as far as available instruments. We can group them into

* Analytical methods: based on known and recursive data
** Algorithmical and or statistical: at least statistically precise
** Heuristic: model not totally defined
* Contextual methods: using common sensations, even if not measurable and recursive
** Brainstorming
** Top-down or bottom-up methods.
* Individual methods: related to a particular man-environment situation, very often give non-reproducible results, e.g. Zen ispiration.

 As a personal opinion, even though different methods could be seen as provocative to some people (think of a physicist who should use a zen approach), as long as this process gives usable results is should be accepted anyway. Human beings have being using gravity as a force and apples kept falling long before Newton quantified the mathematical model. Man was using heuristic models to create manufacts.  In field of social science maybe we shall never have a Galilean, recursive model  but this does not mean that we must not get better use of data to be informations.

A possible way to satisfy customer needs is to use specific processes. This means designing, industrializing, planning and producing garments which satisfy the need.

The group of customer we address can be various, it might vary from a single person (make to order) to a homogenoeus set of people on which we make some sort of “average” consideration; if I am talking about well-off teen-agers I need to make different evaluations and  reasonings from a middle-age low income group.

== Ability to satisfy the customer need. ==

The context is the system customer-company; the process goal is to satisfy all the requests starting from the fact that we know them. In this case the information system is a support system, not a core topic.

'''Why'''. We think that satisfying the customer will give immediate return and future perpestive to the company.

'''What'''. The expected results of the process include

* Product: an increase in physical appeal, reliability and availability of the product; a better looking, better quality and easier to find product.
* Subjectivity needs: a better customer care and satisfaction
* Social needs: a better customer group recognition and individual attention, the customer perception of the company as “trusted partner”.

Obviously these results need to be measured on customer expectation.

'''Who'''. People involved in customer satisfaction includes

* Product: design, industrialization, production, logistics
* Personal needs: sales, after sales, CRM executives, retail
* Social needs: promotion, brand management, public relations.

'''How'''. This point is about techniques to be used for customer satisfaction.

In the product area we are concerned about the processes quoted as “direct” in the Porter chain value model. This area is surely the most studied in organizational modeling, we can quote various methodologies from BPR to Kaizen. It is surely not the goal of this work  to get into this problem, better authors then me have worked on this and you can refer to them. 

Personel needs: the studies concerning this area, in my opinion, are not as structured as in the former area.  As far as I know individual aspects of this field have been evaluated but in a stand-alone context, not in a complete customer relation view. The topics we are talking about concern

Customer centrality and adaption to the market

Product availability impact on sales

Sale channel competence and friendliness

After sales service impact

Customer relation management

Direct approach importance: the shop relation

Customer social needs are, in my knowledge, not the object of quantitative studies. This might depend on the fact that data collection is very difficult, so we are still at the level of hypothesis and specific experience collection. We are talking about:

“group” creation and belonging: brand nature and the role of promotion

brand management  and group life-cycle

public relations and their results

“personal” service.

'''Where''' does the process take place: I think we can define the place where the customer is the location where the process starts. Obviously the customer can be anywhere in the world so we must take this into account. The rest of the process may then take place 

Product: in the stylist studio, in the technical, industrial, loistic and retail areas depending on the specific subprocess

Subjectivity needs: sales, customer service and retail areas

Social needs: anywhere as customers can be everywhere.

All these areas must be informationally connectable.

'''When'''. As for the geographical aspects also for the time-related variables the sinchronicity is very important; if you are late in a subprocess there is little chance that you will be able to recover afterwards. This is the deep meaning when “time to market” has been chosen as the critical variable in the next future, speeding up every single phase might give you the elasticity to cope with unforecasted events which might have disastreous effects.

The real problem, in my opinion, is to balance the time associated with each subprocess.

Product: the total lead time, from the idea to the availability, in the fashion wholesale world, lasts about 8–9 months; this period is actually deeply questioned by e-commerce and its related attitude.

Subjectivity: we can think of

Pre-sales (contacts, reciprocal knowledge)

Sales

After sales (recal and custom loyalty).

These process mainly happen on a few months horizon, a slightly longer period than the product cycle.

Social needs. The process of creating a “group” is fairly quick, the real problem is keeping the “group” alive through many years. In this process the “customer attention and recognition” can only start once you have created the “group” so it takes even longer.

'''How Much'''. The metric we use is about 

Product: Aestethic, quality, availability, cost and accepted price 

Subjectivity needs: service, reassurance, empathy

Social needs: how much does the “group” means, how much am I recognized inside the “group”.

As far as the “product” indeces there are quantitative data available related to quality (Aql methodology, number of returns), availability (question sheets and lost sales) and price positioning (sales to full price ratio). As far as I know there are no indeces related to aestetichs, maybe only the number of collection presented  items which never got produced.

Speacking about “service indeces” we have to divid “service quality” and “satisfaction index” (Oliver 1997).  The first is related to external indeces and standard measuring techniques (SERVQUAL, SERVPERF) while the second is related to customer perception. The fact that customer gets in the analysis of the index, introduces two further variables related to time (quality has a fairly long horizon, perception short) and space (consumers in different countries and context have different perception of “satisfaction”).

As far as I know there are no quantitative analysis related to “group belonging” or “group recognition”.

'''Instruments'''

The most well known instruments existing today surely cover the areas of product definition  (PDM) and production controlling (ERP); there are good instruments in forecasting, CRM and sales support.

Getting into details and assuming these are my personal opinions:

Product definition: there are good products helping the product definition (style, PLM, model marking, quality control) and they support time-phased georaphy problems via distributed workflows

* Production processes: definitely the best studied and supported area; you can find instruments (ERPs) very well done both on the theoretical foundaments and technical aspects. The only doubts are about their operational easiness and friendliness.
* Distribution instruments: not at the same level as the ERP but on the right way to be there.

Subjectivity needs support instruments:

* Customer relation: some good CRM package is available but it is still a long way to go to be really complete
* After sale support: it is considered the sales minor process so it has not been developed so much
* Retail. Very good in the operational aspects, not so much for the remaining subprocesses.

Customer social needs: available instruments are essentially question papers statistically analysed; there is no automatic data collection.

Talking about information systems I would like to return to a concept which I think very important. As customers are distributed all over the world, particular care must be taken at every level of integration, not just the technical one (Miotto etc.) if we want to avoid dangereous misunderstandings. Information integration is usually underestimated even though it is well known (Davenport) the importance that information technology had in process disintermediation.

  

== Ability to communicate the capacity of satisfying the need ==

The system is the customer-company environment; the process goal is the fact that the customer ( “group of customers”  to be addressed by my “solution”) is aware that a solution to his needs exists.

'''Why'''. We want the customer to be really aware of the existence of a solution of its limits because real customer service is respectful of customer identity and does not mislead facts.

'''What''' do I communicate, what is the content of the process.

* The knowledge of product content: aesthetics, reliability, availability and price/performance
* The fact that it is really that “product” that satisfies his need (whether primitive or induced)
* The context knowledge about expectation satisfaction, something like saying “come with us and you will be all right”
* The “group” belonging and brand identification
* The “group” recognition.

Regarding this last point we must be very careful about privacy issues, to know each person individually means knowing a lot of informations about him and this might not be compliant with local laws and/or create relation problems with the customer as he feels controlled and classified.

'''Who '''is involved in the process. The customer is the “receiving” (destination, output) part of the process and the company is the active (input) part. Obviously when we talk about customer we must keep in mind all the categories we have been talking about (known, unknown, potential) and calibrate methods and politics for each group.

'''Where''' does the process take place. As we noted companies and customers can be anywhere so the process must be geographically distributed. As far as places where the process takes place we can recognize:

Product: media and PR (testimonials etc.)

Subjectivity: direct sales channel (retail), indirect sales channel (wholesaler), other various channels including word of mouth 

Social: media, retail and PRs.

'''How '''we communicate the information.

Product: direct advertising (I show the product and associate it at human sense), indirect advertising (for example technical people explain characteristics, I get attracted by the person and through him I get to the product); comparative advertising.

Subjectivity: service advertising ( we show our customer service level), the level of professionalism and availability of our sales executive, the product context (packaging, advertising campaign), the service context (POP material, shop furniture and look).

Social promotion: social involvement (e.g. Toscani’s photos per Benetton), fashion shows, licensing, media, internet community, sales point formats, sponsoring; everything which helps creating a “group”. For “group recognition” we must think in terms of personal service.

'''When'''. The time factor in communication is quite different for each need:

Product: the timing is related to the availability (shop, internet or other); it is useless and wrong to communicate a capacity which does exist in reality so it is very important to synchronize ability to communicate and satisfaction capacity

Subjectivity main issue is “trust” which is a long asset to create and a quick one to be destroyed; its time scale is even longer than fashion and style as it might get through different stages of the company; usually it is years long

Social issues, in my opinion, are linked to the idea of “styles”; they are linked to “cultural break” and easiness of information exchange has deeply changed the time scale which I would indicate in a two-three years  period.

'''How much''' we need to communicate means defining the quantity of actions related to each former dimension. In the next chapter we shall propose a view where this dimension is actually related to the evaluation of the cost/return I have in each combination of variables. We know that evaluating the cost is feasible, not easy but usually can be done, while evaluating the return is very hard and it is usually done through side indicators like sale increase. I think there is a lot of work to be done in evaluating measurable parameters.

'''Instruments''': we partially quoted them in the “how” paragraph, we are talking about publicity and PRs. As far as I know there are no instruments, now, able to quantify, as an example, the return of the investment of a fashion show in terms of social impact on the knowledge of a “brand”.

 

== Industry: the architecture of the solution ==

To organize what we have been saying up to now, we have to create a schema including, for each process, every possible combination of the information dimensions we have been considering. Some of these combinations might be nonexistent like “sure needs of potential customers”. 

As an example of the operational method we can have tables like this one:

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Need data collection&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Analysis&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Satisfaction&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Communication&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;Process&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Product'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Subjectivity'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Sociality'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|}
Imagine the first process of need data collection,  here we can ask ourselves which are the needs 

Of a well known customer

Collected by a sale executive who transmit them

Semi-structured needs

Collected in a shop

With a very clear question

At the beginning of a sale campaign

Which means that we are considering one of all possible combinations of parameters.

Later in the book we shall get check how many are the meaningful combinations (Appendix A).

 In this way we are segmenting the total information problem in “cells” each of which has its own individual analysis of states and processes parameters. 

In this method we are not really taking into consideration the “when” and “why” dimension. The “when” variable is related to the variation of the schema in time: an open issue. The “why” parameter, at the top level, is human related and, in my opinion, has the basic meaning of the actual nature of economical enterprise, but this is also an open issue.

This schema reminds us of the phase-space in statistical mechanics where the cell weight is not even but it is related to the weight the company gives to it in its strategy. As in statistical mechanics the content of the cell is a function of both the initial state and the state variation rule (the process), assuming a first order non explicit time dependence. 

As far as the cost of cell fulfillment we can imagine a curve like this:

Where the cost to satisfy 100% is very high. The growth coefficient depends on the nature of the cell and it should be the result of specific analysis which locate the cell in the total analysis space.

When we talk about the value and the cost of an analysis cell we must not forget the reliability of the data we are using in terms of data collection, methods and people involved. This makes things very difficult when you think of a global solution so most companies, in my opinion have been using two side methods:

* What do other people do ( market driven policies)
* What is it going to happen if  I don’t do this (scare of “not doing”).

The method I propose, not forgetting the associated difficulties, is to break down the problem into specific cells and define local strategies in a wider architecture.

I really think that a complete semantic ontology of all cells, including time and space dependence, is a non realistic result so I propose a local approach using also heuristic techniques.

'''The company strategic plan then becomes'''

* '''Assigning a value to each cell of the “customer needs” phase space'''
* '''Trying to associate a cost to the fulfillment of that cell'''
* '''Maximize the phase space covered with the constraint of the company total resources and define the attitude regarding the cells which are not considered for this moment.'''

From an information system point of view, in practice we need to quantify, for each cell,

The weight it has, related to company strategy

The value of information relative to the cell based on a definite metric system

The cost of getting that information.

The total combination gives the information scenario for the company. 

The time factor shows its importance both in fact that the context keeps changing and also in the fact that no company starts from scratch; usually there is an  information patrimony specially in the areas of product needs satisfaction (sales and production). The critical strategy factor now becomes the ability to choose the best solution for choosing the variation of customer phase space as to reach the best overall coverage.

From a practical point of view we start from the highest level four processes, get down to the individual cells and determine the actual company value, the cost of maintenance  and the cost of upgrading.

''It could be interesting to compare the structure of this analysis with the deployment of software projects. The phases of needs collection and rationalization is very well known in the enterprise software production while it is very little formalized in manufacturing.  On the other end the phase of capability communication is much more developed in the industry context.''

We define “retail” as the set of processes which satisfy the availability need in a customer related space-time context. The difference between this set and the previous one is 

# The subject of the process, the retailer, does not satisfy the need starting from designing and projecting the answer from scratch but he tries to solve the problem choosing the  solution, among those on the market, which he thinks will better fit customer requests (sales methodology)
# The relation between retailer and final customer is much more “direct” than in the industrial case so many “non product” aspects are more important.

We can see the retail process from three different point of view:

# Final customer: form this point of view “retail” is simply the availability  in a “local” form; needs and data collection are the same as for the industrial environment
# Retailer: problems concern both to satisfy customers (purchasing and selling) and to relate to the context
#  Context: this relates to how “retail processes” exist in the society both as time phased phenomena (geography = shops, shopping centers; communication etc.) and structure (fiscal and legal compliances)

From the customer point of view “retail” is a service process centered around the actual sale moment but we must remember that it really consists of before sale, actual sale and after sale (preparation, actuation and conclusion).

'''Process Analysis: the customer point of view'''

We know that, generally speaking, customer needs are:

Product        Aesthetics, reliability, availability

Subjectivity    Problem solving, reassurance, empathy

Sociality    group belonging, individual recognition

And that, for each need, direct processes imply:

* Data collection for all the data levels and views
* Analysis and method rationalization to be more efficient and precise
* Satisfaction given by the fulfillment of the need of the real product or of feeling
* Communication which means the ability to communicate the possibility of satisfaction.

The actual need coverage is through the balancing of these factors.

 From the market point of view, the weight of each parameters corresponds to the positioning of the company in the market share.

In the following table we can see how a group of users has quantified their expectations as a function of the sales channel

== Process analysis: the retailer point of view ==

 From the point of view of a retailer, the definite question is:

“why does a customer comes to me and how can I satisfy him ‘”

Which means “which are the customer needs and why does he feel that I can satisfy them ?”.

In the world of retail the contact is not with a “customer” but with a “specific customer”, this means that subjective and social needs are very much stressed compared to anonymous relations. It happens that shops may live on “local” emotional realities (mono or multibrand wholesalers), some other times they have a more “diffuse” approach (department stores, large distribution). 

The birth of a “sales project”, to satisfy a particular customer need at any level of Maslow scale, then is the result of a sales enterprise which evaluates the market opportunities in terms of the lack of a product in a certain area/time, the availability of structures (shops), a new sales method or the existence of an unexploited sociality.

We start from our daily experience to group elementary processes into categories; this will help us in the functional analysis of the retail system.  Processes are sets of actions which satisfy needs whether these needs concern customers, retailers or the context. We assume that, if a process exists, it must have some meaning otherwise it would not exist any longer. Not every possible process exists or, sometime, we are not aware that it exists.

Our methodology starts from listing the processes and then looking for their value on customer needs; we must be very careful to distinguish between “real” value and “customer perceived” value; customer are only interested, and ready to pay for,  in the second ones while there could be processes (e.g. finance control)   which have no value for the final customer but are very important for the retailer. We shall be using the “perceived value” parameter.

To be completely correct from a methodological point of view we should define each process to the very detail, in fact we adapt to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of a process, this means that the value of a process is a function of 

* The relative importance of the customer need (what I satisfy)
* The perceived value of the solution: the expectation (how much I satisfy it).

In the following tables:

Processes are grouped by areas

Coding is such that

Effect on the process: H = high, M = medium, L = low, blank = not applicable

Grouping level: C = customer, G = group, T = context

Area: P = product, S = subjectivity, C = sociality, O = organization, F = fiscal

== Customer need – process existence relation ==

Let us look at the processes we just quoted (remind that needs belong only to the final customer); to fulfill them we need to operate on three different levels (not to be confused with operating entities):

* Single customer
* Customer group : customers of one specific sale point which means how the local retailer organizes the service
* Context: general aspects of service which means how is the general service defined, how to handle general topics ranging from product presentation to fiscal procedures.

The “retail” system does not consists only of processes related to customer relation but it has to cope with many levels of activities; this is the meaning of the “group” attribute in the former table.

Retail support systems: the information processes.

We speak explicitly of “support” and not of software because,  as you can saw from the process listed, the content is not a pure “data” parameters but if often connects to physical or psychological aspects.

We also saw that final customer  and retailer needs somehow differ both in content and in relative weight. 

From an industry point of view the retailer is “the customer” and this is why we need to understand which are the needs he needs to satisfy and he is willing to pay if satisfied.

We can think of retailer needs general schema as:

What we derive from this table is that “single”, “final” customer needs have been largely disappointed in the industrial attitude; companies tend to focalize on “customer groups” as their ability to solve needs is essentially related to product/social  and not to subjectivity capabilities.

This aspect of the end customer need is mainly covered by the “retail” structure.

To be methodologically correct we should now take into consideration all the 32 cells; out of these only 6 (“customer group”, data collection and analysis) have already been taken into consideration in the industrial analysis. In the following pages we shall group some cells to avoid being too long even though we realize that we make a methodological approximation.

'''''''''Customer processes'''

Personal needs are, by definition, very “personal” so they need a very “local” application of general principles stated by the company. The information content is actually very little formalized: we are moving in a very unexplored field.

'''''Product: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are talking about the behavior of a specific customer in a specific sale situation: a very elementary context.

* What: we are looking at the relation between the customer and the garment he is evaluating;
* How: which are the parameters to decide “will the garment fit the customer expectations ?”  or even better: “will the garments satisfy the customer need?”
* Who: the actors involved in the process = the customer and the retailer
* Where does the process take place?  typically a real shop but it could be a virtual one
* When does the concurrence of product/customer occurs ? presence of both customer and product
* How much is the customer need satisfied: this is perhaps the most difficult parameters to measure directly
* Why: this the company strategy.

Assuming that we want to satisfy customer need, I think that the only information instrument which can be used is the sales executive capacity to support requests on product (fashion, quality)  and customer (decision process). Time length and variability of relation, in my opinion, make impossible for a formal information system to be really useful.

Measuring system can only be indirect through a total evaluation of the sale executive.  

'''''Product: communication'''''

The aim of this process is to make the specific customer understand that it is possible to help him in choosing the right product. Assuming that we think that the correct local instruments are sales executive, we want the customer to trust sales executive in their knowledge of product and can help him in determining the product coverage of his needs.

* What: sale executive product competence
* How: must be explicit and customer must recognize it
* Who: the information instrument is the sale executive or, at most, the store manager
* Where: in the sale area, this means physical availability of the vendor
* When: during real and prospect sales
* How much: as far as I know there is actually no formal system of measuring this process, maybe through customer interview
* Why: because it satisfies the customer.

As far as information supports, we must give the actual instrument (the sale executive) the knowledge he needs both on the product he is selling and on competitors so that he can help the customer to judge correctly the answer to his needs.

'''''Subjectivity: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are  talking about elementary processes which concern ability to answer, personal assurance and empathy to a particular customer.

* What: as we are discussing of very individual, peculiar data. I think that the signals and the collection method are very difficult to categorize, we could try to classify the results. From a practical point of view we should define the results we want and leave to the sale executive the method to collect the data regarding customer individual feeling etc.
* How:  we could start from classifying (based on our experience) customer approach and check the results of possible general support standards we offer
* Who: people involved are sales executive and store managers (control level)
* Where: every possible customer relation, mainly in sales area
* When: before, during and after the sale
* How much: a possible measure of unit could be store manager evaluation
* Why: because customer must be at ease from a human relation point of view.

Information support: The sale executive must be empathetic with the specific customer so he must fit his way of acting to the actual situation. Information content must then relate to the sociological world of sales and, eventually, to the social and fashion trends.

'''''Subjectivity: communication'''''

* What: we want to communicate that a customer feels at ease in a particular context. It is a very personal phenomena and it is related mainly to the sale executive empathy, to the sale place format and to the brand image.
* How: the most important means I know of are word-of-mouth messaging and architecture design
* Who: mainly the sale executive, also every other company employee
* Where: mainly the shop but also the general social context
* When: it is important to note that both actual sales but also prospect and possible sales are extremely important for this topic
* How much: I think that only customer interviews can be a measuring instrument
* Why: to get returning customers.

This topic is fairly delicate because customer expectations can be very different from company policy and very often we saw a large gap between the two approaches.

'''''Sociality: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

* What: the content of this point is about the customer feeling himself recognized and accepted
* How:  the whole process starts from customer receiving and recognition which must be precise. In the case of recognition this can be done through formal instruments (fidelity cards) or informal ones (the sales executive memory). In any case there must be standard procedures for each case.
* Who: this is mainly a sales executive job
* Where:  Typically the sales area; it is an interesting topic to understand what this means in a distributed location (internet)
* When: always, during real or prospect sales
* How much: a possible way of measuring this data could be the number of visit a customer does whether they became a real sale or not
* Why: to create a nicer environment for our customers.

From an information system point of view the first problem is related to customer recognition. Sometimes we can find some sort of “fake” personal recognition (e.g. intimate friendship) which annoys the customer, the real cases I can think of are either related to the high luxury environment, where quite a few customers are well known from social news, or small local retail with a consolidated personal knowledge of the customers. In other contexts we must rely on some personal interactions supported by CRM systems not to loose company knowledge.

'''''Sociality: communication'''''

* What: we are talking about the fact that a customer knows he will be recognized and helped
* How: on this topic we can think of formal communication systems like advertising but my opinion is that the best way is word-of-mouth and group diffusion
* Who: people involved are mainly sales executives and store managers
* Where: the sales place and the logical surroundings
* When: during the whole relation with the customer (pre, actual and after sale)
* How much: a possible indicator could be the number of contacts; both ways and any possible content
* Why: because it helps satisfying the customer.

The information object includes the content (“welcome”),  the form (direct or indirect message) and the destination (actual or prospect customers).

 

== Group processes ==

Customer group needs are those industry relates to. As far as data collection and analysis processes, we can refer to the first part of the book as we are talking about collecting and categorize common customer needs; retail is a different way of solving them.

'''Product – satisfaction.'''

* What: the topic is about product availability  in the whole time cycle including after sales. We should divide the process in purchasing, stocking, shelf availability and after sales. Problems concern offer analysis, purchasing operational, sales space limitation as we assume that bulk storage is not a retail problem; the whole system is the retail industrial chain.
* How: operations through subprocesses of purchasing, exhibition, sales and after sales service.
* Who: people involved includes merchandiser, buyers, sales executive and customer service.
* Where: any site of the company
* When: we can estimate a few months period
* How much: the whole process is so large that I think the only summary indicators we can use is the economical turnaround of the enterprise unit (shop etc.); subprocesses can be individually measured.
* Why: this is seen as the real nature of the retail structure, could not be the only one.

Customer satisfaction is “the process” of a retail system as it has to conjugate market availability and specific customer request. From an information point of view it asks for a huge amount of informations (see appendix B).

'''Product – communication'''

What: we are talking about the process which makes the customer understand that, in that place and at the right moment, he will find the answer to his product needs (group level). We thus deal with an information content.

How: we can use formal systems (commercials, press, window presentation) or informal (word-of-mouth) in large social contexts and personal systems (human relations) in limited environments.

Who: usually we cope with professionals in large scales and sales executive in small environment.

Where: Social contexts mean the whole society, up to world scale, and especially in aggregation area while small environment means essentially shops.

When: product satisfaction is not a one shot process, it needs to be created before and fed also after sale, this means that communication has to be time calibrated.

How much: without any communication product access is essentially stochastic so we can have  a first guess relating amount of communication to sales increase.

Why: because it might be that the customer doesn’t know that we can solve his need.

This whole topic should  be analyzed by itself.

'''Subjectivity  - satisfaction'''

* What: in this group we can identify a few topics. We can identify the role of the sales executive (technical expertise, personal attitude, follow up), customer-context relations (shop image, goods location and availability), customer-company relation (commercial, shop windows). They are all the result of how the company has imagined its relation with the customer.
* How: customer satisfaction can thus be a result of how we support
** Sale executive competence both on product and relation
** Context design and product merchandising
** Space positioning, visual merchandising and commercial.
* Who: persons involved include sales executive and sales structure managers to project the sale process
* Where: both in the shop and in the company studios
* When: a real sale experience does not last a moment, we must create a long lasting customer relation
* How much: I think one of the parameters we should consider is customer retention and find a way to measure it (e.g. fidelity cards)
* Why: we want to satisfy every aspect of our customers.

Informations related to this process are various and need a separate study.

'''Subjectivity – communication'''

What: this topic is about how we can communicate our ability in satisfying customer subjectivity

* How:
** sales executive: after the specific training, we must communicate our employees ability in a formal way to the market (group of customers)
** customer – context: after the design of a comfortable shop environment we must be very strict in assuring that the standard is kept
** customer-company: like before we must underline our ability in individual attention.
* Who:  people involved include sales executive and communicators.
* Where: we must act any place a prospect can be but especially near shops, as to use take advantage of existing structures.
* When: we are not talking of a specific product so there is no definite time zone, it is a continuous job with peaks when no specific product is to be advertised
* How much: I think we could use the number of visiting people in our shops as an indicator
* Why: to cover any aspect of subjectivity need.

The information request set is too large to be analyzed here, further studies are needed.

''' Sociality – satisfaction'''

This process is concerned with smaller groups of customers than those addressed by industry, retail is more “locally” concerned either from a geographical (customer in a certain area) or from a social (customer of a certain type) point of view.

* What: the aim is to create a sense of belonging so that the customer refers to the shop, also maybe not for purchasing
* How: the attachment may be induced either directly (direct marketing) or indirectly (social signs)
* Who: it is usually a PR person working on these topics
* Where: the place is related to the sale method (place or market type)
* When: the time base is fairly long as it implies personal involvement
* How much: a possible parameter to measure such a process could be the number of visit, whether for purchase or not, to the company locations
* Why: it is not so easy to create the “social” concept of the retailer, especially for multi-brand retailers who do not share a company support.

Let get into more details for this area. Our analysis could take into consideration:

Customer reasoning:

What qualifies myself from the context?

How much does belonging to that group cost ?   

Which are the group identities and testimonials?

How can I avoid being considered “standard” and yet belong to the group?

Retailer reasoning

How much does it cost to create the “group”?

How much does it cost to maintain the “group identity”?

How much do I get in terms of new customers or upsales form the “group”?

Generally which is the “group” trade off?

I think we can look at two possible ways of approaching the problem:

Internal: a “group” needs to have times and places it can exists (like happy hours in bars etc.) and archetypes it can recognize, testimonials defining the “group characters”

External: a “group” needs symbols like shopping bags or reserved events.

From an information point of view we can measure

Customer retention both in number and quantity

New customers entries

PR costs.

These data are very difficult to obtain as they are much perturbed by product data, at the moment I do not know of reliable analysis on this topic.

'''Sociality – communication'''

While industry communication is essentially based on product, retail communication underline the idea of service, of problem solving. This idea implies that it is more of an institutional then technical communication.

* What: I want to tell people that my “group” is a “happy community” and you can join it.
* How: the mean is related to the market I am heading, no general rule.
* Who: the person who acts is mainly a PR, the customer receives.
* Where: the main targets are customers and prospects so it has to be evaluated where to spend the money; internet is a world situation
* When: if you act just once it is dangerous: the customer asks himself why of these expenses; the “group” communication has be lasting in time as it connect people and it has to create trustworthiness
* How much: let us divide customers and prospects. Customer are to be steadily reminded, the parameter we could measure is customer retention. Prospects are to be invited, we could neasure new entries as a function of expenses.

The informations we need to control are various and often not explicit : imagine we talk of teen-agers buying clothes. Clothes are not just a way of dressing,  it is also a request for meeting similar. This means that a shop is a meeting point and it has to fulfill this need so that the teen-ager likes to stay in the shopping area. Places where you can only buy, in my opinion, have little chance against the web-offer, on the other hand satisfaction places are more expensive than normal shops.

From an information point of view the problem is thus to quantify the ratio between the capacity of satisfying customer social need and economical balance.

  

== Context processes ==

Context processes group all those operations which have no direct relation with the customer so these processes create no customer perceived value but are necessary for enterprise functioning.

A rough classification could divide them into “fiscal” processes (related to external existing rules and laws) and “organizational” (related to process “best practices” in the business area).

Context process are the one which are best known from an informational point of view as they derive either from formal rules (fiscal) or from repetitive experience (organizational); they are also the best information system supported processes. It is not the aim of this paper to describe more deeply this set of processes; I only would like to point out that, as they create no customer value, they must be considered a pure cost driver and the information system goal should be to satisfy the enterprise need reducing these costs. Typically this goal is achieved using methodologies as standard as possible introduced in the company via education and/or consultancy.

== Retail: the solution architecture ==

As we discussed in the industry part of this paper, in retail also we can create a schema for the set of processes related to the company information strategy. The matrix needs-functions is the retail phase space where each cell has its own cost and value; the complete figure is the company positioning strategy.

Some of these cells need to analyzed at a more specific level (e.g. group-product  satisfaction) ì; we should then sum the subprocesses cost to derive the total cell cost while the value is available only at an upper level.

We can think at the “true value” of the need as the product of the need importance multiplied by the channel expectation for the market we are operating, we find a result like the following table:

|}

Based on this schema,  a retailer, as long has he decided which one is his operating channel, can find the relative value of customer need, his problem is now to decide “how much do I want to invest in satisfying this request”.

As we saw, each of these cell is made of many elementary processes with its own contribution to the final cost; this allows us to derive total cost as the sum of the whole solution.

The information technology goal is both to detail the information content and the analysis of a single subprocesses and to reduce the cost of each of the processes  itself using technology in the right way (where possible).

It is obvious that we start from processes which have the highest customer value so that they have  a quicker return.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Information systems in the consumer industry}}
The aim of this work is look for a schema in the structure of information  processing in a consumer industry. Personally I think we can recognize four types of consumer industry:

Physical goods with industrial origin (apparel, shoes, cars)

Physical goods for personal satisfaction (perfumes)

Services (non material goods) with industrial origin (security)

Services for personal satisfaction (films, bodycare).

Foe each type of industry organizational best practices, KPIs and data collection instruments have been defined but I believe that, up to now, information systems have developed only a local coverage related  to immediate needs or to the existence of a single cell information model. 

Looking at the whole information context it turns out that quite a few cell have information characteristics (timing, number of data, algorithms) that make a complete formal model unfeasible to exist. It turns out more useful to adopt a simplifying  approach and reengineer the process.

Sometimes the general approach is not possible also because it might happen that you are still defining the  elementary process. In particular there are many cells not covered by information models and instruments; most of these situation occurs from historical priorities or from lack of technical instruments.

In my opinion we could derive that

I think that, actually, the whole part related to customer subjectivity and sociality is left to the retailer experience and intuition. This attitude implies that satisfaction indexes are bound to be very inaccurate and inefficient. 

Obviously the relative weight of the various cells is related to the context we are working and, up to now, the “product” cells have been the most important.

In a globalized world were access to product will be eased by technical instruments, other factors will become more and more important so we shall get to analyze them.

We also need to stress that subjectivity and sociality assume a fairly different meaning in the internet world and this aspect is completely unknown at the moment.

Phase space for processes

As an example let us try to define the phase space cell for some general and industrial processes, not considering meaningless cell and taking into consideration the initial state of the processes.

'''Processes – customer group level''': here we can have more “general” (e.g. sale market analysis, purchasing) and more “specific”  topics (e.g. shop emotional paths definition); this might change the level of standardization we can find. Let us consider a fundamental retail need:

Customer group level: product-satisfaction.

In this part we consider the processes regarding availability of the product for the whole time period, including after sale. We can spot the following subprocesses:

* Market offer analysis
* Purchasing
* Stock management
* Sales area availability
* After sale behavior.

Assuming that request analysis (what does the customer group wants) has already been done, we want to use those informations.

'''Market offer analysis'''

In this process we match what the market offers with what our customers want. This process mainly takes place in two different ways:

Catalogue analysis

Physical analysis

''Catalogue analysis''

* What: we want to find, in the market we have access (first constraint), the product which best gets near to our objective in terms of
** Nature (clothing type and category)
** Technological properties (composition etc.)
** Aesthetical and fashion parameters
** Price range
** Supplier characteristics (reliability etc.)
* How: this process used to be, and partially still is, fulfilled via information channels like technical papers or physical agents
* When: the search is made essentially when a new collection is introduced so there is little time for changing and this creates markets rigidities
* Where: a multibrand retailer has limited possibilities to make real geographical analysis, we are talking of a fairly strict constraint on this point
* Who: the real actor is the buyer, in small entities this corresponds very often to the seller
* How much: with the actual information systems this process is fairly slow, we might think of using, as a measuring parameters, the number of suppliers taken into consideration
* Why: we want to increase the knowledge of the market offer

This is a process in which there are very large possibilities of increasing the information quality, maybe standardizing the offer methodology; the problem seems to be related to multibrand confusion.

Physical analysis

* What: in this process the retailer checks the correspondence  of initial informations and controls certain unavailable data (garment fit, fabric real color)
* How: the process takes place where the physical garment is available (fairs, show rooms)
* When: the time must be compatible with market requests
* Where: as said, in fairs, show rooms or agents information points
* Who: people involved includes buyers and offering companies
* How much: it could be interesting measuring the distance between the catalogue offering and the real offer; we should interview the customers
* Why: to reduce wasted times

The information system support for this process is, in my knowledge, near to zero. The goal could be a historical feedback system for operators.

''Purchasing''

This process begins after product choice and includes operations related to purchase order creation and control. It is a standard industrial process which we only quote quickly without even getting into details like quotation, offer and order confirmation. 

* What: it is the process of defining the characteristics of the supply in terms
** Physical: goods to be delivered, place and date of delivery, delivery context (packing, labeling etc.)
** Non physical: terms of payment, quality standard, information data.
* How: operational aspect of the purchase order (paper, electronic data interchange)
* When: purchase order can be made in various moments: fairs, later back home
* Where: as before it depends on customer/supplier organization
* Who: entities involved include customer, supplier and, sometimes, third parties like agents or credit companies
* How much: process dimension could not be related to the economical amount (think of small boutiques buying many codes and little quantities) but we could think in terms of SKUs
* Why: it is a steady state both from the physical and the information point of view.

From the information systems point of view, this is one of the best known process and there is plenty of knowledge on it.

''Stock management''

In this process, after we have chosen and ordered the garments, we are to keep track of the physical location.

* What: the process is about knowing where the goods are; they could be at the supplier, in transit, in the warehouse or in the sale area
* How: our system must help us in giving the situation both at the moment and in the next future (e.g. passage from transit to warehouse)
* When: the system must be available always and must give response on inventories at any time
* Where: the process must support people anywhere it is needed, both locally (shops, warehouses) and remote (company headquarter)
* Who: there are operational actors (shop executives, warehouse employee) and control people
* How much: it is obvious that precision is a must; sometime fiscal limits are law defined
* Why: sales points are part of a larger system designed for customer satisfaction.

We need an information system which gives you the situation in any part of the customer dedicated world (supplier, logistics, shops); at the moment we are not yet in this situation.

''Sales area availability''

This point is about the way goods are to be shown so that customer probabilities, to find what he is looking for, get higher.

* What: as we know what the inventory is, we need to balance space vs. goods and to define exposition priorities (paths and areas)
* How: the choices we make must match customer needs and quantities taking into consideration that we might have to cope with missing quantities to be filled in the future
* When: the matching process between goods and space is obviously related to goods availability (spaces are generally fixed on the short term) and to customer visit frequency. It is usually considered a two-three weeks period.
* Where: where the sale takes place
* Who: usually it a is a visual merchandiser job, in smaller sales entities it is a senior sale executive job
* How much: department stores have long studied this problem, it is not in the aim of this paper to get into it
* Why: no doubt a good explosion helps the customer in finding what he is looking for.

From an information point of view, data concern customer and product presence (actual and future), customer revisit attitude and product appeal on the local market.

''After sale behavior.''

To satisfy the customer we must also project to implement after sale behaviors. After sale has two main components: returns and follow-up.

Returns

* What: we are essentially dealing with garments with quality standards not as expected
* How: returns are mainly processed via a shop physical hand back and the substitution with another garment or a refund
* How much: timing is mainly law defined and it might last from a few days (unsatisfaction) to months (quality problems)
* Where: the return process usually happens where the sale process took place
* Who: acting people include the customer, the retailer and the garment company
* How much: it is easy to be measured and, obviously, should be as little as possible
* Why: because this process is somehow part of the sale process, it is a side effect

Follow up

* What: this process help us in defining our new sales standards, it should measure the difference between the relation perception at the sale moment and later in time
* How: we must identify customer correspondence between customer expectation and real result
* Where: we have to be able to re-reach our customers where they stay
* Who: this process is available only for trackable customers so we much try to increase this number
* How much: to be statistically significant
* Why: to drive future sales processes

As far as information system is concerned, returns is a typical summary process so it needs operational and control systems while follow-up is also an analytical process.

In this chapter you will learn what a camera is for and what you need to do with it.

==Why A Camera==
The camera is how you move your view in the game.  You will need it to run around with your character, do some nice cut-scenes and add overlay scenes.

==You Could Do With A Camera==
{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

To add an object press '''SHIFT-A''' and select what type of object you want to make.}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

What is parenting? It basically means that one object will follow another. You can do this by select the to objects you want to parent making sure that the child object (the one you want to follow the other around) is selected first. Then go to the '''Object''' menu at the bottom of the 3D view and go to '''Parent'''&gt;'''Set''' and select '''Object'''. Then confirm this move in the pop-up menu that comes up.}}

First add a camera. Next you can move it to a nice view of the character. Finally you can parent it to the character, making sure the character is the parent. That is one way.

That way will make the camera follow the character no matter what. It will remain firm and will look very un-smooth. You can add a slow parent and this is much preferred for it's ease and nice feel. But you can also use the Camera Actuator:

==Get That Camera Fixed==
Select your camera and add an '''Always''', an '''And''' and a '''Camera''' Actuator. Connect them all. Now fiddle with the settings for the '''Camera''' Actuator. Play the game (by pressing '''P''') and then correct the Camera Actuator until you find a nice setting that fits you. But for ease you can also just use this setting which, generally, works:

Got your camera? Excellent. Now let's add [[Beyond Blender Render/A Destination|A Destination]].

      <comment>/* Hydrophytes */  Aquatic plants transport oxygen; need plenty of light.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is about aquaculture plant and symbiotic organisms in hydroculture systems: the focus is horticultural. Aquaponic and aquascaping organisms are covered in this section.

==Hydrophytes==
[[w:Hydrophytes|Hydrophytes]] are aquatic plants. Aquatic plants can transport oxygen throughout its stem, unlike land plants. Hydrophytes need plenty of light, as in their natural environments.

===Semi-aquatic plants===
Semi-aquatic plants are adapted to live with its root system in both submerged and land based environments. Only during this time, when a plant's root system is submerged it is involved in hydroculture. (cranberry and watercress)

==Symbiotic animals==
Animals in aquaponics or aquaculture form a [[w:symbiotic|symbiotic]] relationship with plant-life. Aquatic animals need some light like in their natural environments.

===Freshwater===
[[w:Goldfish|Goldfish]], [[w:Loricariidae|Loricariidae catfish]], [[w:Freshwater mollusc|snails]] and [[w:Freshwater shrimp|shrimp]] eat algae.

===Plant-like animals===
[[w:Coral|Coral]] are a saltwater animal that require high maintenance. There are freshwater and saltwater [[w:sponge|sponge]].

==Aquaponics==

==Aquascaping==
Saltwater aquascaping is for aesthetic reasons.
Coral, sponges and saltwater plants may (possibly) form a symbiotic relationship.

(Aquarium keeping, fishkeeping, other symbiotic animals and aquascaping)

==Aquatic gardening==
garden ponds

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition which causes a temporary narrowing and constricting of the airways. This airway inflammation is a result of mucus production, muscle tightening, and swollen bronchial membranes in the airways.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;&gt;Anderson, S.D. and Daviskas, E. (2000). ''The mechanism of exercise-induced asthma is..''. Department of Respiratory Medicine. 106(3). 453-459.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors which induce asthmatic symptoms in patients, called triggers, vary between individuals as does the severity of the condition. 

Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) occurs when asthma symptoms are stimulated by vigorous exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt; Exercise itself does not cause asthma, however it is quite often a trigger, and affects about 90% of regular asthma sufferers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;Afrasiabi, R. ''Exercise-Induced Asthma: Sports and Athletes''. Current Clinical Practice. 5. 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this activity is aerobic in nature, with certain sports such as long distance running, cycling and cross-country skiing more likely to cause worsened symptoms than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Fitch, K.D. and Morton, A.R. (1971). ''Specificity of Exercise in Exercise-induced Asthma''. British Medical Journal. 4(5787). 577-581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Schnall, R.P and Landua, L.I. (1980). ''Protective effects of repeated short sprints in exercise-induced asthma''. Thorax. 35. 828-832&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spirometry is used to diagnose exercise-induced asthma, and is present when there is a reduction in forced expiratory volume or peak expiratory flow following aerobic activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;/&gt; As of 2011, approximately 1 in 10 (over 2 million total) Australians suffer from Asthma.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2011). ''Asthma''. Australia. Retrieved from http://www.aihw.gov.au/asthma/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on Exercise Participation ==

Whilst it is generally recommended that asthma sufferers avoid potential triggers, having exercise-induced asthma should not stop someone from enjoying the benefits of exercise, or from reaching their exercise goals.

===== Symptoms&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;/&gt; =====
* Generally start 5-20 minutes after beginning exercise, and peak 5-10 minutes after stopping exercise
* Coughing and wheezing
* Excessive phlegm
* Chest pain
* Prolonged shortness of breath
* Elevated and irregular respiratory rate
* Extreme fatigue

===== How Aerobic Activity Induces Asthma Symptoms =====
When at rest, breathing through the nose serves to warm and humidify air before it travels through the airways to the lungs. 
The increased demand for oxygen when exercising results in a switch from breathing through the nose to the mouth. The air from this passageway is therefore a lot colder and drier because it has not been warmed and humidified in the nasal passage. This contrast in the air temperature can lead to asthmatic symptoms due to the increased risk and sensitivity of the bronchial smooth muscle lining the airways to inflammation and contraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;Anderson, S.D. and Holzer, K. (2000). ''Exercise-induced asthma: Is it the right diagnosis in elite athletes?''. Department of Respiratory Medicine. 106(3). 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;McFadden, E.R. (1987). ''Exercise-Induced Asthma: Assessment of Current Etiologic Concepts''. Asthma and Allergic Disease Center. 91(6). 151-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Refractory Period =====
If symptoms of asthma or of an asthmatic attack occur as a result of exercise, it is often followed by a period of time where the lungs and airways are less likely to respond as strongly. This is referred to as the refractory period, and can last for anywhere up to two hours after the beginning of physical activity. Some exercise-induced asthma sufferers will know their condition well enough that they can use the refractory period as a loophole for participating in aerobic activity without symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Edmunds, A.T., Tooley, M. and Godfrey, S. (1978). ''The refractory period after exercise-induced asthma: its duration and relation to the severity of exercise''. The American Review of Respiratory Disease. 117(2). 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to Control Exercise-Induced Asthma==

Treatment of exercise induced asthma with regards to aerobic training should aim to minimise the risk and prevalence of an asthma attack. Medication is often prescribed depending on the severity of the asthma. Bronchodilators used during or before exercise to assist in keeping the airways relaxed and open, or anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the sensitivity of the airways, are commonly used to prevent symptoms during aerobic training.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;&gt;Fitch, K.D., Sue-Chu, M., Anderson, S.D., Boulet, L.P., Hancox, R.J., McKenzie, D.C., Backer, V., Rundell, K.W., Alonso, J.M., Kippelen, P., Cummiskey, J.M., Garnier, A. and Ljungqvist, A. (2008). ''Asthma and the elite athlete: Summary of the International Olympic Committee’s Consensus Conference''. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. 122(2). 254-260&lt;/ref&gt; Elite athletes need to ensure the legality of the medication they are taking within their National Federation Anti-Doping Agency, as a large portion of pharmaceutical prescriptions can be found on the banned substance list.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;/&gt;

===== Management During Exercise =====

Suggested management techniques for participating aerobic activities:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Before Exercise !! During Exercise !! After Exercise
|-
| Avoid potential triggers. Eg. Dust, cold air, cigarette smoke || Have any prescribed medication on-hand and ready to administer if needed. || Light warm down and stretching.
|-
| Warm up appropriately to allow the body to adapt to changes. Greater than 10 minutes can take also take advantage of the refractory period || Cease exercise if symptoms persist. Do not resume exercise until these have subsided || Refer to doctor if any symptoms continue.
|-
| Preventative medication advised by a doctor is common 5-10 minutes before exercise. || Include rest periods throughout the exercise. || Get to know your asthma condition so you know yourself the best way to manage it.
|-
| Consider the training environment. || It is not encouraged to ‘run through’ an asthma attack. || 
|}

== Exercise Recommendations ==

As well as the obvious health benefits of regular aerobic exercise, physical activity is generally considered beneficial for those with asthma;&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;Orenstein, D.M. (2002). ''Pulmonary problems and management concerns in youth sports''. Pediatric Clinic of North America. 49. 709-721.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular aerobic training increases muscular strength and cardiopulmonary endurance, therefore reducing the ventilation rate required for specific tasks. This reduces the strain on the cardiorespiratory system during exercise and decreases the risk of an asthma attack for low intensity exercise.
* Good cardiovascular fitness will allow exercise at a greater intensity before experiencing symptoms.
* Resistance training focusing on strengthening the muscles of the respiratory tract can also help when it comes to aerobic training.

The following is a summary of how asthma can respond to aerobic training with regards to the likelihood of provoking exercise induced asthma symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Higher Risk !! Lower Risk
|-
| Continuous aerobic activity || Lower intensity activites interspersed with regular rest periods or breaks
|-
| Higher intensity endurance activity|| Exercising indoors or in warm environments
|-
| Exercising outdoors where the air is polluted or cold || For example; short distance running or short sprinting, walking, golf, gymnastics 
|-
| For example; long distance running, cycling, cross country skiing, cold-water swimming|| Swimming in heated pools is especially beneficial as the pool environment aids in the warming and humidifying of the air as you breath

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Roots of a hydroponically-grown plant.jpg|250px|right]]
Roots must breathe [[Hydroculture/Aeration|oxygen]]. There is a limit to the amount of dissolved gasses that can be contained in water. [[w:Aquatic plant|Aquatic plant]] roots do not need direct access to oxygen in the water or medium, because these plants are [[w:Aerenchyma|adapted to transport oxygen throughout its physiological system]].

[[File:Rhizosphere.svg|thumb|300px|An illustration of the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DOI|10.1007/3-540-26609-7_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A=[[w:Amoeba|Amoeba]] consuming bacteria; BL=Energy limited [[w:bacteria|bacteria]]; BU=Non-energy limited bacteria; RC=Root derived carbon; SR=Sloughed root hair cells; F=Fungal [[w:hyphae|hyphae]]; N=[[w:Nematode|Nematode]] worm]]

==Rhizosphere==

The '''rhizosphere''' is the narrow region around the root that is directly influenced by [[w:root|root]] secretions and associated [[w:microorganism|microorganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uwstudentweb.uwyo.edu/T/Twhite/ | title = Microbial Health of the Rhizosphere | accessdate =5 May 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhizosphere contains many [[w:bacteria|bacteria]] that feed on sloughed-off plant cells, termed ''rhizodeposition'', and the proteins and sugars released by roots. [[w:Protozoa|Protozoa]] and [[w:nematode|nematode]]s that graze on bacteria are also more abundant in the rhizosphere. Thus, much of the nutrient cycling and disease suppression needed by plants occurs immediately adjacent to roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/concepts/soil_biology/soil_food_web.html | title = The Soil Food Web | publisher = [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]-[[w:NRCS|NRCS]] | accessdate =3 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretions and endophytes==
{{see|w:endophyte}}
Plants secrete many compounds into the rhizosphere which serve different functions. [[w:Strigolactone|Strigolactone]], secreted and detected by [[w:mycorhiza|mycorhiza]]l fungi, stimulate the [[w:germination|germination]] of spores and initiate changes in the mycorhiza that allow it to colonize the root. Symbiotic [[w:Nitrogen fixation|Nitrogen-fixing]] bacteria, such as the ''[[w:Rhizobium|Rhizobium]]'' species, detect an unknown compound secreted by the roots of leguminous plants and then produce [[w:nod factor|nod factor]]s which signal to the plant that they are present and will lead to the formation of [[w:root nodule|root nodule]]s, in which the bacterium, sustained by nutrients from the plant, converts nitrogen gas to a form that can be used by the plant. Non-symbiotic (or &quot;free-living&quot;) nitrogen-fixing bacteria may reside in the rhizosphere just outside the roots of certain plants (including many grasses), and similarly &quot;fix&quot; nitrogen gas in the nutrient-rich plant rhizosphere.  Even though these organisms are thought to be only loosely associated with plants they inhabit, they may respond very strongly to the status of the plants. For example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere of the [[w:rice plant|rice plant]] exhibit [[w:Diurnality|diurnal]] cycles that mimic plant behavior, and tend to supply more fixed nitrogen during growth stages when the plant exhibits a high demand for nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sims GK, Dunigan EP |year=1984 |title=Diurnal and seasonal variations in nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction) of rice roots |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=15–18 |doi=10.1016/0038-0717(84)90118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Benefits of moderate aerobic exercise on Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis''' ==

=== Background ===
Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease is a degenerative disorder of specific nerve cells of the spinal cord, brain stem and the brain itself that affects the upper and lower parts of the body. Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis is the most common disease in a group of diseases known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND). It is a neurological disease that selectively affects the nerves of the body which are specifically known as motor neurons. Motor neurons are cells that control voluntary muscle action and help us preform everyday actions such as walking, speaking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body. Being a neuron muscular disease, once Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis reaches the majority of neurons there is nothing exercise can do as the patient is completely bed ridden through partial or complete paralysation.&lt;ref&gt;Lui, A.J. and Byl, N.N. (2009) A systematic review of the effect of moderate intensity exercise on function and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Journal of Neurological Physical Therapy 33, 68-87&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Risk and symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
ALS generally strikes patients of middle age (25 to 55) and is more often found in men than women. In the initial stages of ALS symptoms can be so slight that they are often overlooked. The earliest symptoms are weakness and/or muscle atrophy.Yet this can often be disguised if a person does physical activity as they perceive it as just natural fatigue. Other initial symptoms include muscle fasciculation (twitching), cramping or muscle stiffness and slurred or nasal speech. These symptoms can come in any particular order and will depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first. &lt;ref&gt;Lopes de Almeida, J. P., Silvestre, R., Pinto A. C., and de Carvalho, M. (2012) Exercise and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Neurological Sciences 33, 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As symptoms progress each part of the body beginnings slowing down and eventually reaches a parasitic state. From this stage death is inevitable. In recent years more and more neurologists are stating that “Physical inactivity could expose people with ALS to even greater health risks, and exercise in moderation can bring the benefits of exercise while minimizing the risk of worsening their conditions”. When you look into it, there is no stone cold evidence that exercise can actually do damage to patients yet there is evidence for the benefits.


=== Aerobic exercise benefits for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
Exercise is used to improve health, maintain fitness and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation. In relationship to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, moderate aerobic exercise is vital in two important ways. The first way is for prolonging the symptoms from multiplying and the second is for the prevention of the disease all together. Between the years of 1992 and 2011 five major studies where done suggesting that Aerobic exercise played a major role in prolonging of ALS symptoms and the increased quality of life. These studies are as followed:

* '''1992:''' scientist discovered that short moderate aerobic exercise boosted the levels of neurotrophins in the brain. Neurotrophin are a substance of the brain that protects motor neurons and triggers growth of new motor neurons.
* '''1995:''' studys where done in which rats did moderate running exercise each day for one week. It was found that these rats had doubled levels of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor)&lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2000:''' researchers found that increase levels of neurotrophin following moderate aerobic exercise actually helped protect the brain in rats from injury or neuron diseases. &lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2003-2005:''' two groups of rats with ALS were tested. The first group did moderate running exercise over the space of several weeks while the second group did moderate swimming over the same amount of time. Both sets of groups came back with positive results. In the first group it was reported that moderate running actually increased the lifespan of rats with ALS. While in the second group it was found that swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%. &lt;ref&gt;Kirkinezos, I.G, Hernandez, D., Bradley, W.G. and Moraes, C.T (2003) Regular exercise is beneficial to a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Annals of Neurology 53, 804-807&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2011:''' researchers found that aerobic exercise not only increased neurotrophins but had the potential to keep the power on in the motor nerves by increasing the amount of oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Oligodendrocytes are cells of the brain and spinal cord that supply critical energy to mitochondria keeping the energy flowing in distal axon and nerve terminals. They do this by making up the myelin sheath which extends and speeds up the functioning of the neurons.This meant that symptoms decreased and the quality of life increased. &lt;ref&gt; Nave, K.A. (2010) Myelination and the trophic support of long axons. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 11. 275-283 &lt;/ref&gt;

These tests showed that through moderate aerobic exercise both neurotrophins and Oligodendrocytes are increased or maintained allowing for a decrease in the rate of destruction of motor neurons. This meaning that the onset of the diseases was a lot less severe and allows patients to live longer and healthier lives. It is important to note that aerobic exercise does not reverse the disease but only delays the onset.

=== Moderate aerobic exercise activities suited for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis  === 
Moderate aerobic exercise activities are vital when attempting to prolong the onset of ALS, recommeded exercises are:   
* walking
* swimming 
* stationary cycling
It is important that these exercises are all done at 60 to 65% of a persons oxygen output, last no longer than 30 minutes and are partaken at least 3 times a week. This intensity allowed weakened muscles to preform exercise without overworking or damaging them and promotes the increase of protective substances in the brain and spinal cord. By doing this exersice it keeps fast twitch muscles active and oxidates them slowing down the process of atrophy. It also found that patients had significant signs of reduced functional decline and increased post rehabilitation survival. &lt;ref&gt;Neeper, S.A., Goauctemez-Pinilla, F., Choi, J. and cotman, C. (1995) Exercise and neurotrophins. Nature 373, 109&lt;/ref&gt;. While swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%.

=== Further reseach ===
Further research is being done to find out more about the effects of aerobic exercise in ALS patients. Testing still needs to be done on how different intensities may affect the disease and if resistance exercise can play a role. But what we are sure of is that any form of moderate aerobic exercise weather it is swimming, running or cycling can have a positive result rather than no exercise at all. It can increase the neurotrophins and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord allowing for a reduced functional decline and increased survival rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpatkin&quot; &gt;&quot;Multiple Sclerosis and Exercise - a review of the evidence&quot; Author: H, Karpatkin. International Journal of MS care (2005)vol 7, 36-41&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring episodes of MS can cause scarring in the central nervous system as a result of the breakdown of myelin, the insulating material that covers the nerve fibres. This can result in impairment of motor, sensory and cognitive functions. 

The cause of MS is unknown and there is no known cure. The primary treatment for MS is pharmacological to help control exacerbation of the symptoms associated with the disease.

==Symptoms==
The symptoms of MS are associated with the scarring of the central nervous system. The physical symptoms of MS usually present as a combination of&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpatkin&quot; /&gt;:
:*Visual impairment
:*Loss of coordination and balance
:*Muscle spasms
:*Fatigue
:*Speech impediment

==Barriers to Exercise==
Despite health promoting benefits, many MS patients are often hesitant to participate in physical activity for fear of increasing symptoms or worsening the condition&lt;ref name=&quot;stroud et.al&quot; &gt;&quot;The perceived benefits and barriers to exercise participation in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis&quot; Author: N, Stroud et al. Disability and Rehabilitation Journal. (2009); vol 31(26), pg 2216–2222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker et al&quot; &gt;&quot;What makes it so hard? Barriers to health promotion Experienced by people with Multiple sclerosis and polio&quot; Author: H, Becker et al. . Family and community health Journal. (2003); vol 27(1) pg 75–85&lt;/ref&gt;

MS patients report several reasons for avoiding physical activity including:
:*Fatigue accentuating symptoms following exercise
:*Perceived inability to exercise
:*Perceived lack of physical activity benefits
:*Increased scarring exacerbation

There are only a few symptoms which are shown to present a barrier to physical activity in MS patients, such as:
:*Loss of coordination and balance during exercise resulting in injury
:*Physical impairment

==Benefits of Exercise==
Physical activity has demonstrated many benefits to physical and mental health for sufferers of MS and shown that correct implementation of exercise programmes to be safe for MS patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpatkin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;petaja&quot; &gt;&quot;Recommendations for Physical Activity in Patients with Multiple sclerosis&quot; Author: J, Petaja. Sports Medicine Journal. (1999);  27(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise has been shown to have physical health benefits such as:
:*Reduce MS symptoms severity and prevalence
:*Slow degeneration of MS
:*Improve muscular strength
:*Improve balance and coordination
:*Reduce feelings of fatigue
:*Reduce other disease morbidities

Exercise has also been shown to have benefits to the mental health of MS patients such as:
:*Improve wellbeing
:*Reduce depression
:*Improve self-esteem
:*Improve social interactions and support networks

===Recommendations &amp; Precautions===

Exercise is beneficial to assist in reduction of symptoms for MS sufferers. Some types of training for MS patients include:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Exercise and the prevention of atherosclerosis''' ==

=== '''Background/ Explanation of the issue''' ===
[[Category:Exercise as it relates to Disease]]

Atherosclerosis is a disease characterised by hardening of the arteries in the body. This process often occurs as a result of ageing or lifestyle because over time the arteries become harder from the formation of plaques. &lt;ref name=&quot;A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia&quot;&gt; A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia. 2012. Hardening of the arteries [Online]. Available: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001224/ [Accessed 22 October 2012].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Atherosclerosis is a condition that is associated with metabolic syndrome &lt;ref name=&quot;Vaidya&quot;&gt; VAIDYA, D., SZKLO, M., CUSHMAN, M., HOLVOET, P., POLAK, J., BAHRAMI, H., JENNY, N. S. &amp; OUYANG, P. 2011. Association of endothelial and oxidative stress with metabolic syndrome and subclinical atherosclerosis: multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, 65, 818-825.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Atherosclerosis has an inflammatory effect and is also associated with thickening of the arterial wall surface due to plaque deposits &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot;&gt; MOTTAGHI, A., SALEHI, E., SEZAVAR, H., KESHAVARZ, S. A., ESHRAGHIAN, M. R., REZAEI, N., REJALI, L. &amp; SABOOR-YARAGHI, A.-A. 2012. The in vitro Effect of Oxidized LDL and PHA on Proliferation and Gene Expression of Regulatory T Cells in Patients with Atherosclerosis. Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology, 11, 217-223.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oxidative processes are important along with inflammation in the lead up to rupturing of plaque and thrombosis which can occur in this disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Cymbron&quot;&gt;.CYMBRON, T., RAPOSO, M., KAZACHKOVA, N., BETTENCOURT, C., SILVA, F., SANTOS, C., DAHMANI, Y., LOURENÇO, P., FERIN, R., PAVÃO, M. L. &amp; LIMA, M. 2011.  Cross-sectional study of risk factors for atherosclerosis in the Azorean population. Annals of Human Biology, 38, 354-359. &lt;/ref&gt; Oxidised low-density lipoprotein is involved in the initiation of plaque build up. Oxidised LDL assists T cells so they can adhere to vessel endothelium, in this way it contributes to development of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot; /&gt;
Platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and the reactions between them are the characteristic elements of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Huang&quot;&gt;.HUANG, C.-C., LIU, K., POPE, R. M., DU, P., LIN, S., RAJAMANNAN, N. M., HUANG, Q.-Q., JAFARI, N., BURKE, G. L., POST, W., WATSON, K. E., JOHNSON, C., DAVIGLUS, M. L. &amp; LLOYD-JONES, D. M. 2011. Activated TLR signaling in atherosclerosis among women with lower Framingham risk score: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. PLoS ONE, 6, e21067-e21067.
&lt;/ref&gt;
T lymphocytes are the cells that have a major involvement in the development of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot; /&gt; .T regulatory cells have the ability to inhibit atherosclerosis by controlling production of T cells &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot; /&gt;. Cardiovascular disease frequently occurs as a result of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Cymbron&quot; /&gt;. It has been found that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease is lowered if the individual’s diet has a high fruit and vegetable content. However, vitamin supplements do not seem to have an effect in minimising cardiovascular disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Agarwal&quot;&gt;.AGARWAL, M., MEHTA, P. K., DWYER, J. H., DWYER, K. M., SHIRCORE, A. M., NORDSTROM, C. K., SUN, P., PAUL-LABRADOR, M., YANG, Y. &amp; MERZ, C. N. B. 2012. Differing Relations to Early Atherosclerosis between Vitamin C from Supplements vs. Food in the Los Angeles Atherosclerosis Study: A Prospective Cohort Study. The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal, 6, 113-121.  
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Risk of developing atherosclerosis is measured by carotid artery intimal medial thickness, and it’s progression can be linked with cardiovascular issues &lt;ref name=&quot;Agarwal&quot; /&gt;

=== '''Importance of Exercise''' ===

Studies have shown that physical activity can improve endothelial function when atherosclerosis is present. Exercise is also beneficial for individuals with risk factors for coronary artery disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Roitman&quot;&gt; ROITMAN, J. L. &amp; LAFONTAINE, T. 2006. Special populations. Exercise, atherosclerosis, and the endothelium: where the action is (part II). Strength &amp; Conditioning Journal (Allen Press), 28, 75-77.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Regular exercise has been found to be helpful in managing and preventing atherosclerosis and is a recommendation for individuals affected by coronary artery disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Reid&quot;&gt;. REID, R. D., TULLOCH, H., KOCOUREK, J., MORRIN, L. I., BEATON, L. J., PAPADAKIS, S., BLANCHARD, C. M., RILEY, D. L. &amp; PIPE, A. L. 2007. Who will be active? Predicting exercise stage transitions after hospitalization for coronary artery diseaseThis paper is one of a selection of papers published in this Special Issue, entitled Young Investigators' Forum. Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, 85, 17-23. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
=== '''Benefits of resistance training on the prevention of atherosclerosis''' ===
Benefits of resistance training on the prevention of atherosclerosis:
Atherosclerosis is associated with an individual’s lifestyle and therefore this can be modified to help in the prevention of the disease. For example it has been linked with:
 
:*High serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;&gt; BERENSON, G. S., SRINIVASAN, S. R., BAO, W., NEWMAN, W. P., TRACY, R. E. &amp; WATTIGNEY, W. A. 1998. Association between Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Atherosclerosis in Children and Young Adults. New England Journal of Medicine, 338, 1650-1656.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Elevations in body-mass index (BMI) &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot; /&gt; 

:*Elevation in systolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot; /&gt;

:*General physical inactivity &lt;ref name=&quot;Kadoglou&quot;&gt; KADOGLOU, N. P. E., ILIADIS, F. &amp; LIAPIS, C. D. 2008. Exercise and carotid atherosclerosis. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, 35, 264-272.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several studies which have shown the benefit of resistance exercise on these factors. Progressive resistance training has been associated with decreases in:

:*Total cholesterol &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot;&gt; KELLEY, G. A. &amp; KELLEY, K. S. 2009. Impact of progressive resistance training on lipids and lipoproteins in adults: Another look at a meta-analysis using prediction intervals. Preventive Medicine, 49, 473-475.
&lt;/ref&gt;
:*non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

:*low density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

:*triglycerides in adults &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

:*both systolic and diastolic blood pressure  &lt;ref name=&quot;Fagard&quot;&gt; FAGARD, R. H. 2006. Exercise is good for your blood pressure: effects of endurance training and resistance training. Clinical &amp; Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology, 33, 853-856.
&lt;/ref&gt;
==== '''Recommendations for resistance training''' ====
A doctor should be consulted before the onset of any vigorous exercise for individuals with any cardiovascular problems &lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;. THOMPSON, P. D., BUCHNER, D., PIÑA, I. L., BALADY, G. J., WILLIAMS, M. A., MARCUS, B. H., BERRA, K., BLAIR, S. N., COSTA, F., FRANKLIN, B., FLETCHER, G. F., GORDON, N. F., PATE, R. R., RODRIGUEZ, B. L., YANCEY, A. K. &amp; WENGER, N. K. 2003. Exercise and physical activity in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Circulation, 107, 3109-3116.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Exercise should be stopped and medical advice immediately sought if the individual experiences, recurring chest pain, unusual shortness of breath, dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;&gt; FRANKLIN, A. B., BALADY, J. G., BERRA, K., GORDON, F. N. &amp; POLLOCK, L. M. 2012. Exercise for persons with cardiovascular disease [Online]. Available: http://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/exercise-for-persons-with-cardiovascular-disease.pdf [Accessed 4 October 2012].     
&lt;/ref&gt;
The resistance training recommendations for individuals with cardiovascular disease include : 

:*Single set. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt; 
:*Performed a minimum 2-3 times a week. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;
:*8-10 different exercises using the major muscle groups (shoulders, arms, chest, back, hips and legs). &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;
:*10-15 reps at a moderate level of fatigue. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;
:*If a high risk individual, avoid any extremely strenuous exercises. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a form of anxiety disorder in which sufferers experience excessive and unnecessary anxiety and worry about regular occurrences in everyday life. In Australia, GAD affects approximately 3-6% of the population and is most common during mid-life. The onset of GAD can be genetic or caused by prolonged stress or a traumatic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=C|title=DSM-IV Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=109455|publisher=Psychological Medicine Journal|accessdate=Saturday 20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of anxiety can be classified as either mental (affecting the psyche) or somatic (affecting the body but excluding the psyche). Mental symptoms can be categorised as apprehension and vigilance, whilst somatic symptoms can be categorised as either motor-based or exaggerated physiological responses.

In order to meet diagnostic criteria for GAD, patients must suffer from persistent and uncontrollable apprehension, and the consequential somatic responses, for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kessler|first=R.C|title=Patterns and Correlates of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in Community Samples|url=http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i2/klinische/studium/literatur/587.pdf|accessdate=20/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Common Treatments ==
Common treatments for GAD include:
* Pharmacotherapy
* Cognitive behaviour therapy
* Hypnotherapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Renu|title=Hypononsis: Psycho-philosophical Perspectives and Therapeutic Evidence|year=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Dehli|isbn=13-978-81-8069-727-2|pages=207–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dietary modifications (elimination of caffeine and alcohol)

Exercise can be used in conjunction with these treatments to help minimise the symptoms of GAD.

== Barriers to Exercise or Physical Activity ==
There are several factors that dictate the likelihood of a GAD patient adhering to an exercise regime:
* Interest in the activity
* Perception of physical activity and exercise (i.e. incidental physical activity)
* Motivation
* Fatigue
* Low self-esteem
* Mind control

The rate of diabetes in Australia has shown a steady increase from 2.4% in 1995 to 3.8% in 2007–08&lt;ref name=&quot;National&quot; &gt; &quot;National Health Survey, 1995, 2001, 2004-05 and 2007-08 http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4820.0.55.001main+features32007-08 &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;
In 2007-08, '''10%''' of the Australian population who suffered from diabetes (82,000 people) reported they had Type 1 diabetes, while '''2%''' of people with diabetes did not know which type of diabetes they had&lt;ref name=&quot;National&quot; /&gt;.

==Aerobic Exercise==
Type 1 diabetes mellitus sufferers often tend to avoid participating in aerobic exercise due to fear of enhancing more acute symptoms relating to the disease&lt;ref name= &quot;Zisser&quot; &gt; &quot;Zisser, H., Sueyoshi, M., Krigstein, K., Szigiato, A., &amp; Riddell, M. C. (2012). Advances in exercise, physical activity and diabetes mellitus. International Journal Of Clinical Practice (Supplement), 6662-71. doi:10.1111/j.1742-1241.2011.02856.x http://www.yorku.ca/mriddell/documents/Zisseretal2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; &gt; &quot;Cohen ST, Jacobson AM. Psychological benefits of exercise. In: Ruderman NB, Devlin JT, Schneider SH, Kriska A, editors. Handbook of exercise in diabetes. 2nd ed. Alexandria, VA: American Diabetes Association; 2002 http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/30/5/article/911.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Although this practice may reduce the immediate effects T1DM places on the body, it may increase the prevalence of other lifestyle complications including:
* '''Increased''' weight gain
* '''Decreased''' muscle mass
* '''Decreased''' bone density
* '''Decrease''' insulin sensitivity
* '''Decreased''' life expectancy
* '''Increased''' risk of lifestyle diseases
&lt;br/&gt;
These problems can affect common everyday tasks such as making it difficult to walk up a flight of stairs. They also dramatically affect the long term health of the patient.
&lt;br/ &gt;
&lt;br/ &gt;
===Benefits of Aerobic Exercise===
Recent research has shown sufficient evidence to indicate that aerobic exercise does not negatively affect Type I diabetes mellitus symptoms and is completely safe for patients suffering with well-controlled diabetes mellitus &lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersen&quot; &gt; &quot;Pedersen, O., H. Beck-Nielsen, et al. (1980). &quot;Increased Insulin Receptors after Exercise in Patients with Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus.&quot; New England Journal of Medicine 302(16): 886-892 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198004173021603&lt;/ref&gt;.  Aerobic exercise has been shown to:
* '''Improve''' glucose tolerance &lt;ref name= &quot;Pedersen&quot; /&gt;
* '''Reduce''' insulin requirements/increase insulin sensitivity &lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersen&quot; /&gt;
* Potentially '''lower''' glycosylated haemoglobin &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; &gt; &quot;KOMATSU, W. R., BARROS NETO, T. L., CHACRA, A. R., &amp; DIB, S. A. (2010). Aerobic Exercise Capacity and Pulmonary Function in Athletes With and Without Type 1 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 33(12), 2555-2557. doi:10.2337/dc10-0769 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992189/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reduced''' risk of CVD, hypertension, colon cancer, obesity and osteoporosis &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Increased''' overall life expectancy &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Increased''' CV endurance, muscle fitness and flexibility &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Aerobic exercise also contributes to psychological health benefits &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt; which may include:
* '''Improved''' self-esteem &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Enhanced''' sense of well-being &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Improved''' social interaction skills
&lt;br/&gt;

===Recommendations- Aerobic Exercise===
In order to gain the maximum benefits from aerobic exercise, the following recommendations should be followed:
* 5 sessions/week &lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt;
* 60-90% MHR &lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt; depending on individual
* 30-90 mins &lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt;
* Each training program may need to be personalised with GP recommendations and a pre-screening check
&lt;br/&gt;
This research may show that aerobic exercise, when taking correct responsibility for the varying insulin requirements, reduces the symptoms of T1DM. Even though this predominantly refers to med-high intensity over med-long duration, everyday occurrences will also have a positive effect on minimising symptoms of the disease. These may include:
* Walking to work
* Taking stairs rather than escalator/lift
* Taking dog for a run on a more common basis
&lt;br/&gt;

==Precautions==
Although research suggests that aerobic exercise is safe to participate in &lt;ref name= &quot;Zisser&quot; /&gt; some considerations must be taken:
* Discuss intended training plan with doctor prior to commencing.
* Frequently monitor blood-glucose levels during exercise.
* Cease exercise if any abnormal symptoms appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a form of anxiety disorder in which sufferers experience excessive and unnecessary anxiety and worry about regular occurrences in everyday life. In Australia, GAD affects approximately 3-6% of the population and is most common during adolescence and mid-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=C|title=DSM-IV Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=109455|publisher=Psychological Medicine Journal|accessdate=Saturday 20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of GAD can either be genetic, caused by prolonged stress, a traumatic experience or distorted beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=D.M|title=Anxiety Disorders: Why They Persist and How to Treat Them|journal=Journal of Behaviour Research and Therapy|year=1999|volume=37|pages=5–27| accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of anxiety can be classified as either mental (affecting the psyche) or somatic (affecting the body but excluding the psyche). Mental symptoms can be categorised as apprehension and vigilance, whilst somatic symptoms can be categorised as either motor-based or exaggerated physiological responses.

In order to meet diagnostic criteria for GAD, patients must suffer from persistent and uncontrollable apprehension, and the consequential somatic responses, for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kessler|first=R.C|title=Patterns and Correlates of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in Community Samples|url=http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i2/klinische/studium/literatur/587.pdf|accessdate=20/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comorbidities ==
GAD has a high comorbidity rate as many symptoms of GAD overlap with those of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression, bipolar and other forms of anxiety (namely social phobia and panic disorder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=N.M|title=Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Psychiatric Comorbidities such as Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Substance Abuse|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|year=2009|volume=70|pages=10–14|doi=10.4088/JCP.s.7002.02|accessdate=17/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common Treatments ==
Common treatments for GAD include:
* Pharmacotherapy
* Cognitive behaviour therapy
* Hypnotherapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Renu|title=Hypononsis: Psycho-philosophical Perspectives and Therapeutic Evidence|year=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Dehli|isbn=13-978-81-8069-727-2|pages=207–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dietary modifications (elimination of caffeine and alcohol) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=R.N|title=Drugs Which Induce Anxiety: Caffeine|journal=New Zealand Journal of Psychology|year=1996|month=June|volume=25|issue=1|pages=36–42|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise can be used in conjunction with these treatments to help minimise the symptoms of GAD.

== Barriers to Exercise or Physical Activity ==
There are several factors that dictate the likelihood of a GAD patient adhering to an exercise regime:
* Interest in the activity
* Perception of physical activity and exercise (i.e. incidental physical activity)
* Motivation
* Fatigue
* Low self-esteem
* Mind control

== Benefits of Exercise ==
* Endorphin release which masks pain, and produces feelings of euphoria and well-being &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harbor|first=VJ|title=Endorphins and Exercise|url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/6091217|publisher=Journal of Sports Medicine|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress relief and clearing and calming of the mind
* Lower resting heart rate - elevated heart rate is a symptom of GAD and exercise works to regulate this &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Diana|title=Anti-Anxiety Workout|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/anxiety-and-exercise.aspx|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lowering airway resistance which improves the breathing difficulties experienced by GAD sufferers
* Aids in alleviating muscle tension associated with GAD
* Improves concentration

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Aerobic exercise is the recommended exercise modality, as it is more pleasurable and achievable for the patient, and therefore increases the likelihood of adherence. Brisk walking, jogging, cycling and swimming are best. Exercising in social situations (for example, social tennis or dancing) is beneficial in two ways; the body undergoes the physiological adaptations associated with exercise, whilst also relieving emotional tension and improving self-value. Constantly elevated heart rate is a complication associated with GAD, however aerobic exercise improves the efficiency of the heart, thus lowering resting heart rate and helping to alleviate this symptom. &lt;sup&gt; [9] &lt;/sub&gt; Yoga is recommended, and, whilst is it not seen as an aerobic exercise, it 
calms the body, regulates breathing, and alleviates stress, whilst also stretching the muscles and strengthening the body.

== Further Research, Reading and Support ==
It is well-documented that there is a positive link between exercise and its role in preventing or lessening the burden of mental illness, however the clinical recommendations for exercise prescription are very general and limited. Future studies into standardising an exercise regime for sufferers of mental illness would be extremely beneficial in both prevention and treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death in Australia, accounting for 34% of all deaths in 2007-08. The 2007-08 National Health Survey (NHS) reported Hypertension as the most common CVD, reported by 9% of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported CVD as the highest health expenditure of all disease groups, accounting for 11.3% of Australia’s total allocated health spending &lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008. 2007-2008 National Health Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypertension is a cardiovascular disorder characterised by a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mmHg. To avoid ‘white coat’ hypertension, it is commonly measured using 24 hour ambulatory methods. Gestational hypertension is the new-onset of hypertension, typically presenting 20 weeks after gestation, and involves little to no urine protein content. Some women progress from Gestational hypertension to Preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is defined as gestational hypertension, plus proteinuria (300&amp;nbsp;mg or more per 24-hourperiod).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sibai&quot;&gt;Sibai, B. M. &quot;Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Hypertension and Preeclampsia.&quot; American College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. 2003. 102(1), 181-92&lt;/ref&gt; This complication occurs in roughly 2-8% of women but however is manageable upon early detection. A complication exists here because physical symptoms often present late or not at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;&gt;Meher S, Duley L. Exercise or other physical activity for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2006;2&lt;/ref&gt; Literature has reported that insulin resistance in early stages of pregnancy may serve as predisposition marker for gestational hypertension.&lt;ref name=&quot;carpenter&quot;&gt;Carpenter, M. W. &quot;Gestational Diabetes, Pregnancy Hypertension, and Late Vascular Disease.&quot; Diabetes Care 30.Supplement_2. 2007. S246-250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seely&quot;&gt;Seely, E. W., and C. G. Solomon. &quot;Insulin Resistance and Its Potential Role in Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension.&quot; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism. 2003.  88(6), 2393-398.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Pregnancy and Hypertension ==
Gestational hypertension is different to pre-existing Hypertension; however both carry risks for the mother and the baby. Hypertension in pregnancy can cause strokes, seizures, renal damage and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;heart&quot;&gt;Heart foundation of Australia, 2012. Cardiovascular Conditions: High blood pressure. http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/cardiovascular-conditions/Pages/blood-pressure.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Different demographics will experience higher instance of hypertension during pregnancy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) found that in 2008, 14% of birth-mothers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander high blood pressure during their pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;/&gt;
=== Foetal Risk ===
Due to the high pressure in the vascular network, capillary walls are damaged and blood flow is hampered. Neural tube defects and lack of blood flow can also cause maternal hyperthermia.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfe&quot;&gt;Wolfe LA, Hall P, Webb KA, Goodman L, Monga M, McGrath MJ. Prescription of aerobic exercise during pregnancy. Sports Med 1989 Nov;8(5):273-301&lt;/ref&gt; Capillaries to the womb and placenta carrying blood and therefore oxygen and nutrients to the foetus are therefore not efficient. Sufficient blood flow is needed to ‘feed’ the growing foetus. Complications here can result in poor growth, pre-term birth or even loss of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt;
=== Treatment ===
Women diagnosed with Gestational Hypertension and/or Preeclampsia require close monitoring of both maternal and foetal conditions. 
Management of gestational hypertension includes&lt;ref name=&quot;carpenter&quot;/&gt;:
* Bed Rest
* Blood Pressure Medications (anti-hypertensive drugs)
* Foetal and Maternal Monitoring (daily blood pressure readings)
* Hospitalisation (severe)
Commonly the mother’s blood pressure will return to normal within the first week postpartum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrazani&quot;&gt;Ferrazani S, DeCarolis S, Pomini F, Testa AC, Mastromarino C, Caruso A. The duration of hypertension in the puerperium of preeclamptic women: Relationship with renal impairment and week of delivery. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1994. 17:506–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  If blood pressure is still elevated, supplemented magnesium sulphate and antihypertensive drugs are given.&lt;ref name=&quot;seely&quot;/&gt; Daily blood pressure measurements are conducted, until there are no signs or symptoms of hypertension.

== Exercise Prescription for Gestational Hypertension ==
Current literature suggests that women with gestational hypertension need to limit physical activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;artal&quot;&gt;Artal, R., and M. O'Toole. &quot;Guidlines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for Exercise during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period.&quot; Br J Sports Med. 2003. 37, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) listed pregnancy induced hypertension in a list for absolute contraindications to aerobic exercise during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;acog&quot;&gt;ACOG Committee. Opinion no. 267: exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Obstet Gynecol 2002. 99,171–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature suggests that regular physical activity within the first 20 weeks of gestation may prevent or reduce the risk of developing Hypertension and related hypertensive disorders during the latter period of gestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;marcoux&quot;&gt;Marcoux S., Brisson J, Fabria J. The effect of leisure time physical activity on the risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. 1989. 43, 147-152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;saftlas&quot;&gt;Saftlas, A. F., N. Logsden-Sackett, W. Wang, R. Woolson, and M. B. Bracken. &quot;Work, Leisure-Time Physical Activity, and Risk of Preeclampsia and Gestational Hypertension.&quot; American Journal of Epidemiology. 2004 160(8), 758-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Hypertension and Exercise ====
Non aerobic-exercise such as yoga has been shown to decrease blood pressure in non-pregnant hypertensive patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt; It has been suggested this and other antenatal exercises could also reduce the risk of developing gestational hypertension along with aerobic exercise preconception.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt; Further research could be conducted into the effects of yoga and antenatal exercises on blood pressure in pregnant women to possibly predict the effects on pregnant hypertensive patients&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt;
==== Pregnancy and Exercise ====
Exercise should not involve ballistic movements or too much thermal/environmental stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;larsson&quot;&gt;Larsson L, Lindqvist PG. Low‐impact exercise during pregnancy–a study of safety. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 2005; 84(1):34-38.&lt;/ref&gt; As the gestational period continues, exercise intensity can decrease as long as physical activity is maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfe&quot;/&gt; Too much exercise or high intensity exercise causes skeletal muscle and the foetus to compete for blood flow and is related to pre-term births.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfe&quot;/&gt; Most studies predicted exercise intensity using % max heart rates varying depending on age and period of gestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;mottola&quot;&gt;Mottola MF, Davenport MH, Brun CR, Inglis SD, Charlesworth S, Sopper MM. VO2peak prediction and exercise prescription for pregnant women. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2006; 38(8):1389.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is important to note that in healthy individuals, exercise during pregnancy is considered beneficial to both mother and foetus, and is encouraged.  The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommend moderate intensity aerobic exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;pate&quot;&gt;Pate RR, Pratt M, Blair SN, et al. A recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine. AMA. 1995. 273, 402–7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exercise during pregnancy with non-hypertensive subjects not only reduces the risk of developing hypertension but has a number of other benefits including:
decreased adipose tissue accumulation associated with pregnancy due to increased sedentary activity,&lt;ref name=&quot;melzer&quot;&gt;Melzer K, Schutz Y, Boulvain M, Kayser B. Physical Activity and Pregnancy: Cardiovascular Adaptations, Recommendations and Pregnancy Outcomes. Sports Medicine 2010 06; 40(6):493-507.&lt;/ref&gt; decreased labour pain, decreased triglycerides and inflammatory cytokines, decreased insulin resistance, enhanced placental growth and vascularity, increase in plasma volume and cardiac output, reduction in emotional stress and anxiety &lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;larsson&quot;/&gt;

== Recommendations ==
* Exercising with Gestational Hypertension is not encouraged as it only increases blood pressure and can causes damage to mother and foetus
* Monitoring of blood pressure, rest and anti-hypertensive drugs are the main therapy for Gestational Hypertension
* Best strategy is prevention through light aerobic exercise pre-conception and most importantly, during 1st half of pregnancy
* Possible room for research into other coping strategies (non-aerobic exercise)
*Contact your physician/obstetrician and seek medical evaluation and clearance before undertaking any exercise regime

      <text xml:space="preserve">Obesity is a severe excess of body mass relative to lean mass and is commonly determined by interpreting an individuals  body mass index (BMI) &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot; &gt;Gaines, R., et al. (2009) The”O” Fator: A Review of the Literature and Strategies to Reduce Childhood Obesity. VAHPERD, 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;. It can be found by Dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meter’s squared. A BMI of equal or greater than 30 is considerd obese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot; &gt;Gaines, R., et al. (2009) The”O” Fator: A Review of the Literature and Strategies to Reduce Childhood Obesity. VAHPERD, 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found by Dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meter’s squared. A BMI of equal or greater than 30 is considerd obese.

=====BACKGROUND=====
Childhood Obesity has reached epidemic proportion, with approximately 22 million children aged under 5 considred obese worldwide &lt;ref name=&quot;Watts&quot; &gt;Watts,K., Jones,T., Davis,E &amp; Green,D. (2005) Exercise Training in Obese Childeren and Adolescents. Sports Med, 35(5),375-392.&lt;/ref&gt;. Childhood obesity is considered  a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is strongly correlated with the development of comorbid conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Insulin Resistance &lt;ref name=&quot;Ben-Sefer&quot; &gt;Ben-Sefer,E., Ben-Natan,M &amp; Ehrenfeld,M. (2009) Childhood ebesity: current literature, policy and implications for practise. International Nursing Review, 56, 166-173.&lt;/ref&gt;
The increase in fat mass in children has occurred concurrently with a decline in self-reported exercise time, with recent studies suggesting that obesity prevention should focus on increasing physical activity&lt;ref name=&quot;Watts&quot; &gt;Watts,K., Jones,T., Davis,E &amp; Green,D. (2005) Exercise Training in Obese Childeren and Adolescents. Sports Med, 35(5),375-392.&lt;/ref&gt; , to improve body composition and metabolic variables.

=====CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY=====
Although a range physiological and psychological factors contribute to childhood obesity,
weight gain is primarily caused by an imbalance between energy intake (calories consumed ) and energy expenditure (calories expanded) where energy intake exceeds expenditure&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben-Sefer&quot; &gt;Ben-Sefer,E., Ben-Natan,M &amp; Ehrenfeld,M. (2009) Childhood ebesity: current literature, policy and implications for practise. International Nursing Review, 56, 166-173.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the present time children are spending more time participating in sedentary behaviour and consuming more energy dense processed food &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot; &gt;Gaines, R., et al. (2009) The”O” Fator: A Review of the Literature and Strategies to Reduce Childhood Obesity. VAHPERD, 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to an  energy imbalance  swayed toward weight gain

=====ROLE OF EXERCISE IN REDUCING CHILDHOOD OBESITY=====
Exercise is a key component  in managing obesity. Physical activity increases energy expenditure improving energy balance towards weight loss. Exercise alone can also assist in the prevention of obesity related complications such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;Taplin&quot; &gt;Taplin,C.E &amp; Zeitler,P. (2009) Exercise for the treatment f childhood obesity- is it simply too much to ask? Foundation of Acta Paediatrica, 98, 214-216&lt;/ref&gt;.. Exercise increases self-confidence and self-esteem, the lack of which have been linked to obesity. 

=====EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS=====
The Australian Department of Health and Aging has developed Physical Activity recommendations for children and young people. These are that:
#Children and young people should participate in at least 60 minutes (and up to several hours) of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity every day.
#Children and young people should not spend more than 2 hours a day using electronic media for entertainment (eg computer games, Internet, TV), particularly during daylight hours.
It is also recommended that Overweight and Obese childeren - begin slowly working up to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity being sure to not over do it to cause injury, then increased to 60–90 minutes to avoid weight gain. &lt;ref name=&quot;Australian&quot;&gt;Australian Government Department of Health and Aging. (2007). Physical activity. Retrieved from http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-active-recommend.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is consistently feeling fearful and anxious at an unwarranted level. Although it is not known what is the direct cause it is associated with the amygdala and hippocampus of the brain, and elevated levels of norepinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric and serotonin in the brain, and trauma. If left untreated symptoms seem to become progressively worse.

'''Symptoms''' include difficulties with sleep, muscle tension, nausea, dizziness, excessive urination, restlessness, low concentration, sweating, and hot flushes&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

'''Risk factors''' include a family history of mental illness, stressful events or environments, long-term illness, and certain personality traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

'''Prevalence''' - The 2007 mental health survey showed anxiety disorders effected 14% of the Australian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;&gt; (2007). Anxiety Disorders in Australia. The Mental Health of Australians - Australian Government - Department of Health and Aging. (5)23-28 Retrieved from http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/46AB7A3FEF9664E4CA2575D2000A6D09/$File/mha25.pdf(viewed 18/10/12)&lt;/ref&gt; Females consistently showed higher rates than males in all age groups, especially in teenage years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt; GAD was responsible for 2.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt; Sufferers experienced the highest perceived interference of life, and higher psychological distress than many other anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt; 
In the UK 9% of the population had an anxiety disorder (less than Australia), while in the US 3.1% of the population had GAD (more than Australia).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler&quot;&gt;Kessler, R.C., Wai, T.C., Demlar, O., Walter, E.E.

Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2847357/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt;

'''Treatment''' through counselling can include cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.
Medical treatment includes antidepressants and benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

==Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Exercise==
It has been shown that '''levels of anxiety''' in patients with GAD and other anxiety disorders '''decrease with physical activity'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;
This is thought to be due to the increased presence of excitatory hormones and bodily responses at the time of exercise and the decreased influence they have with continued exercise, which may be due to down-regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

===Type of Exercise===
It is currently thought that '''aerobic exercise''' is best for reducing anxiety.
This may be due to adherence, or from the ability to maintain the exercise for a longer duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;&gt; (2010). Physical Activity Guidelines. Australian Government - Department of Health and Aging Retrieved from http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines(viewed 18/10/12)&lt;/ref&gt; Best results are seen with walking, jogging, riding and swimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;/&gt;

===Frequency===
It is recommended that the exercise is in sessions of '''20 minutes or longer'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; Australian government recommendations for physical activity for general health are '''30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every day''' if possible, which is a sufficient amount to reduce anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;/&gt; However, the recommendations also mention the possibility of breaking this time up in to '''10 or 15 minute sessions''', which '''may not be effective''' specifically for anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;/&gt; As with many physical improvements, the reductions in anxiety take some time, with best results occurring after '''ten weeks''' or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

===Benefits===
The sufferers of GAD report having problems with many aspects of their lives, in particular their social life. Participation in group fitness may help make the participant feel involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; With GAD concentration is also a problem, with exercise work and school lives could be improved as concentrating becomes easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; Exercise may also increase the ease of sleeping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt; The weight gains associated with taking antidepressants, can be managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

===Cautions===
Always make sure the participant is comfortable with the type of exercise, as you do not want to further anxieties.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; When taking antidepressants the side-effects of nausea, sweating, dizziness, and headaches may effect ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; With benzodiazepines, as well as the side-effects above they may have impaired motor coordination, blurry vision and tremors, which all mean greater precaution should be taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADF&quot;&gt; (2011). Benzodiazepines Druginfo - Australian Drug Foundation Retrieved from http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/benzodiazepines(viewed 18/10/12)&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms of GAD should always be taken into account when exercising.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; Always consult a general practitioner if you are unsure of your ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a form of anxiety disorder in which sufferers experience excessive and unnecessary anxiety and worry about regular occurrences in everyday life. In Australia, GAD affects approximately 3-6% of the population. GAD is most common during late teens to early twenties, and also in the elderly - as we have an ageing population, the number of people living with disorder may increase over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generalised Anxiety Disorder|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/GAD%20-%20AnxietyBC%20-%20GAD.pdf|publisher=Anxiety BC|accessdate=23/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAD is also more common in people of lower socio-economic status due to increased uncontrollable stressors. &lt;sub&gt; [1] &lt;/sub&gt;The onset of GAD can either be genetic, caused by prolonged stress, a traumatic experience or distorted beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=D.M|title=Anxiety Disorders: Why They Persist and How to Treat Them|journal=Journal of Behaviour Research and Therapy|year=1999|volume=37|pages=5–27| accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of anxiety can be classified as either mental (affecting the psyche) or somatic (affecting the body but excluding the psyche). Mental symptoms can be categorised as apprehension and vigilance, whilst somatic symptoms can be categorised as either motor-based or exaggerated physiological responses.

In order to meet diagnostic criteria for GAD, patients must suffer from persistent and uncontrollable apprehension, and the consequential somatic responses, for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kessler|first=R.C|title=Patterns and Correlates of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in Community Samples|url=http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i2/klinische/studium/literatur/587.pdf|accessdate=20/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comorbidities ==
GAD has a high comorbidity rate as many symptoms of GAD overlap with those of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression, bipolar and other forms of anxiety (namely social phobia and panic disorder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=N.M|title=Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Psychiatric Comorbidities such as Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Substance Abuse|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|year=2009|volume=70|pages=10–14|doi=10.4088/JCP.s.7002.02|accessdate=17/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 75-90% of GAD sufferers will also be diagnosed with one of the aforementioned psychiatric illnesses. &lt;sub&gt; [1] &lt;/sub&gt;

== Common Treatments ==
Common treatments for GAD include:
* Pharmacotherapy
* Cognitive behaviour therapy
* Hypnotherapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Renu|title=Hypononsis: Psycho-philosophical Perspectives and Therapeutic Evidence|year=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Dehli|isbn=13-978-81-8069-727-2|pages=207–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dietary modifications (elimination of caffeine and alcohol) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=R.N|title=Drugs Which Induce Anxiety: Caffeine|journal=New Zealand Journal of Psychology|year=1996|month=June|volume=25|issue=1|pages=36–42|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise can be used in conjunction with these treatments to help minimise the symptoms of GAD.

== Barriers to Exercise or Physical Activity ==
There are several factors that dictate the likelihood of a GAD patient adhering to an exercise regime:
* Interest in the activity
* Perception of physical activity and exercise (i.e. incidental physical activity)
* Motivation
* Fatigue
* Self-esteem
* Mind control

== Benefits of Exercise in GAD Patients==
* Endorphin release which masks pain, and produces feelings of euphoria and well-being &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harbor|first=VJ|title=Endorphins and Exercise|url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/6091217|publisher=Journal of Sports Medicine|accessdate=16/10/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress relief and clearing and calming of the mind
* Lowers resting heart rate - elevated heart rate is a symptom of GAD and exercise works to regulate this &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Diana|title=Anti-Anxiety Workout|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/anxiety-and-exercise.aspx|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lowers airway resistance which improves the breathing difficulties experienced by GAD sufferers
* Aids in alleviating muscle tension associated with GAD
* Improves concentration
* Provides a sense of self-mastery and changes in self-concept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strohle|first=A|title=Physical Activity, Exercise, Depression and Anxiety Disorders|journal=Biological Psychiatry|year=2009|pages=777–784|doi=10.1007/s00702-008-0092-x|url=http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Solutions_files/Physical%20activity,%20exercise,%20depression%20and%20anxiety%20disordrs.pdf|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling or swimming, are recommended as they are more successful than vigorous intensity-based programs. &lt;sub&gt; [10] &lt;/sub&gt;Exercising in social situations (for example, social tennis or dancing) is beneficial in two ways; the body undergoes the physiological adaptations associated with exercise, whilst also relieving emotional tension and improving self-value. Constantly elevated heart rate is a complication associated with GAD, however aerobic exercise improves the efficiency of the heart, thus lowering resting heart rate and helping to alleviate this symptom. &lt;sup&gt; [9] &lt;/sub&gt; Yoga is recommended, and, whilst is it not seen as an aerobic exercise, it 
calms the body, regulates breathing, and alleviates stress, whilst also stretching the muscles and strengthening the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nefer|first=B|title=Exercises for General Anxiety Disorder|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/129475-exercises-generalized-anxiety-disorder/|publisher=Live Strong|accessdate=23/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is recommended that patients partake in aerobic exercise 3-4 times per week, with a duration of 20 – 30 minutes per bout. The exercise program should continue for 8 –14 weeks to see overall improvements in their condition, but should be maintained for life. As well as exercise, incidental physical activity should be encouraged (for example, cleaning the house or climbing stairs) &lt;sub&gt; [10] &lt;/sub&gt;

== Further Research, Reading and Support ==
It is well-documented that there is a positive link between exercise and its role in preventing or lessening the burden of mental illness, however the clinical recommendations for exercise prescription are very general and limited. Future studies into standardising an exercise regime for GAD sufferers would be extremely beneficial in both prevention and treatment. &lt;sub&gt; [10] &lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Bézier 2 big.svg|200px|thumb|left|A smooth curve with control points P0, P1, and P2.]]
This tutorial discusses one way to render quadratic Bézier curves and splines in Unity. No shader programming is required since all the code is implemented in JavaScript.

There are many applications of smooth curves in computer graphics, in particular in animation and modeling. In a 3D game engine, one would usually use a tube-like mesh and deform it with vertex blending as discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Nonlinear Deformations}} instead of rendering curves; however, rendering curved lines instead of deformed meshes can offer a substantial performance advantage.

[[File:Bézier 1 big.gif|200px|thumb|right|A linear Bézier curve from P0 to P1 is equivalent to linear interpolation.]]
=== Linear Bézier Curves ===
The simplest Bézier curve is a linear Bézier curve &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 between two points &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, which happens to be the same as linear interpolation between the two points:

&lt;math&gt;B(t) = (1-t) P_0 + t P_1&lt;/math&gt;

You might be fancy and call &lt;math&gt;1-t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the Bernstein basis polynomials of degree 1, but it really is just linear interpolation.

[[File:Bezier quadratic anim.gif|200px|thumb|right|Animation of a sampling point on a quadratic Bézier curve with control points P0, P1, and P2.]]
=== Quadratic Bézier Curves ===
A more interesting Bézier curve is a quadratic Bézier curve &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 between two points &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; but influenced by a third point &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; in the middle. The definition is:

&lt;math&gt;B(t) = (1-t)^2 P_0 + 2(1-t)t P_1 + t^2 P_2&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a smooth curve &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; that starts (for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;) from position &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; in the direction to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; but then bends to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; (and reaches it for &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;).

In practice, one usually samples the interval from 0 to 1 at sufficiently many points, e.g. &lt;math&gt;B(0), B(0.05), B(0.1), B(0.15), B(0.2), ..., B(1)&lt;/math&gt; and then renders straight lines between these sample points.

===Curve Script===
To implement such a curve in Unity, we can use the Unity component [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt;]. Apart from setting some parameters, one should set the number of sample points on the curve with the function &lt;code&gt;SetVertexCount&lt;/code&gt;. Then the sample points have to be computed and set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. This is can be implemented this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (1.0 - t) * (1.0 - t) * p0 
         + 2.0 * (1.0 - t) * t * p1
         + t * t * p2;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we use an index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to &lt;code&gt;numberOfPoints-1&lt;/code&gt; to count the sample points. From this index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; a parameter &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to 1 is computed. The next line computes &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is then set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. 

The rest of the code just sets up the &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt; component and defines public variables that can be used to define the control points and some rendering features of the curve.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var start : GameObject;
public var middle : GameObject;
public var end : GameObject;

public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;
public var numberOfPoints : int = 20;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer || null == start 
      || null == middle || null == end)
   {
      return; // no points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &gt; 0)
   {
      lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints);
   }

   // set points of quadratic Bezier curve
   var p0 : Vector3 = start.transform.position;
   var p1 : Vector3 = middle.transform.position;
   var p2 : Vector3 = end.transform.position;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (1.0 - t) * (1.0 - t) * p0 
         + 2.0 * (1.0 - t) * t * p1
         + t * t * p2;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
To use this script '''create''' a '''Javascript''' in the '''Project''' view, double-click it, copy &amp; paste the code above, save it, create a new empty game object (in the main menu: '''GameObject &gt; Create Empty''') and attach the script (drag the script from the '''Project''' view over the empty game object in the '''Hierarchy''').

Then create three more empty game objects (or any other game objects) with different(!) positions that will serve as control points. Select the game object with the script and drag the other game objects into the slots '''Start''', '''Middle''', and '''End''' in the '''Inspector'''. This should render a curve from the game object specified as “Start” to the game object specified as “End” bending towards “Middle”.

[[File:Circle and quadratic bezier.svg|200px|thumb|right|A quadratic Bézier spline out of 8 quadratic Bézier curves.]]
=== Quadratic Bézier Splines ===
A quadratic Bézier Spline is just a continuous, smooth curve that consist of segments that are quadratic Bézier curves. If the control points of the curves were chosen arbitrarily, the spline would neither be continuous nor smooth; thus, the control points have to be chosen in particular ways.

One common way is to use a certain set of user-specified control points (green circles in the figure) as the &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; control points of the segments and to choose the center positions between two adjacent user-specified control points as the &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; control points (black rectangles in the figure). This actually guarantees that the spline is smooth (also in the mathematical sense that the tangent vector is continuous).

=== Spline Script ===
The following script implements this idea. For the j-th segment, it computes &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; as the average of the j-th and (j+1)-th user-specified control points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to the (j+1)-th user-specified control point, and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is the average of the (j+1)-th and (j+2)-th user-specified control points:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      p0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position);
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      p2 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position);
&lt;/source&gt;

Each individual segment is then just computed as a quadratic Bézier curve. The only adjustment is that all but the last segment should not reach &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;. If they did, the first sample position of the next segment would be at the same position which would be visible in the rendering. The complete script is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var controlPoints : GameObject[] = new GameObject[3];
public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer || controlPoints == null 
      || controlPoints.length &lt; 3)
   {
      return; // not enough points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &lt; 2)
   {
      numberOfPoints = 2;
   }
   lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints * 
      (controlPoints.length - 2));

   // loop over segments of spline
   var p0 : Vector3;
   var p1 : Vector3;
   var p2 : Vector3;
   for (var j : int = 0; j &lt; controlPoints.length - 2; j++)
   {
      // check control points
      if (controlPoints[j] == null || 
         controlPoints[j + 1] == null ||
         controlPoints[j + 2] == null)
      {
         return;  
      }
      // determine control points of segment
      p0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position);
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      p2 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position);
      
      // set points of quadratic Bezier curve
      var position : Vector3;
      var t : float; 
      var pointStep : float = 1.0 / numberOfPoints;
      if (j == controlPoints.length - 3)
      {
         pointStep = 1.0 / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
         // last point of last segment should reach p2
      }  
      for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
      {
         t = i * pointStep;
         position = (1.0 - t) * (1.0 - t) * p0 
            + 2.0 * (1.0 - t) * t * p1
            + t * t * p2;
         lineRenderer.SetPosition(i + j * numberOfPoints, 
            position);
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The script works in the same way as the script for Bézier curves except that the user can specify an arbitrary number of control points. For closed splines, the last two user-specified control points should be the same as the first two control points. For open splines that actually reach the end points, the first and last control point should be specified twice.

=== Summary ===
In this tutorial, we have looked at:
* the definition of linear and quadratic Bézier curves and quadratic Bézier splines
* implementations of quadratic Bézier curves and quadratic Bézier splines with Unity's LineRenderer component. 

===Further Reading===

If you want to know more 
* about Bézier curves (and Bézier splines), the Wikipedia article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve “Bézier curve”] provides a good starting point.
* about Unity's LineRenderer, you should read Unity's documentation of the class [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html LineRenderer].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Mexico=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1929. All stamps (except Type E2) are inscribed “CORREOS MEXICO” or “MEXICO CORREOS”.
* The stamps have a variety of numbers and prefixes: a meter number usually with “MAQ No” or “MAQ M” prefix, and a license or permit number, usually with “LIC No”, “PERM” or “PERM No” prefix. Often stamps show only one of these numbers rather than both a meter and a permit number.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and use:
:: A - Small upright rectangle with radiating lines at sides
:: B - Upright rectangle with internal frame lines but no ornaments
:: C - Open design with eagle between town mark and value box
:: D - Rectangle with single or double straight-line non-ornamental border
:: E - Open design without outer frame
:: F - Rectangle with elaborate ornamental border
:: G - Nearly square design with eagle and snake and cactus at right
:: H - Nearly square design with eagle man at right and cactus at left
:: I - Frank with simulated perforation border at top, bottom and left and with monument at right
:: PO – Digital stamps generated by machines in Post Offices

== Can I actually use this content... ==

Hi,

I am brand new to wikibooks and was just wondering if I can actually use the content found here and in the books to build my website if I attribute it properly and license the site appropriately?  [[User:Yosef Karo|Yosef Karo]] ([[User talk:Yosef Karo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yosef Karo|contribs]]) 10:04, 30 September 2012 (UTC)
:Yes, you can &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:11, 1 October 2012 (UTC)
== NEW BOOK? ==

I was wondering if a new book should be created called &quot;BEYOND BLENDER RENDER: A GUIDE TO THE BLENDER GAME ENGINE&quot;. I know about &quot;NOOB TO PRO&quot; but that is for an earlier version of Blender (2.49 I believe). This would be for 2.63 (a). [[User:Downdate|Downdate]] ([[User talk:Downdate|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Downdate|contribs]]) 16:36, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

:Would this be taking the existing content of Noob to Pro and simply updating it?  If so, then it might be better to simply update Noob to Pro and note any discussions that require a particular version to make use of, with [[Template:B3D:N2P/ForVersion]].  If it'd be drastically different, there are already several [[Subject:Blender 3D|books on Blender 3D]], so I don't see why you couldn't begin another, should you have an inclination to see it through.  Please see [[Help:Contents]] for tips on getting started. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:32, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

== Fundraising localization: volunteers from outside the USA needed ==

''Please translate for your local community''

Hello All,

The Wikimedia Foundation's Fundraising team have begun our 'User Experience' project, with the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries outside the USA and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. I am searching for volunteers to spend 30 minutes on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 

The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real-time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. ''All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed'' (and they will be low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)

By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. Please sing up and help us with our 'User Experience' project! :)
If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!

Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;

== Open textbook hacking ==

A few groups are doing great work producing open texts.  Siyavula is building them from scratch, Saylor Foundation is doing both de novo and compilation work, combining anything freely readable online.  Boundless is doing compilation work, combining freely-licensed texts. 

[[Siyavula]] focuses on K-12 books for South Africa.  They are amazing, but not all here on Wikibooks yet! 

The [[Saylor Foundation]] is compiling college texts in a number of fields, matching the core courses needed, from existing materials that are free to use (online or in educational purposes).   Again, they're not all here yet; I'm not sure they are all cc-sa compatible.  See their  [http://www.saylor.org/otc/ Open Textbook Challenge].

[[Boundless]] is doing the same thing, as a for-profit that hopes to add extra services on top of OER texts in the future.  They are starting a series of book hackathons to pull together existing open materials into more coherent books (say, of Light &amp; Matter quality).  cf. boundless.com

Finally, [[Light and Matter]] is the best single-author set of OER texts ever written; thanks to [[user:Bcrowell|Ben Crowell]].  Who also wrote a lot of [[Modern Greek]] :)  We should talk more with him about how to better support and replicate that work.

=== Physics textbook hackathon ===
A physics textbook booksprint is taking place in Boston (and online) Nov 2-4, hosted by Boundless.  You can rsvp to attend in person [http://www.eventbrite.com/orderstart?ebtv=C on eventbrite].    I'll be there along with some of the boston-area wikipedians and text-hackers.  Perhaps we could organize online remote hacking here on wikibooks?  Let me know if this sounds interesting.  Or if you have subject areasd you'd like to see such a hackathon cover: the topic scope is yet to be decided.  Clearly we should expand and improve on what Light and Matter already offer [again, not all entirely replicated here on WB!] [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 01:07, 19 October 2012 (UTC)
== Information systems in the consumer industry ==

Hello, there's a new book [[Information systems in the consumer industry]] authored by user [[user:Fmiotto|Fmiotto]] and splitted by me into multiple chapters. Any review is welcome. I am a newbie on en.wikibooks, sorry if I have done anything wrong. --[[User:LoStrangolatore|LoStrangolatore]] ([[User talk:LoStrangolatore|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LoStrangolatore|contribs]]) 13:22, 21 October 2012 (UTC)
== Android ==

Hi folks. I've been contributing to the book [[Android]] for a while, adding a chapter on testing, but I'm wanting to edit some of the rest of it now, and  the user [[user:Fishpi]] who seems to have started the book doesn't have a user page... so has presumably vanished. Is it acceptable protocol for me to take the book over and expand the bits that aren't mine, like Wikipedia? I'd prefer to collude with Fishpi.

I'm also confused about who's reviewing the text and setting the quality 'minimal' - makes it sound like I'm not doing a very good job. :)

[[User:SleekWeasel|SleekWeasel]] ([[User talk:SleekWeasel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SleekWeasel|contribs]]) 10:49, 22 October 2012 (UTC)

: Hi!

: Fishpi has been around moderately recently; see [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi]].

: To check for lurking past contributors to a book before &quot;adopting&quot; it for '''major''' changes, it's common to put an inquiry on the book's main talk page saying what you have in mind and asking for advice/help/etc.  In this case, that would be [[Talk:Android]].  Also, if there is a more-or-less-single author one can also inquire at their user talk page, in this case [[User talk:Fishpi]].  Depending on how extreme the change is going to be, one '''''might''''' wait as much as a week before proceeding, but it really does depend on the whole context of the situation, like how &quot;big&quot; the change you have in mind is.  It looks like there's a related chapter, [[Using Wikibooks/Contributing To An Existing Wikibook]], in the Featured Book [[Using Wikibooks]].

: Our textbooks are collaborative; so don't be shy about helping out with them, ''especially'' if what you have in mind really isn't destructive to the content or organization of what's already there.  You seem to be very respectful of past contribution to the book, so I suspect you'll be fine.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:00, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
== Improving communication between your wiki and &quot;tech people&quot; ==

Hi. I'm posting this as part of my job for the WMF, where I currently work on technical communications.

As you'll probably agree, communication between Wikipedia contributors and &quot;tech people&quot; (primarily MediaWiki developers, but also designers and other engineers) hasn't always been ideal. In recent years, Wikimedia employees have made efforts to become more transparent, for example by writing [[mw:Category:Wikimedia engineering reports|monthly activity reports]], by providing [[mw:Wikimedia Features engineering|hubs listing current activities]], and by maintaining &quot;[[mw:VisualEditor|activity pages]]&quot; for each significant activity. Furthermore, the [[mw:Wikimedia Engineering/2012-13 Goals|yearly engineering goals]] for the WMF were developed publicly, and the more granular [[:mw:Roadmap|Roadmap]] is updated weekly.

Now, that's all well and such, but what I'd rather like to discuss is how we can better engage in true collaboration and 2-way discussion, not just reports and announcements. It's easy to post a link to a new feature that's already been implemented, and tell users &quot;Please provide feedback!&quot;. It's much more difficult to truly collaborate every step of the way, from the early planning to deployment.

Some &quot;big&quot; tech projects sponsored by the WMF are lucky enough to have [[w:User:Okeyes (WMF)|Oliver Keyes]] who can spend a lot of time discussing with editors, basically incarnating this 2-way communication channel between users and engineering staff. But Oliver can only do so much: he has to focus on a handful of features, and primarily discusses with the English Wikipedia community. We want to be able to do this for dozens of engineering projects with hundreds of wikis, in many languages, and truly collaborate to build new features together. Hiring hundreds of Community Liaisons isn't really a viable option.

There are probably things in the way we do tech stuff (e.g. new software features and deployments) that drive you insane. You probably have lots of ideas about what the ideal situation should be, and how to get there: What can the developer community (staff and volunteers) do to get there? (in the short term, medium term, long term?) What can users do to get there?

I certainly don't claim to have all the answers, and I can't do a proper job to improve things without your help. So please help me help make your lives easier, and speak up.

This is intended to be a very open discussion. Unapologetic complaining is fine; suggestions are also welcome. Stock of ponies is limited. [[User:Guillom|guillom]] ([[User talk:Guillom|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Guillom|contribs]]) 14:40, 23 October 2012 (UTC)

:I would suggest having a central page that summarizes requests for the inclusion of extensions and the reasons for not including these extensions.

::That's a really nice idea, thanks for bringing this up. It's the first time I've heard this suggestion; I'll make a note of it.

== University professor concerned about the use of plagiarism detection tools ==

I am a professor at a university in Washington State.  My concern is how to detect plagiarism in university papers.  I have discovered a clever pattern my MBA students are using to avoid detection of their use of plagiarism (such as from Wikipedia). After cobbling together content (direct and indirect quotations) from various sources,  the students use a plagiarism detection tool to identify which parts of their paper need to be modified to avoid detection of lack of any attribution.  

I discovered that the student used without attribution a Log Normal Probability density function on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution that has the caption:  &quot;Some log-normal density functions with identical location parameter μ but differing scale parameters.&quot;

I very much need your help in identifying the unattributed source for the following description (of the above log-normal distribution).

For example:  “Figure 6, presented below, illustrates several log-normal distribution shapes as an example of how distributions can vary widely depending on the nature of the process.  Looking at the highly skewed example, it is easy to see how an assumption of normality could greatly under-predict defect rates in the direction counter to the skew.”

:I'm not a lawyer...
:Using content for specific articles from Wikipedia is not a clear cut copyright infringement, since encyclopedic articles do not get copyright protection, only the aggregate work (collection). It still would constitute plagiarism (claiming other people work) in some of the more complex articles (some do go beyond being simple encyclopedic articles) but it would be disputable if they have any creative content, since the objective is to report facts.
:Note that images have their own copyright and some do require direct attribution. Tables and data collections do not have copyright protection unless they go beyond factual information and use creative content or reflect the result of some specific work (for example statistics and not absolutes, having a table without providing source information would serve no purpose).
:In the example you provide the first part is a simple description and the second part would not constitute a copyright infringement alone. It depends on the scale of the used content from the same source that has been used to create the new work.
:Plagiarism is not strictly linked to copyright infringement (it relates well but is not the same), most institutions have their own clear definition of what constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism is about the morality of an action that may even not be illegal.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:06, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

:This is a very useful essay on Wikipedia - [[w:Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing|Close Paraphrasing]]. It contains advice on how to detect plagiarism, even if the words have been changed. It isn't something that is easy to do though. However, for an expert in the field (which I presume you are) it should be relatively easy to list down the articles and sources a student is likely to have plagiarised and then use the structural tests. With a little practice you'll find before too long that you can spot a problem very quickly. Taken from that essay ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing&amp;oldid=513774396 attribution]:

* Look for disjointed and sudden changes in the tone, vocabulary, and style of content introduced by the same contributor. For example, &quot;The cat is a small predatory carnivorous species of crepuscular mammal. Housecats like to kill mice and bats.&quot;
* Look for redundant content; this may be a sign that two or more sources were closely paraphrased. For example, &quot;The cat is a small predatory carnivorous species of crepuscular mammal. Like many pets, domestic cats are carnivorous.&quot;
* Look for content that resembles content included in a quotation.
* Examine the talk pages of major contributors and other pages where they have written in their own words, and determine if their article contributions substantially differ in tone, structure, and vocabulary from these discussions.
* Take short phrases from the article and put them in a search engine. Take a look at the results and see if they closely resemble the article.

== Installing [[mw:Extension:SubpageSortkey|Extension:SubpageSortkey]] ==

Hi!

After the recent review of the [[mw:Extension:SubpageSortkey|Extension:SubpageSortkey]], it is finally ready to be deployed on Wikibooks project(s), to improve the categorization system as described on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2010/June#DefaultSortkey for namespaces with subpages]].

Per [[bugzilla:22911#c30|Sumana's comment]] on our request, all we need is to confirm we still want that feature. From [[bugzilla:22911#c11|comment 11]], the configuration here on English Wikibooks would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;php&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;
$wgSubpageSortkeyByNamespace[NS_MAIN] = '1..';
$wgSubpageSortkeyByNamespace[102] = '1..'; // Cookbook
$wgSubpageSortkeyByNamespace[110] = '1..'; // Wikijunior
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Maybe also something else, since [[Template:BookCat]] has a #switch depending on namespace which seems to change the sortkey in other specific cases...

So, can it be installed with this configuration? If necessary, please take a look at the [[mw:Extension:SubpageSortkey#Usage|documentation]] to suggest an improved configuration. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 14:37, 25 July 2012 (UTC)

:The switch disables categorizing on discussion pages and files templates into a special category name and also files that special book-specific template category into the book's category.  The actual sort key value does not change unless you specify {{para|filing|deep}}.  The 1.. value seems to be quite fine to me, allowing the use of simple &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; code to reduce the barrier to entry for newcomers and even allow for a bit better performance on the wiki. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:10, 26 July 2012 (UTC)

[[File:Finite difference spline example.png|200px|thumb|left|A Hermite spline that interpolates smoothly between pairs of control points.]]
This tutorial discusses Hermite curves (more exactly: cubic Hermite curves) and Catmull-Rom splines in Unity. The latter are a special kind of cubic Hermite splines. No shader programming is required since all the code is implemented in JavaScript.

Some splines (for example the quadratic Bézier spline discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Bézier Curves}}) don't go through all control points, i.e. they don't interpolate between them. Hermite splines, on the other hand, can be defined such that they go through all control points. This is a useful feature in many applications, e.g. in animation where it is often important to set specific values for particular key frames and let tools smoothly interpolate further values for inbetweens.

[[File:Hermite spline 2-segments.svg|200px|thumb|right|Two Hermite curves. The first curve goes from p0 to p1 with tangent m0 at p0 and tangent m1 at p1.]]
=== Hermite Curves ===
A single cubic Hermite curve &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 is defined by a start point &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; with tangent &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; and an end point &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; with tangent &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;H(t) = (2t^3-3t^2+1) P_0 + (t^3-2t^2+t) M_0 + (-2t^3+3t^2) P_1 +(t^3-t^2) M_1&lt;/math&gt;

The curve starts (for &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;) at &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; in direction of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; and then changes course to direction &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and reaches &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t = 1&lt;/math&gt;. As the figure illustrates, two Hermite curves can be smoothly attached to each other by choosing the same tangent vector for the corresponding end points. 

===Curve Script===
To implement such a curve in Unity, we can use the Unity component [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt;]. Apart from setting some parameters, one should set the number of sample points on the curve with the function &lt;code&gt;SetVertexCount&lt;/code&gt;. Then the sample points have to be computed and set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. This is can be implemented this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (2.0*t*t*t - 3.0*t*t + 1.0) * p0  
         + (t*t*t - 2.0*t*t + t) * m0
         + (-2.0*t*t*t + 3.0*t*t) * p1
         + (t*t*t - t*t) * m1;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we use an index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to &lt;code&gt;numberOfPoints-1&lt;/code&gt; to count the sample points. From this index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; a parameter &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to 1 is computed. The next line computes &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is then set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. 

The rest of the code just sets up the &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt; component and defines public variables that can be used to define the control points and some rendering features of the curve.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var start : GameObject;
public var startTangentPoint : GameObject;
public var end : GameObject;
public var endTangentPoint : GameObject;

public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;
public var numberOfPoints : int = 20;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer 
      || null == start || null == startTangentPoint
      || null == end || null == endTangentPoint)
   {
      return; // no points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &gt; 0)
   {
      lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints);
   }

   // set points of Hermite curve
   var p0 : Vector3 = start.transform.position;
   var p1 : Vector3 = end.transform.position;
   var m0 : Vector3 = startTangentPoint.transform.position 
      - start.transform.position;
   var m1 : Vector3 = endTangentPoint.transform.position
      - end.transform.position;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (2.0*t*t*t - 3.0*t*t + 1.0) * p0  
         + (t*t*t - 2.0*t*t + t) * m0
         + (-2.0*t*t*t + 3.0*t*t) * p1
         + (t*t*t - t*t) * m1;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
To use this script '''create''' a '''Javascript''' in the '''Project''' view, double-click it, copy &amp; paste the code above, save it, create a new empty game object (in the main menu: '''GameObject &gt; Create Empty''') and attach the script (drag the script from the '''Project''' view over the empty game object in the '''Hierarchy''').

Then create four more empty game objects (or any other game objects) with different(!) positions that will serve as control points. Select the game object with the script and drag the other game objects into the slots '''Start''', '''StartTangentPoint''' (for the end point of a tangent starting in the start point), '''End''', and '''EndTangentPoint''' in the '''Inspector'''. This should render a Hermite curve from the game object specified as “Start” to the game object specified as “End”.

[[File:Catmull-rom-tangent.svg|200px|thumb|right|Computation of tangents in Catmull-Rom splines.]]
=== Catmull-Rom Splines ===
A cubic Hermite spline consists of a continuous, smooth sequence of cubic Hermite curves. In order to guarantee smoothness, the tangent at the end point of one Hermite curve is the same as the tangent of the start point of the next Hermite curve. In some cases, users provide these tangents (one for each control point), in other cases, however, appropriate tangents have to be computed. 

One specific way of computing a tangent vector &lt;math&gt;m_k&lt;/math&gt; for the k-th control point &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is this:

&lt;math&gt;m_k = \frac{p_{k+1} - p_{k-1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;m_k = p_{k+1} - p_{k}&lt;/math&gt; for the first point and &lt;math&gt;m_k = p_{k} - p_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; for the last point. The resulting cubic Hermite spline is called Catmull-Rom spline.

=== Spline Script ===
The following script implements this idea. For the j-th segment, it computes &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; as the j-th control point &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;p_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;(p_{j+1} - p_{j-1})/2&lt;/math&gt; (unless it is the tangent of the first control point, in which case it is set to &lt;math&gt;p_{j+1} - p_{j}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;(p_{j+2} - p_{j})/2&lt;/math&gt; (unless it is the tangent of the last control point, then it is set to &lt;math&gt;p_{j+1} - p_{j}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      p0 = controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      if (j &gt; 0) 
      {
         m0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j - 1].transform.position);
      }
      else
      {
         m0 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }
      if (j &lt; controlPoints.length - 2)
      {
         m1 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position);
      }
      else
      {
         m1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }   &lt;/source&gt;

Each individual segment is then just computed as a cubic Hermite curve. The only adjustment is that all but the last segment should not reach &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. If they did, the first sample position of the next segment would be at the same position which would be visible in the rendering. The complete script is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var controlPoints : GameObject[] = new GameObject[3];
public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;
public var numberOfPoints : int = 20;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer || controlPoints == null 
      || controlPoints.length &lt; 2)
   {
      return; // not enough points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &lt; 2)
   {
      numberOfPoints = 2;
   }
   lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints * 
      (controlPoints.length - 1));

   // loop over segments of spline
   var p0 : Vector3;
   var p1 : Vector3;
   var m0 : Vector3;
   var m1 : Vector3;
   for (var j : int = 0; j &lt; controlPoints.length - 1; j++)
   {
      // check control points
      if (controlPoints[j] == null || 
         controlPoints[j + 1] == null ||
         (j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; controlPoints[j - 1] == null) ||
         (j &lt; controlPoints.length - 2 &amp;&amp; 
         controlPoints[j + 2] == null))
      {
         return;  
      }
      // determine control points of segment
      p0 = controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      if (j &gt; 0) 
      {
         m0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j - 1].transform.position);
      }
      else
      {
         m0 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }
      if (j &lt; controlPoints.length - 2)
      {
         m1 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position);
      }
      else
      {
         m1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }   
      
      // set points of Hermite curve
      var position : Vector3;
      var t : float; 
      var pointStep : float = 1.0 / numberOfPoints;
      if (j == controlPoints.length - 2)
      {
         pointStep = 1.0 / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
         // last point of last segment should reach p1
      }  
      for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
      {
         t = i * pointStep;
         position = (2.0*t*t*t - 3.0*t*t + 1.0) * p0  
            + (t*t*t - 2.0*t*t + t) * m0
            + (-2.0*t*t*t + 3.0*t*t) * p1
            + (t*t*t - t*t) * m1;
         lineRenderer.SetPosition(i + j * numberOfPoints, 
            position);
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The script works in the same way as the script for Hermite curves except that the user can specify an arbitrary number of control points and doesn't have to specify tangent points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are having trouble make a connection between the WifiLapper app and Pitside over Wifi, here are a few tips.

== Check the Wifidots ==
First things first you'll need to make sure the phone is in range of the router. This can done by opening pitside and loading the Database corresponds to the sessions you were having issues in. In the example below you can see that both Wifi Dots channels logged something during a lap. This indicates that the phone was &quot;seeing&quot; the selected Wifi Network. As you can see, the connection was available for a while (about 15 seconds).

== Making Changes ==
Depending on the Android phone model, the Wifi connection interval can be set anywhere from 2 to 90 seconds from the factory. We can edit these parameters to speed up the connection time of WifiLapper to Pitside. The phone will need to be rooted to make this change. Beware that rooting your phone may void your Warranty or violate your wireless carrier contract. If you don't know how to root your phone, Google it. Be warned if something isn't done right during the rooting process, damage can be done to the phone. It's pretty hard to hurt Android phones, or &quot;brick it&quot; in hacking terms, but anything is possibly in experimental hacking. Users have reported getting it wrong 5 times on a phone while attempting to root it, but no physical harm was done to the device. As always, your mileage may vary. Consider this prior warning.

After the phone has been rooted, use [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.fm File Manager] to gain access to the &quot;build.prop&quot; file. Start by opening the File Manager app and open the setting menu, scroll to the bottom and enable Root Explorer and Mount System Folders.



Use the Up button to get to the root folder (usually 2 taps)



Find the &quot;system&quot; folder, click it



You should now see the build.prop file in the current folder



Tap and Hold on the file until the following menu comes up



Tap Permissions

Make a note of how the File Permissions are set before making any changes. You will want to set them back to this when we are finished editing.

Enable Read, Write and Execute permissions for all 3 groups to allow the file to be edited. They may not all have to be enabled but it always works this way



Close the menu and tap &quot;build.prop&quot;

Choose &quot;Open as Text&quot;



Be careful while in here, changes may break stuff** Now find the line that reads &quot;wifi.supplicant_scan_interval=&quot;.  This is how many seconds between attempts to connect to a known WiFi Network.  Some phones are set to 90 seconds. For typical lap times at most race tracks, that means the window of connection opportunity is very limited. The WifiLapper team recommends setting the wifi.supplicant_scan_interval to 2 seconds.

Make sure you Save the changes when you exit. It is also a good idea to return the &quot;build.prop&quot; file permissions to how they were originally found to prevent any accidental changes in the future.



Reboot the phone. The changes don't take effect until rebooted. Run some test laps at safe speeds around your neighborhood to verify WiFi connection to Pitside.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Flip Classrooms&lt;ref&gt;www.wilkes.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Part I
Flip Classrooms
Trend hypothesis: 
 The trend of flipping classroom is when the teacher substitutes in-class instruction with at home video instruction and utilizes class time for homework assignments and other project based learning activities.  Several concepts support this style of teaching.  First space will be freed up during in-class time to allow for more just in time instruction and activities in smaller groups enabling the instructor to conduct inquiry-based learning.  Another concept of a flipped classroom is it integrates technology into learning and reinforces the classroom time to discussion and collaboration which reinforces the learning process. 
Description of Trend :
 Flipping a classroom is gaining a lot of momentum in teaching.  Professor Eric Mazur tested this style of instruction back in the 1990’s at Harvard.  Salmen Khan has generated over 2200 videos used for the purpose of educating.   He has created the Khan Academy which utilizes this trend.  The idea is that students learn the lesson at home through videos and other technologies.  In class instruction is spent doing homework assignments and inquiry based projects.  This type of teaching is a form of blended learning which incorporates technology with face to face learning.  
Khan Academy has revolutionized this type of teaching.  They have recently developed a software program which teaches math and are working on incorporating into other subject areas.  The initial learning of the lessons occurs at home through videos.  This gives students the opportunity to learn at their own pace.  If a student doesn’t understand a concept they are able to rewind the video and replay to review the concept and better understand.  For students that do not have computers alternative locations are available.  
Khan Academy provides teachers with a dashboard which enables teachers to monitor student progress.  Teachers can track individual student progress and progress as a whole class.  Teachers can monitor time spent on specific topics by individual students.   When teachers notice specific students are struggling with a topic or problem they are able to work one on one or in small groups to conduct a mini workshop.  While working with those struggling students the remainder of the class is able to continue to work on other activities or project based learning.  This type of teaching allows instructors to use their time more effectively with students.   This concept takes passivity out of the classroom and the teacher becomes more of a coach or a mentor as oppose to a lecturer.  
Flip Classroom is a constructivist approach to learning.
Constructivism is a theory of learning which allows a person to understand meaning through individual successions.  This trend of flipping the classroom incorporates this theory into practice.  Students learn through activities and project based learning after they have developed an understanding based on lessons they watched prior to class time.  Students learn assigned lessons prior to scheduled class time.  Students learn at their own pace through videos and/or other technological resources.  This type of learning provides the student with the opportunity to learn information at a pace that is conducive to their learning needs.   Students in a flip classroom are able to take what they have learned at home and apply it in a classroom setting through inquiry based projects and assignments. Teachers are able to provide just in time instruction based on student’s understanding, knowledge, and needs.  Students apply their understanding of the assigned lesson from the night before and demonstrate through projects and activities in class.  
This style of learning applies Lev Vygotsky zone of proximal development (ZPD).  ZPD is the range of tasks that are too difficult for a child to master alone but can be learned with guidance and assistance of adults or more skilled children. The lower limit of the ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently, whereas the upper limit is the level of additional responsibility the child can accept with the assistance of the  instructor.  A student in a flip classroom applies this style of learning into his work by taking what he learns and demonstrates through a level of independence in the assignment.  If the student falls at the lower limit of the zone of proximal development the instructor is there to assist him.  Flip classrooms can be a great facilitator in developing student understanding and collaboration. 
Flip Classrooms and traditional instructional design models
Robert Gagne is a behaviorist who identified nine events of instruction.  His first event is to gain the attention of the learner.  In a flip classroom this can be accomplished through the teacher video.  As with any lesson it is important to “hook” the student’s interest so they will listen or watch what is being presented.  In a flip classroom there is more opportunity for teachers to be creative in grabbing a student’s interest.  The next event Gagne identifies is to inform the leaner of the objective.  This can successfully be accomplished in a flip classroom environment because teachers have the ability to incorporate in the video repetition as it relates to the objective.  By repeating what the students will be learning it provides reminders to what they are learning which in turn reinforces the goal(s) of the lesson, what they are expected to accomplish, and how they will be able to use the information.  Step three of Gagne’s events of instruction is to recall prior knowledge.  In a flip classroom environment the teacher will be able to incorporate recall of prior knowledge within the video the student will watch.  It can also be reinforced the day before as the assignment is being give.  In the lesson the teacher develops she will provide scaffolding techniques to stimulate this recollection.  In a flip classroom a teacher has the ability to be repetitive which further reinforces to this third event.  A teacher will also be able to provide additional detail, hints, information, concept, etc. to further stimulate the student’s memory.  Part of the at home assignment can include concept maps which will help learners to remember prior knowledge along with new knowledge being generated.  This will help the student “chunk” new information which is Gagne’s fourth event in his instructional model.  Events five through nine are reinforced during the in class activities and assignments.  Gagne’s nine steps can be modeled in a flip classroom because ultimately the goal in this style of learning is to provide more hands on time with the teacher directing the students.  This way of teaching helps students when they are incorporating new information and developing new ideas.  This way of teaching and thinking falls in line with Bloom’s Taxonomy creating, evaluating, and analyzing learning domains.
Shortcomings of traditional instructional software 
Aaron Sams (2011) in his article Setting the flip straight explains in a brief format the history of this concept.  There have been many versions of flip classrooms which have been around for several years.  For example, screencasting model or vodcasting.  It is important to remember that the Khan Academy, screencasting, or other models are not to be a substitute for an actual course.  These styles of learning do not replace the role of a live teacher. Many opponents to technology and blended learning believe that this style of educating is not a logical curriculum of study.  They believe it does not engage students at all the cerebral platforms in which a student needs in order to master subjects and successfully learn.  
Sams stated, “Khan Academy is great for learning about lots of different subjects. But it’s not really adequate for learning those subjects on a level that really makes a difference in the world” (Sams, 2011, retrieved from http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-shedding-light-on-the-confusion-critique-and-hype-801.php).   He believes for knowledge to occur it takes more than “watching videos (or lectures) and doing exercises. It takes hard work (by both the learner and the instructor)” (Sams, 2011, retrieved fromhttp://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-shedding-light-on-the-confusion-critique-and-hype-801.php).
	In order for successful uses of technology in the classroom, as that required by flip classrooms it does require teachers to be prepared.  This requires professional development geared towards preparing teachers to use technology.  Harold Wenglinsky (1998) conducted a national study  of technology’s impact on mathematic achievement.  The findings showed when computers were used students in fourth and eighth grade achieved academic success in mathematics. 
Seymour Papert and Idit Harel (1991) have initiated the learning by design model to educational technology by having the student be the designer and creator of such software.  This places the student as the developer of programs for other students to learn.   Seymour Papert defines constructionism as &quot;Giving children good things to do so that they can learn by doing much better than they could before.&quot; (retrieved from http://www.papert.org/articles/const_inst/const_inst1.html)

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food| local food] movement has mobilized many in support of its cause. Participants in this social movement are often called [http://locavores.com locavores], a term coined in 2005 for World Environment Day and named the Oxford American Dictionary word of the year in 2007.

This article seeks to examine the local food movement through social movement criteria developed by Eyerman and Jamison in 1991&lt;ref&gt;Eyerman, R., &amp; Jamison, A. (1991). Social Movements: A Cognitive Approach. Penn State Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The four criterion are the creation of a mission, the use of technology, the dissemination of new technology, and the creation of new roles.

==Creation of a Mission==
This refers to the formation of common ground among the members of the movement. The mission becomes the overarching goal of the movement and acts as the foundation for the participants. 

===History===
Agriculture has always played a significant role in America’s economy. Initially, farms were family owned and produce was locally distributed. Western expansion and the implementation of railroad systems allowed the number of farms to triple from 1860 to 1905. With expansion and new technology came national distribution. Trucks and Trains now made it possible for people in Maine to eat peppers from Texas, people from Oregon to get cotton from Virginia, etc. This national trade allowed family farms to prosper. During the Great Depression, Roosevelt’s New Deal established many programs to help aid family farms and ensure continued prosperity. However, in the early 1970s, Earl Butz, Nixon’s secretary of agriculture, began to reengineer many programs established by the New Deal. He established new programs in hopes of driving down the cost of food, advertising slogans such as “get big or get out” and “from fencerow to fencerow”. Federal agriculture policy also shifted to include subsidies for commodity crops.&lt;ref&gt;Philpott, T. (2008, February 8). A reflection on the lasting legacy of 1970s USDA Secretary Earl Butz. Retrieved December 5, 2013, from Grist website: http://grist.org/article/the-butz-stops-here/ &lt;/ref&gt;   This lowered food prices and caused farmers to need increased yields to remain profitable. This led to deep depression in the farm belt followed by a brutal wave of consolidation. Large food manufacturers began to dominate the market, causing a greater separation between the public and their food.&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, M. (2010, June 10). The Food Movement, Rising. The New York Review of Books. www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/food-movement-rising/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, the majority of the public was unaware of the negative side effects of retrieving produce from distant, large food manufacturers. However, in the early 2000s, individuals began writing books and blogs about the difference between local and distant food. One book in particular, “Coming Home to Eat” by Gary Paul Nabham, inspired what many argue to be the beginning of the “Local Food Movement”.&lt;ref&gt;Trimarchi, M. (n.d.). What are locavores? Retrieved December 5, 2013, from TLC website:       http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/locavore1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

After reading Nabham’s book, four Californian women (Sage Van Wing, Jessica Prentice, Dede Sampson, and Lia McKinney) lead a challenge to eat from within a 100 mile radius for one month. Jessica Prentice created the name “locavore” to help their challenge gain awareness. She saw this word as a way to convey the concept of “eating not only from your place, but with a sense of place” .&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, I. (2013, June 29). A local food revolution. Retrieved December 29, 2013, from Journal: A       Close Look at Sustainability website: http://journal.snodemo.com/showcase/2013/06/29/a-local-food-revolution/ &lt;/ref&gt; This word and movement began to gain popularity as it caused people to become more conscious of where their food what coming from and how it was produced. Soon several movements arose and united to form what is known today as the local food movement.

===Definition===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food &lt;u&gt;Local food&lt;/u&gt;] is produced in close proximity to consumers. &quot;Local&quot; can be based on a marketing relationship (i.e., that producers sell directly to consumers), or a geographical relationship. Although locavores initially popularized the &quot;100-mile Radius&quot;, the USDA acknowledges a 400 mile radius as a true boundary of what can be called geographical &quot;local&quot; food.&lt;ref&gt; Martinez, Steve et al. (2010) Consumer demand for food that is locally produced, marketed, and consumed is generating, Local Food Systems: Concepts, Impacts, and Issues. Economic Research Service Report Summary, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locavore &lt;u&gt;locavore&lt;/u&gt;] is a person who eats locally grown foods whenever possible. The term was created in 2001 as a way to convey the concept of “eating not only from your place, but with a sense of place”.&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, I. (2013, June 29). A local food revolution. Retrieved December 29, 2013, from Journal: A Close Look at Sustainability website: http://journal.snodemo.com/showcase/2013/06/29/a-local-food-revolution/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer Motivations for Buying Local===

&lt;u&gt;Relationships:&lt;/u&gt; Local food establishes connections between consumers and producers that supermarkets are not able to provide. Organizations such as farmer’s markets and road-side stands allow the consumer to buy produce directly from the farmer. This enables the consumer to question production methods and promotes a personal relationship between farmer and consumer. On the other hand, supermarket food typically travels around 1,500 miles before reaching the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Pirog, R., &amp; Benjamin, A. (2003). Checking the food odometer: Comparing food miles for local versus conventional produce sales to Iowa institutions. Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, Ames, Iowa, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This generally creates an impartial and impersonal experience for the consumer.

&lt;u&gt;Health and Taste:&lt;/u&gt; Supermarket food usually contains preservatives, while local food generally has no added chemicals, comes directly from the farmer, and often tastes fresher.&lt;ref&gt;Assessment, E. I. (2007). Analysis of Food Sustainability at the University of Kansas, Lawrence Campus. www.sustainability.ku.edu/Documents/Student_Projects/615/Food_Sustainability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Environment:&lt;/u&gt; Local food addresses environmental concerns as a less energy-intensive alternative. Agricultural systems (processing, transportation, pre-washing, etc) consume about 1/5 of the total petroleum used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, M. (2010, June 10). The Food Movement, Rising. The New York Review of Books. www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/food-movement-rising/&lt;/ref&gt; Local food is generally not packaged, travels fewer food-miles, and doesn't require as much processing.

&lt;u&gt;Community:&lt;/u&gt; The average American farmer receives about $0.20 for each dollar they spend. Since 1979, the United States has lost around 300,000 farmers to debt. By buying directly from farmers, participants in the local food movement help farmers remain financially viable by retaining higher profits.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, G. W., &amp; Ikerd, J. (1993). Sustainable Agriculture: A Twenty-First-Century System. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 529, 92–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Animal Welfare:&lt;/u&gt; Large food manufacturers typically manipulate the quality of life of their animals to maximize their food-producing potential while local farmers use more human methods such as “free-range” and “grass-fed”.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Animal Welfare at Tufts. (n.d.). Retrieved December 5, 2013, from Feast website: http://www.tufts.edu/programs/feast/animalwelfare.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===

Local food is rapidly becoming more accessible to consumers. In 2013, 8,144 farmers markets were listed in the U.S. (a 3.6% increase from 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Farmers Markets and Local Food Marketing. (2013, August 3). Retrieved December 5, 2013, from USDA       website: http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateS&amp;leftNav=WholesaleandFarmersMarkets&amp;page=WFMFarmersMarketGrowth&amp;description=Farmers%20Market%20Growth%5D &lt;/ref&gt;  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture Community-supported agriculture], which involves purchasing “shares” of local farmer’s produce, is another way consumers are able to easily obtain local food. Local food can also be found through intermediaries such as restaurants, retail grocery stores and government institutions like hospitals and farm-to school programs. 

===Advocates and Opponents===
The local food movement can be framed by its advocates and opponents. 

Advocates of the local food movement range from individuals to large organizations. At the heart of the local food movement lies individual bloggers and writers who spread the importance of this movement. This has inspired many organizations to be created, ranging from small farmers markets to large groups such as [http://www.communityfoodadvocates.org/blog/ Community Food Advocates] and the [http://www.slowfoodusa.org/ Slow Food Movement]. Recently, select restaurants and grocery stores, such as Chipotle, Walmart, and Whole Foods, have become major advocates by selling almost exclusively local produce. The government has also recently become an advocate by establishing the “Farm-to-School” program. 

Major opponents of the local food movement include companies with financial stakes in the food production market. This can include large farms, and food conglomerates like [http://occupybigfood.wordpress.com/ Monsanto]. According to some analyses, transportation of local food is more inefficient; cross-specialization (i.e., large farms dedicated solely to one crop) would allow more food to be distributed to a growing population. &lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Steve. (2011). The Inefficiency of Local Food. www.freakonomics.com&lt;/ref&gt; Although local food proponents argue that producing food locally decreases transportation costs, a recent study found that 11% of energy costs are from transportation while 83% of the energy expended is from production, which can be less efficient at smaller family farms. &lt;ref&gt;Weber, CL &amp; Matthews, HS. Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42, 3508–3513&lt;/ref&gt; If food is being produced locally, it will reduce business from international producers, who may depend on exports for profit. &lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, J &amp; Vorley, B. (2006) &quot;Fair Miles? The concept of “food miles”  through a sustainable development lens.&quot; IIED.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Locavores and Social Stigma===
Locavores are often portrayed as elitists. They are commonly viewed as a pretentious group that eats more expensive food because they can. However, a 6 state study found that when examining comparable items, farmers markets are less expensive than nearby supermarkets 74% of the time.

Locavores can be subdivided into four main categories: the environmentally concerned, the animal welfare activists, the health concerned, and the participants who prefer the freshness and taste of local foods. Participants feel that they can support the local food movement by 'voting with their food dollar' and buying local for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The San Fransisco activists, who coined the term locavore, describe themselves as &quot;concerned culinary adventurers.&quot; They portray themselves as environmentalists, embracing the frontier of dietary practice and eschewing the normalcy of traditional consumption. They seek to appear both bold and exciting so that others will join their cause.

==Use of Technology==
This includes the creation of new technologies, both systematic and technical, for use within the movement.

===New Technologies===
Two technologies developed in response to the movement are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytunnel hoop houses] and vertical [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics hydroponics]. Hoop houses are highly customizable alternatives to greenhouses, allowing small farmers to economically and efficiently remain competitive. Vertical hydroponics allows for the high density vertical growth of fruits and vegetables.  Hydroponics is a system of nourishing plants without the use of traditional soil.  Naturally, plants receive nutrients through the breaking down of nutrients through the soil in which their roots are fixed in, but in a hydroponic system, those same plants are receiving their nutrients through artificially nourished water, eliminating the use of traditional soil fields and allowing farmers to maximize space in a green house or hoop house. Using this system, farmers can reap larger crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;http://greengrotech.com/news/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Distribution Systems===
Local food producers have diversified their distribution systems. For example, [http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/locally-grown Whole Foods] has shifted emphasis from organic to local foods. They spotlight local producers. Wal-Mart was the first supermarket to sell local food at its chains. Safeway, Kroger, and other supermarkets have followed suit. &lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Stephanie. (2010). Wal-Mart to Buy Local Produce. The New York Times. www.nytimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of these systems has not only raises awareness, but also increases the prevalence of organizations that serve as middlemen between small producers and large consumers.

====Food Cooperatives====

Another form of distribution system that has emerged from the local food movement is the popularization of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_cooperative food cooperatives].  These cooperatives serve as distribution centers for small local farmers who join together and practice [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_economics cooperative economics].  Each farmer contributes what he or she can to the reserves of food and is rewarded by gaining access to the entire source of food, while the surplus is then sold off to the public to cover cost associated with managing production and distribution.  This is a simple way for small farmers to support each other in their endeavor to provide locally grown organic food to their families and town.  Examples of food cooperatives that have grown psat their local roots are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_O%27Lakes Land O'Lakes], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggly_Wiggly_Alabama Piggly Wiggly], etc.  The importance of food cooperatives in sustaining local food markets can be seen globally by the United Nations declaration that 2012 was the &quot;International Year of Cooperatives &lt;ref&gt;http://social.un.org/coopsyear/&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Food cooperatives exist under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles Rochdale Principles], which state that they cannot exclude anyone from participating if he or she is able, and must cooperate with other cooperatives, among other principles.  Given this inclusion and open mindedness inherent to all food cooperatives, they have been able to thrive in even the most competitive local markets against large whole sale food providers.  In the Charlottesville area alone there are 4 separate entities that identify themselves as food cooperatives &lt;ref&gt;www.horseandbuggyproduce.com&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/firsthandfarmerscooperative&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;www.friendlycityfoodcoop.com&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;heartlandharvestfarm.com/buyingclubs.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Dissemination of Information==
A social movement needs to develop means of communication like the internet, advertisements, spoken word, pamphlets, etc.

===Communication within the Local Food Movement===
Farmers act as teachers, spreading information about unusual products, new recipes and interesting production processes. Chefs, like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Puck Wolfgang Puck], can be advocates for local food by making their menu from marketplaces, and advertising on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;S. Inwood, J. Sharp, R. Moore, D. Stinner, Restaurants, chefs and local foods: insights drawn from application of a diffusion of innovation framework, Agriculture and Human Values. 26 (2009) 177–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Food magazines and newspapers often frame the movement in terms of child nutrition, food safety, and obesity, while individual blogs and articles focus also on the environmental benefits of eating locally through personal experiences and challenges. Ad hoc social institutions including farmers conventions, underground locavore restaurants, and local food councils also proliferate information within the movement.&lt;ref&gt; A. Starr, Local Food: A Social Movement?, Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies. 10 (2010) 479–490.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and Popular Media===
According to a recent study published in the Journal of Extension, mass media tends to frame the local food movement positively, using emotionally-laden keywords like &quot;accessibility&quot;, &quot;variety&quot;, &quot;sustainable&quot;, &quot;safe&quot;, and &quot;cost-savings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth-McSwain, A. Eating Green: Coverage of the Locavore Movement. Journal of Extension: October 2012 // Volume 50 // Number 5 // 5FEA7&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Occupy&quot;-esque movements and the Buy Fresh, Buy Local organization post propaganda through blogs, Twitter, and public events. Public figures like Michelle Obama also endorse the local food movement, garnering support from the general public. For example, the First Lady started an organic garden at the White House, and attends the White House Farmer's Market. The Food Network has also recently begun promoting local foods by including local ingredients in series like &quot;Chopped&quot; and &quot;Iron Chef&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Food Network. http://www.foodnetwork.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of New Roles==
New roles can be formal or informal. They may include public officials, spokespersons, entrepreneurs, writers, activists, etc.

Roles created as a result of the local food movement include [http://www.charlottesville.org/index.aspx?page=757 farmers market managers], custom smaller slaughterhouses for small cattle operations, local food policy councils, farming restaurant owners and journalists reporting on local food, such as Food Inc or the book The Omnivores Dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, A. (2010). Local Food: A Social Movement? Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies, 10(6), 479–490.&lt;/ref&gt; Will Richey, owner of [http://revolutionarysoup.com/ Revolutionary Soup] in Charlottesville, is an example of a farming restaurant owner. His small farm in Esmont, Va supplies much of the dairy and poultry for his restaurant.

==Charlottesville: A Case Study==

===Origins to Today===
The local farming community has been a staple of central Virginia and Charlottesville since the area was first settled. A visit to [http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/attending-to-my-farm Monticello] will reveal how deeply rooted farming is in the history of Charlottesville. Thomas Jefferson’s gardens were used as both a means for sustenance as well as science. Jefferson experimented with over 70 different species from various geographic origins including beans brought back from Lewis and Clark’s expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Monticello. &quot;Attending to My Farm.&quot; http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/attending-to-my-farm&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson’s unquenchable thirst for innovation is instilled in the culture of Charlottesville, which is apparent in the inventive techniques being used by local farmers for growing a diverse range of produce and distributors for reaching a broad range of local consumers. 

The city boasts [http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/things-to-do/orchards-and-farms/ scenic family-run farms], orchards, wineries, breweries, and restaurants as great attractions for visitors and residents alike. While tourism is a key revenue stream for some of the orchards and vineyards in Charlottesville, most farmers’ livelihoods rely on their produce and livestock. They can compete with corporate farms’ low costs better when [http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/index.cfm/1,3,0,0,html/Why-Buy-Local consumers place increased value] on freshness, local economic benefits, and knowledge of food history. 

The [http://www.charlottesvillecitymarket.com/ Charlottesville City Market], the largest outdoor market in Charlottesville, opened in 1973 and became a platform for local farmers and artisans to interact directly with the Charlottesville consumers. However, in 2009, the [http://localfoodhub.org/ Local Food Hub] began its mission to broaden consumer access to Charlottesville’s local food. 

Charlottesville farmers’ ability to produce a wide range of produce combined with the Local Food Hub’s model for local food distribution has led to great momentum in the Charlottesville local food movement. These two accomplishments were only possible because of Charlottesville consumers’ demand for local food.

===Diversity of Farmer Specialization===
Agriculture occupies 37% of the land in Virginia where there are over 47,000 individual farms making it the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia#Economy largest industry in Virginia].&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. &quot;Virginia Economy.&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia#Economy&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of these farms have specialized in cash crops such as tomatoes, soy, hay, and tobacco, some farms in Charlottesville and other areas are attempting to cover a wider range of produce. In order for the local food movement to gain traction, the local farms need to produce a diverse range of produce in order to satisfy consumer choices.
 
Michael Clark, the owner and farmer of [http://www.planetearthdiversified.com/ Planet Earth Diversified] in Charlottesville, has used his technical proficiency to produce micro-greens for consumers with very particular tastes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-ville.com/beyond-organic-local-farmer-michael-clarks-produce-thrives-despite-growing-pains/&lt;/ref&gt; Clark came to the University of Virginia in 1975 to study electrical engineering. He ended up using his engineering expertise to open a small farm that uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics hydroponic] growing techniques and a self-built automated heating and cooling system. Clark has built relationships with local restaurateurs who have a high demand for his flavor loaded specialty produce, micro-greens. More than [http://localfoodhub.org/our-food/where-to-find-our-food/ 30 restaurants in Charlottesville] pride themselves on using local ingredients. They are only able to do this when local growers can supply them with the various ingredients that they need.

===Broadening Distribution Channels===
While Charlottesville restaurants and consumers have emphasized local food for many years, the [http://localfoodhub.org/ Local Food Hub], which opened in 2009, increased the Charlottesville farmer’s access to consumers immensely. This is the Local Food Hub’s [http://localfoodhub.org/about/mission/ mission]: “[We are] a nonprofit organization working to improve small farm viability and increase community access to local food.” Rather than limiting access to the Saturday [http://www.charlottesvillecitymarket.com/ City Market], restaurants, and specialty markets, the Local Food Hub has opened up Charlottesville farmers’ distribution channels to include schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and retailers. 

Distribution of perishable items, such as fresh produce and meats, requires large capital costs such as refrigerated warehouses and trucks. While these costs are too large for most local farmers, the Local Food Hub combines the distribution of [http://localfoodhub.org/about/mission/ over 70 local farms’] fresh food in order to provide a link to more than 150 locations. According to the [http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/15/local-food-hub-brings-it-all-together/ US Department of Agriculture], “It’s clear that Local Food Hub is doing more than just aggregation and distribution. In less than two years it’s emerged as a model for fostering long-term sustainable development and community engagement through agriculture.”&lt;ref&gt; US Department of Agriculture. http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/15/local-food-hub-brings-it-all-together/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer Support===
The success of Local Food Hub would not have been possible without the support of Charlottesville’s residents. When the non-profit first started in 2009, it needed to purchase refrigerated warehouse space and trucks. Turning to the residents of Charlottesville, Local Food Hub found its funding through donations.&lt;ref&gt;USDA. &quot;Local Food Hub Brings it all Together&quot; http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/15/local-food-hub-brings-it-all-together/&lt;/ref&gt; This was not only an important funding milestone for Local Food Hub, but also an indication that there was significant demand for increased access to local food from the residents of Charlottesville. Even the best-designed systems cannot gain social momentum unless there is community support. One way the Charlottesville local food advocates were able to gain community support was through access to information. Buy Fresh Buy Local is a non-profit that sends out semi-annual newsletters to 67,000 Charlottesville area residents promoting local food.&lt;ref&gt;Buy Fresh Buy Local http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The newsletters contain propaganda about the benefits of buying local, advertisements for different local farms, and information on where to buy different types of local food. These newsletters, festivals that promote local artisans and farmers, and the [http://www.charlottesvillecitymarket.com City Market] all helped the local food advocates gain community support.&lt;ref&gt;Charlottesville Festivals http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/calendar-of-events/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrap Up===
Buy Fresh Buy Local was the first organized group to solely support the cause of buying local food in the Charlottesville area.&lt;ref&gt;Buy Fresh Buy Local. http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/&lt;/ref&gt; They garnered community support through information propagation in their semi-annual newsletters. This dissemination of information allowed for Local Food Hub to create a community supported distribution system with a mission to broaden consumer access to local food. They had to create a new role in which they combined the resources of over 70 farms in the Charlottesville area. Through this new role, Local Food Hub was able to shift the distribution power in favor of the local farms. This mission would not have been possible without innovative farmers’ abilities to use technology in ways that allow for a diverse range of produce that satisfy consumer taste.

==Conclusions==
Displeased with major changes in the food industry, small food movements combined to form the larger local food movement. Similar dissatisfactions have led to other social movements, such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street Occupy Wall Street] movement, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade Fair-trade movement], and the emergence of [http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CS2/index.php Lou's List] at the University of Virginia. Lou's list arose in 2006 as a result of dissatisfaction with ISIS, the old online information system at UVa. Because of frustrations with SIS (ISIS's replacement), students and professors found a new way to plan their schedules. Social causes arise as a result of common desires and dissatisfaction. They become movements when they create a mission, new technologies, new roles, and a means of propagating information.

In the case of 'information: 
* it is the transmission of a message from a sender to a receiver; the content of the message refers to &quot;objective&quot; facts and it codified independently from the human relationship between the informer and the informed..
* the whole message is codified through a conventional system of sign and composition rules.
* the message is sent intentionally by the sender who expects an obtainable results.

&lt;br /&gt;

In the case of communication: 
* it is a bi-directional sequence of transmission of messages where the counterparts are both &quot;senders and receivers&quot;; 
* the meaning of these messages can be understood only in the context of the actual interaction of the communicators. 
* besides the message codified through a &quot;conventional&quot; language the communicating actors send also a series of message codified &quot;naturally&quot;  (e.g. body language) that clarify the relational content of the human relationship between the counterparts: viz. the tone of the voice, the rhythm of the sentence, the physical postures, etc. constitute clusters of information that acorganization the linguistic messages and propose an interpretation modality of the relationship. 
* not all messages are transmitted consciously (body may speak differently from what we expect); 
* the results of communication can be pre-planned by the actors before the communication is undertaken, because results depend on the other's choices; (e.g. the voice can reveal anxiety and may prompt unexpected results of hostility, etc.)

Communication always involves at least two persons (or two groups of persons) who, while talking about &quot;something&quot; also define their relationship and the reciprocal expectations.
Usually when the communication &quot;fails&quot; it is not because of disagreement about &quot;what&quot; the two are talking about, but rather because they do not agree on the relationship model proposed by the counterpart.

! The relational content of communication
|-
| [[File:The relational content of communication.jpg]]
|-
|&lt;small&gt;Every communication has the purpose of establishing a relationship. Relationships are basically of three orders: the equal (between friends) and hierarchical relationship on both sides: adult-child and child-adult. There are also relationships, for instance, between man and woman thatmove through all three orders of relationships in different phases and different moments.   Human relationships are established if both accept the identification of the degree of relationship proposed by the other. In our case, for instance, I’m the father and you’re the child- I’m teaching and you’re learning. We accept this. The moment one of the students reacts and the teacher perceives that he is refused as a teacher, there is tension between the two until, for instance, the teacher realises that in that particular subject matter it is the student who knows more. So, I accept the other as the teacher (for instance, when you put doubts on the hardware list). The elasticity or the capacity of persons to accept changes in the levels of the relationship at different points is extremely important for the relationship.  Even if we consider language to be different from communication, we must always consider the hierarchical relationship as an essential purpose of the fact of communicating. We communicate in order to establish the level of the relationship and only after we’ve established it. This again is a problem of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/Punctualization|punctualization]].&lt;/small&gt;
|}

When we communicate we also tell to to the counterpart how we portray our relationship: as superior, inferior or as equal. And the other does the same. We feel comfortable  if the counterpart con organization our interpretation (he/she acts as inferior while we proposed us as superior, etc.); we feel uncomfortable if the counterpart refuses our interpretation and proposes one that we think it is unacceptable ( (e-g- both the counterparts wants to be considered as reciprocally superior).

Another factor of uneasiness can be the modality of interpreting and otherwise established hierarchy:  the hierarchical order is established as functional to the achievement of specific objectives or is it expression of a natural superiority/inferiority amongst the persons?

In any case the reciprocal definition of roles is never static: the constant redefinition or reiteration of the relationship represent the axis upon which interpersonal communication moves.  Along with the processes of communication therefore, are constantly redefined the spheres of competence, the sectors where one is superiors to the other are better defined, it is better understood how much there are common stakes and common interests and how much interests are diverging or become effective.
So we can say that communication is the process through which social ties are established   and that there is no community (or society) without group identity: this identity is formed when communication achieves its objective 

The objective of communication is achieved when a group of &quot;I&quot;s accept to identify themselves as a &quot;we&quot; (with a common purpose and common stakes). 

For most of the time the communication about the relationship is not explicit.  Most of the time in communication is spent referring to to the &quot;objective&quot; world (beyond their relationship). So  reciprocal interpersonal intentions are clarified implicitly, by the way people communicates and relates to each other.
Only rarely messages refers explicitly to the human relationship. In fact to communicate about &quot;things&quot; is easier then communicating about &quot;relationships&quot;. In order to be explicit about the relationship one need a higher level of intimacy.

Technically to communicate about the relationship is considered a way of &quot;communicating about communication&quot; :   that is why it is defined as &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/Meta-communication|meta-communication]] &quot;.
It is important to realize that in each human relationship we can find elements of solidarity and elements of  competition.  

In fact each indivisual is at the same time in a communion of interests with the other in the organization of the economical and cultural structure of the social system where she lives and work; and in competition with the others in the effort of getting for herself as many good things produced by this system. Along this dynamics various smaller social units are generated, that are also at the same time in solidarity and in competition amongst themsellves, and produce various forms of unions and alliances. Along this dynamic of simultaneus solidarity¾competition are formed varius levels of social aggregation.   

Technically we call competition the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#the zero sum game|zero sum]] and solidarity the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#the positive sum game|positive sum]] in [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games|social gaming]].

Communication is what allows us to manage the reciprocal conflict of interests maintaining the bound of solidarity for the achievement of the shared objectives.

| Competition || Zero sum game || Every advantage obtained on the one side corresponds to an equal disadvantage on the other side|| price fixing in a negotiation
|-
| Solidarity || Positive sum game || The player have a common interest at stake: they can be either both winner or both losers || the relationship physician-patient in the therapy
|}




Communication is never an objective in itself, but it is always a means to produce an effect, that according to the three modalities of human relationship that we identified can be 

*increase the power of the protagonist by generating persuasion in the target audience; 
*allow the counterpart to make informed choices by providing knowledge of facts and intentions; 
*educate so that the counterpart can extend her/his horizon of possible choices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The varieties of social games
In order to understand all the implications of the difference between didactical communication and advertisement we have to keep in mind the two levels upon which human beings interact. 
In each social game, there is some solidarity and some competition. A mixture of the two is required to keep any group socially alive. But the rules of competition are different from the rules of solidarity. In order to understand it, we need to look at the game theory and understand the difference between the zero-sum game and the positive-sum games.

== The zero sum game ==
For instance football. For every goal I score, I subtract one goal from the other team. If I make a 3-0 score, it’s equivalent to our team making 0 and the other –3. Every point that I make is a point taken from the others. So, the zero sum game implies that whatever I gain is taken from the other’s asset and vice versa.
Another example could be of the price of a house on sale. Let’s say that you are selling and I’m buying the house. Let’s assume that the original price of the house is $50,000. If I’m able to buy the house for $49,000, I gain $1000 and you lose $1000 and vice versa. Discussion about the price is a zero-sum game. A war between two countries too is a zero sum game. The more of your soldiers I kill, the more I gain and the more effective is my destruction. If the destruction made by both sides is equal, it’s a zero sum. If I have destroyed more than the other side, I gain and it is no longer a zero sum game. So long as I lose what you earn or vice versa, it’s a zero sum.
 

== The positive sum game ==
It implies that we both gain or we both lose. If two countries do project/programme purpose, there’s a possibility that both benefit out of it. Even in the example of the house, the discussion of the price is a zero sum game but both buying and selling is a positive sum game. Why? Because you are finally more interested in the money I’m giving than in the house you’re selling and I’m more interested in the purchase I’m making than in the money I’m giving. So both have profited and so in the overall, it’s a positive sum game. In a team, for instance, it’s a positive sum game because if we win, we all gain. If we work together in such a way as to win, we all benefit from it. Within the team, it’s a positive game. In many levels, both these games work simultaneously. Like in a husband- wife relationship. There are some situations in which it is a zero sum but on the overall it’s a positive sum game- either both lose or both win. So in each relationship, there’s solidarity as well as competition. This is also present in a producer- action sponsor/beneficiary relationship- the zero sum game being the money to be paid and the work to be got out of it and the positive sum game is in the fact that both want a good product that finally has a good follow-up. Since we have a common purpose, we will find the right price for producing the product. Another relationship is that of the owner with the managers, where, in a training initiative, the incompetent managers can be fired and so lose while owners gain. On the other hand, increase in the productivity of the organization would benefit everybody and this would be a positive sum game.

Development cooperation is done at its best when the partners have a common interest at stake, when they all are going to benefit from the development process and when they are together analyzing the problems, setting the objectives and are working together to  produce the expected changes. This requires a healthy [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|communication climate]] where  the interests of all partners are integrated so as to achieve a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#The positive sum game|positive-sum relation]].

* '''Information''':  When we want to be as impersonal as possible, where what really matters is the &quot;objective&quot; content of the communication and the human relationship amongst the actors is not considered important (and not made explicit). 
* '''Education''': When the communication is a service given to the beneficiaries, with the objective of enlarging three horizon of possibilities and choices .
&lt;br /&gt;

In a gratifying human relationship the counterparts are able to shift roles and change the amongst these three fundamental modalities in order to better achieve their objective and reinforce their social identity.

However each one of these modality has  its own adequate methodology;  the approach that can be considered [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/The efficacy of communication dependent upon only one of its mode|adequate]] in one modality may be counterproductive in the other modality.

Communication is never an objective in itself, but it is always a means to produce an effect, that according to the three modalities of human relationship that we identified can be:
* increase the power of  the protagonist by generating persuasion in the target audience; 
* allow the counterpart to make informed choices by providing knowledge of facts and intentions;
* educate so that the counterpart can extend her/his horizon of possible choices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An important pre-requisite for an efficacious communication activity is to visualise properly which one of the three major varieties of communication represents our priority.
In fact the approach that can be considered adequate in one modality may be counterproductive in the other modality.
* Propaganda has to &quot;win over&quot; the resistance of the counterpart and therefore it requires &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;strategies&quot;. Victory is achieved when persuasion is achieved. The method of persuasion is the &quot;rhetoric&quot;: it is of two kinds: the friendly and the hostile.  Therefore success is based upon seduction and/or threats.
* Information has to be  &quot;objective&quot;, i.e. it has to furnish to the counterpart with adequate knowledge for aware choices.  The one who delivers the information should present herself as &quot;neutral&quot; with respect to the choices that the counterpart will do. 
* Education has to be &quot;maieutic&quot;,  i.e. has to help the counterpart to develop her personality according to what she values most. To educate is to help the person to develop her faculties and to express her individuality. In order to become education, communication primarily has to built a sense of respect and trust in the community that the learner considers as its own.
&lt;br /&gt;

The efficacy of communication dependent upon only one of its modalities: either seducing or objective, or self-revealing.

==Introduction==

This design study is part of the Human Expansion (HE) program conceptual design.  One of the HE program goals is to expand civilization into more difficult locations, while at the same time improving levels of technology and quality of life.  The goal in this study is to establish location parameter ranges for where people live now, and then from that derive what difficult and extreme ranges would be for future locations.  We set the middle 90% of where people live now as the existing range for each parameter, with 5% living at each extreme.  The middle 90% is described as '''Temperate''', and levels more than 10 and 20% beyond the Temperate range we call '''Difficult''' and '''Extreme''' respectively. 

The study will be performed in two parts.  The first part will make make initial estimates so that other parts of the HE program design can start to use the information.  The second part will survey where people live in more detail and generate improved values.  The HE program as a whole is using the start of 2013 as a baseline to reference against.  The '''[http://www.census.gov/population/popclockworld.html US Census Bureau]''' projects population at the start of 2013 to be 7,062 million, thus 5% is 353 million.  The more detailed population analysis will draw from world statistical data.

==Initial Estimates==

Seven environment parameters and four time and distance parameters were chosen in the HE Requirements Analysis to determine what makes a difficult or extreme location. In the list of the parameters that follows, we first define what the parameter is, then discuss how we make our estimate for the 90% Temperate Range.  We also discuss what the practical limits on Earth are for the Extreme ranges.  Once the practical limits on Earth are reached, or they exceed what is found in space, more difficult locations in space are used.

===Environment Temperature===

'''Definition''' - On Earth, this is the winter daily air temperature lows, and summer daily highs in Kelvin and (Celsius). For space locations this is the equilibrium temperature of a 50% gray body with one side facing the Sun and the opposite side facing away.

'''Estimate''' - On inspection of a world map, many more people live in far north locations than far south.  Northern Europe, Russia, parts of Tibet, Northern China, and Canada may supply 350 million cold climate residents.  Many people live in equatorial/hot climates, but the extremes are seen in dry climates where water vapor does not moderate daily temperature ranges. We make a rough estimate of 260 K (-13 C) as average January daily lows and 310 K (37 C) as average July daily highs as the limits of the Temperate range.

'''Limits''' - Ten percent, or 25-30K, beyond the temperate limits is a significant range for human climate, so Earth locations are likely to to have only one or two very cold and no hot difficult surface climates.  Deep underground might reach extreme hot levels in certain locations.

===Water Supply===

'''Definition''' - This is fresh water supply from rain and snow fall, flows from rivers and ice, and air moisture in meters depth/location area/year.  Since the density of fresh water is 1 ton/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, this is equivalent to tons/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Salt water does not count as fresh water supply, although evaporation does.  Underground aquifers that represents flows from rain or water transport count, but not amounts merely drawn from storage, since that is not sustainable.  Many people live near rivers, which supply high fresh water flows.  We count available river flow distributed over the local land area, so a high range location above that may be difficult to find.  Dry locations with low water flow are common.

'''Estimate''' - We use values of 0.25 and 2.5 meters on Earth as the Temperate range based on rainfall definitions of desert and wet climates.  This needs more support from climate data.

'''Limits''' -  On Earth, the lowest rainfall location, the Atacama Desert receives an average of 0.001 meters of rainfall/year.  We can get an upper estimate by assuming the Amazon River flow of 200,000 cubic meters/second is allocated to the nearest 10% of the drainage basin to the main river and tributaries.  Given a total area of 7 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that gives a water supply of 9 meters per year.  The highest rainfall locations give about 11 meters/year.  So we will adopt 10 meters/year as the extreme upper value.  Space locations would range from essentially zero in the inner Solar System, to moderate when significant numbers of ice or hydrated bodies pass within reach, to very high for ice-covered satellites or bodies.

===Atmosphere Pressure===

'''Definition''' - The average location gas pressure in kPa.  

'''Estimate''' - On Earth nearly everyone lives in a fairly narrow range of pressures.  We will assume for now the nominal range is from 80 to 100 kPa (sea level to 2000 m altitude).  

'''Limits''' - On Earth the lowest surface pressure is presumed to be at the highest point, Mt. Everest, at +8,850 m elevation.  The highest pressure is presumed to be at the bottom of the LaRonde Gold mine in Quebec, which reaches 3 km below a surface elevation of 300 m, for a net height of -2,700 m.  The pressure range is thus from 31.5 to 138 kPa. To go beyond these limits would require artificial structures, or ambient pressure underwater locations.  In space, local pressure can range from complete vacuum to many times Earth values on Venus or the Gas Giants.

===Ground Pressure===

'''Definition''' - On bodies with gravity this is the foundation design load in MPa or exterior water or rock pressure for below surface locations. In both cases this amounts to a boundary pressure on location structures.  Low range would be surface water structures or swamps, and high range would be tall buildings or below surface locations.

'''Estimate''' - We make a rough estimate of the Temperate range by referring to allowable soil bearing pressures from soft clay up to hard bedrock.  Dropping extreme values, these give a range from to 0.25 to 2.0 MPa.

'''Limits''' - For low range limit, we can assume a shallow boat or raft foundation with a depth of 1 meter or less.  This gives a load of 0.01 MPa. For high range limits, assuming a floor + dead load of 1000 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per floor, a 100 story skyscraper might impose a bearing pressure of 1 MPa on the foundation base.  Practical limits on tall construction have more to do with economics than with structural materials, so taller buildings are possible.  

Since the depths of the ocean and deep underground can reach very extreme pressures and temperatures, we set a practical limit based on the energy to reach Earth orbit (31.3 MJ/kg) compared to the column of mass which must be displaced to access such deep locations. For a 1 kg volume of ocean, which has a mass of ~1 kg, displacing a column 800 m high requires raising 8000 kg x 400 m avg height x 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 31.3 MJ.  For continental crust, which has a density of 2.7kg/liter, a 1 kg volume then is 7.2 x 7.2 cm.  Each meter of rock above this area then is then 13.925 kg.  A column 675 m deep then masses 9400 kg, and raising it an average of 337.5 m also yields 31.3 MJ/kg.  Therefore we will consider the practical limits to be ocean depths to 800 meters and continental depths to 675 m, after which we start including space locations. Other parameters may drive us to space before depth does.  The corresponding water and rock pressures are 8 and 18 MPa respectively. 

===Energy Supply=== 

'''Definition''' - Flux from natural sources in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  On Earth this will mostly be from solar and wind, with water flow and geothermal in some locations.

'''Estimate''' - On Earth, average solar flux ranges from 100 to 300 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; after accounting for night, clouds, and sun angle.  Wind power in the US ranges from below 100 to over 1000 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hydroelectric, tidal and sea currents, and geothermal are localized, so we will ignore them for this first estimate.  Combining wind and solar we get a rough estimate of 150 to 900 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as the temperate range.  In space, solar flux is 1366 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Earth's distance, times the percentage time in sunlight.

'''Limits''' - Any significant water or ground depth will have near zero energy supply.  Peak Earth values might be at high altitudes where a combination of high winds and increased sunlight would supply high power levels.  In space, peak energy level will vary dramatically with distance from the Sun.

===Gravity Level===

'''Definition''' - Local gravity level in meters/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Space locations near large objects still has a gravity level, even though orbits may create free-fall conditions with low relative forces between system elements.  

'''Estimate''' - The Earth's surface, where almost everyone lives, is entirely within 10% of the 9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; standard value.

'''Limits''' - Values more than 10% outside the Temperate range require extremely tall structures ( &gt; 320 km tall ), or orbital locations.  Thus this parameter is effectively fixed for Earth locations.  Solar system locations can range from zero to about 200 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; very close to the Sun.

===Radiation Dose===

'''Definition''' - Human radiation exposure in an unprotected state from background radiation, in milliSievert/year.  It should be noted that in many locations humans cannot survive in an unprotected state, but for consistency the exposure level is measured that way.  In addition to background radiation, humans also get significant exposure from medical and other human-made sources, but that is not location-specific, so is not counted as part of this location parameter.  

'''Estimate''' - Most of the Earth's population lives in a relatively low radiation environment, but higher altitudes or high natural radioactivity areas exist.  Data derived from a UN report indicate the typical range is from 1-13 mSv/yr.

'''Limits''' - The city of Ramsar in northern Iran has background levels up to 135 mSv/yr due to underground concentrations of Uranium and mobile decay products.  Low Earth Orbit locations range from 80-160 mSv/yr, and locations above this can reach much higher levels from trapped particle belts and Solar particle events. 

===Ping Time===

'''Definition''' - Minimum round trip communication delay to next nearest 5% of human population, in seconds.  Depending on location, this may be by wired or wireless methods.  

'''Estimate''' - In theory all of the Earth is within 0.13 second ping time from any other point, but actual communications systems in place increase this value.  We assume at least voice/cellphone bandwidth for communications.  There are now more fixed and mobile telephone connections than there are people, so again, in theory, everyone has access to one.  From Slovakia, around 5% of the world population is within about 600 km.  Theoretical ping time is then 8 milliseconds (ms). The distance from Tahiti to major population centers is roughly 6600 km. Therefore best case ping time is 44 ms.  Given actual routing, and fiber-optic speeds, this is likely to be more like 100 ms.   

'''Limits''' - The worst case on Earth is no worse than locations like Tahiti, which require submarine cable, or satellite relay through the Iridium network.  Thus the limits for Earth are the same as for the Temperate range.  Space locations can range to 45,000 seconds from Earth to the Kuiper Belt.

===Travel Time===

'''Definition''' - Maximum one way normal travel time for humans, in hours or days, from the nearest 5% of human population.

'''Estimate''' -  In dense areas such as Europe the maximum direct distance to reach 5% of the world's population is about 600 km.  Allowing for actual highway routing and travel speed, we can estimate 8 hours to reach any point in that radius.  Ninety percent of the world's land area can be reached within 48 hours according to the '''[http://bioval.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/gam/index.htm EU Joint Research Centre]''' map of accessibility.

'''Limits''' - The same accessibility map places parts of the Tibetan plateau at 20 days travel to a city of any size. '''[[w:Pole_of_inaccessibility|Point Nemo]]''', the farthest point in the world from land, is about 4000 km by sea from the nearest airports.  Therefore it is about 10 days travel by chartered ship.  Current travel time to space is measured in months to years, mostly because trips carrying humans are rare.  The actual transit time from the launch site is 2-3 days

===Stay Time===

'''Definition''' - Average per person stay time per location, in years.  People are assumed to stay in the same location if they live and sleep in the same place on a regular basis.  

'''Estimate''' - In the US, in 2010-2011, 3.9% of the population moved to a different county in one year.  We will take a county to represent a &quot;location&quot;.  Therefore the average stay time is 25 years.  We assume there are significant parts of the world where the average person does not move far from their place of birth, thus the average stay time in one location is their life expectancy of about 70 years.  

'''Limits''' - The fastest growing counties in the US in 2011 had a growth rate of 10%, and thus an average stay time of 7 years if both growth and normal mobility are counted. Stay times in space are currently much shorter than this because there are no permanent residents, and time is limited by zero gravity and radiation exposure.  We invert the time scale for space, and set a minimum stay time of 10% of Earth, or 0.7 years, as the initial range. At the other extreme, stay times are bounded by life expectancy, so are no higher than 70 years.

===Transport Energy===

'''Definition''' - Maximum total energy to reach a location from nearest 5% of population, by most efficient method, in MJ/kg.  Includes kinetic, potential, and friction energy cost.  

'''Estimate''' - For Earth, since most of the surface is near the same potential, this is mostly frictional losses for rail or ocean shipping.  Rail transport consumes 330 BTU/ton-mile, or 216 J/kg-km.  Assuming a total transport distance of 1000 km for dense areas, including partial road travel from nearest rail point, we get about 0.215 MJ/kg.  Ships consume 375 J/kg-km. Eastern Australia is about 6000 km by ship from the nearest 5% of the worlds population, giving 2.25 MJ/kg.

'''Limits''' - Assuming a mule pulling a cart equal to its body mass for 20 days to reach inaccessible areas in Tibet, we get 1.8 MJ/kg transport energy.  If we then add another 2000 km by rail to reach 5% of the world's population, this adds another 0.43 MJ/kg, for a total of 2.23 MJ/kg.  Assuming transport distance of 7000 km from population centers to Tahiti, this gives 2.6 MJ/kg, which is the higher value.  Low Earth orbit requires 31 MJ/kg, so there is a large step function from Earth to space locations.

==Detailed Estimates==

===Atmospheric Temperature===

We selected the seasonal daily highs and lows for this parameter as the &quot;normal extremes&quot; that people are adapted to, even though particular days can exceed this range.  We start from the hot and cold ends of where people live, and count until we reach 5% in each.    We count by countries when they are small and consist of one climate region, or by sections when they are large.  If the population is concentrated in one part, we use climate data for that area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|Macedon during the Peloponnesian War, around 431 BC, and during the early Hellenistic period, around 336 BC, at the death of Phillip II of Macedon.]]

Macedonia or Macedon was an ancient Greek kingdom. The kingdom, centered in the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, was bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, the region of Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. The rise of Macedon, from a small kingdom at the periphery of Classical Greek affairs, to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world, occurred under the reign of Philip II.

==History==

===Early history and legend===

The first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BCE under the Argead Dynasty, who, according to legend, migrated to the region from the Greek city of Argos in Peloponnesus (thus the name Argead). The Macedonian tribe ruled by the Argeads, was itself called Argead (which translates as &quot;descended from Argos&quot;).

The kingdom was situated in the fertile alluvial plain, watered by the rivers Haliacmon and Axius, called Lower Macedonia, north of the mountain Olympus. Around the time of Alexander I of Macedon, the Argead Macedonians started to expand into Upper Macedonia, lands inhabited by independent Macedonian tribes like the Lyncestae and the Elmiotae and to the West, beyond Axius river, into Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, and Almopia, regions settled by, among others, many Thracian tribes. To the north of Macedonia lay various non-Greek peoples such as the Paeonians due north, the Thracians to the northeast, and the Illyrians, with whom the Macedonians were frequently in conflict, to the northwest. To the south lay Thessaly, with whose inhabitants the Macedonians had much in common both culturally and politically, while to west lay Epirus, with whom the Macedonians had a peaceful relationship and in the 4th century BC formed an alliance against Illyrian raids.

Near the modern city of Veria, Perdiccas I (or, more likely, his son, Argaeus I) built his capital, Aigai (modern Vergina). After a brief period under Persian rule under Darius Hystaspes, the state regained its independence under King Alexander I (495–450 BCE). In the Peloponnesian War Macedon was a secondary power that alternated in support between Sparta and Athens

===Involvement in the Classical Greek world===

Prior to the 4th century BC, the kingdom covered a region approximately corresponding to the Western and Central parts of province of Macedonia in modern Greece. A unified Macedonian state was eventually established by King Amyntas III (c. 393–370 BCE), though it still retained strong contrasts between the cattle-rich coastal plain and the fierce isolated tribal hinterland, allied to the king by marriage ties. They controlled the passes through which barbarian invasions came from Illyria to the north and northwest. It became increasingly Atticised during this period, though prominent Athenians appear to have regarded the Macedonians as uncouth. Before the establishment of the League of Corinth (338/337 BCE), even though the Macedonians apparently spoke a dialect of the Greek language and claimed proudly that they were Greeks, they were not considered to fully share the classical Greek culture by many of the inhabitants of the southern city states, because they did not share the ''polis'' based style of government. Herodotus, one of the foremost biographers in antiquity who lived in Greece at the time when the Macedonian king Alexander I was in power, recorded in his ''Histories'', 5. 22:

:&lt;small&gt;&quot;And that these descendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes, as they themselves say, I happen to know myself, and not only so, but I will prove in the succeeding history that they are Hellenes. Moreover the Hellanodikai, who manage the games at Olympia, decided that they were so: for when Alexander wished to contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into the arena, the Hellenes who were to run against him tried to exclude him, saying that the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but for Hellenes: since however Alexander proved that he was of Argos, he was judged to be a Hellene, and when he entered the contest of the foot-race his lot came out with that of the first.&quot;
:&lt;/small&gt;

Over the 4th century Macedon became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of Ancient Greece, but it also retained more archaic features like the palace-culture, first at Aegae (modern Vergina) then at Pella, resembling Mycenaean culture more than classic Hellenic city-states, and other archaic customs, like Philip's multiple wives in addition to his Epirote queen Olympias, mother of Alexander.

Another archaic remnant was the very persistence of a hereditary monarchy which wielded formidable – sometimes absolute – power, although this was at times checked by the landed aristocracy, and often disturbed by power struggles within the royal family itself. This contrasted sharply with the Greek cultures further south, where the ubiquitous city-states mostly possessed aristocratic or democratic institutions; the de facto monarchy of tyrants, in which heredity was usually more of an ambition rather than the accepted rule; and the limited, predominantly military and sacerdotal, power of the twin hereditary Spartan kings. The same might have held true of feudal institutions like serfdom, which may have persisted in Macedon well into historical times. Such institutions were abolished by city-states well before Macedon's rise (most notably by the Athenian legislator Solon's famous σεισάχθεια ''seisachtheia'' laws).

===Rise of Macedon===

King Amyntas, who had established a unified Macedonian state, had three sons; the first two, Alexander II and Perdiccas III reigned only briefly. Perdiccas III's infant heir was deposed by Amyntas' third son, Philip II of Macedon, who made himself king and ushered in a period of Macedonian dominance in Greece. Under Philip II, (359–336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians, Thracians, and Illyrians. Among other conquests, he annexed the regions of Pelagonia and Southern Paeonia.
[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|left|thumb|Kingdom of Macedon after Philip's II death.]]

Philip redesigned the army of Macedon adding a number of variations to the traditional ''hoplite'' force to make it far more effective. He added the ''hetairoi'', a well armoured heavy cavalry, and more light infantry, both of which added greater flexibility and responsiveness to the force. He also lengthened the spear and shrank the shield of the main infantry force, increasing its offensive capabilities.
[[File:Philip II of Macedon CdM.jpg|thumb|''Niketerion'' (victory medallion) bearing the effigy of king Philip II of Macedon, 3rd century AD, probably minted during the reign of Roman Emperor Alexander Severus.]]

Philip began to rapidly expand the borders of his kingdom. He first campaigned in the north against non-Greek peoples such as the Illyrians, securing his northern border and gaining much prestige as a warrior. He next turned east, to the territory along the northern shore of the Aegean. The most important city in this area was Amphipolis, which controlled the way into Thrace and also was near valuable silver mines. This region had been part of the Athenian Empire, and Athens still considered it as in their sphere. The Athenians attempted to curb the growing power of Macedonia, but were limited by the outbreak of the Social War. They could also do little to halt Philip when he turned his armies south and took over most of Thessaly.

Control of Thessaly meant Philip was now closely involved in the politics of central Greece. 356 BCE saw the outbreak of the Third Sacred War that pitted Phocis against Thebes and its allies. Thebes recruited the Macedonians to join them and at the Battle of Crocus Field Phillip decisively defeated Phocis and its Athenian allies. As a result Macedonia became the leading state in the Amphictyonic League and Phillip became head of the Pythian Games, firmly putting the Macedonian leader at the centre of the Greek political world.

In the continuing conflict with Athens Philip marched east through Thrace in an attempt to capture Byzantium and the Bosphorus, thus cutting off the Black Sea grain supply that provided Athens with much of its food. The siege of Byzantium failed, but Athens realized the grave danger the rise of Macedon presented and under Demosthenes built a coalition of many of the major states to oppose the Macedonians. Most importantly Thebes, which had the strongest ground force of any of the city states, joined the effort. The allies met the Macedonians at the Battle of Chaeronea and were decisively defeated, leaving Philip and the Macedonians the unquestioned master of Greece.

  tar xvzf sparsehash-1.11.tar.gz
  cd sparsehash-1.11
  ./configure -prefix=/home/USER

  make install

  

Now get ABySS (assuming you have the BOOST libraries installed)

  wget http://www.bcgsc.ca/downloads/abyss/abyss-1.2.7.tar.gz
  tar xzvf abyss-1.2.7.tar.gz
  cd abyss-1.2.7

you could type

  wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR001/SRR001665/SRR001665_1.fastq.gz
  wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR001/SRR001665/SRR001665_2.fastq.gz

unpack the two files

  gunzip SRR001665_1.fastq.gz
  gunzip SRR001665_2.fastq.gz

You will need to get SOAPdenovo and the data prepare module

  wget http://soap.genomics.org.cn/down/x86_64.linux/SOAPdenovo31mer.tgz
  tar xvzf SOAPdenovo31mer.tgz
  

Also we have to make a config file. We name this cont.config

  #maximal read length
  max_rd_len=36
  [LIB]
  #average insert size
  avg_ins=200
  #if sequence needs to be reversed 
  reverse_seq=0
  #use for contig building only
  asm_flags=1
  #in which order the reads are used while scaffolding
  rank=1
  #fastq files
  q1=./SRR001665_1.fastq
  q2=./SRR001665_2.fastq

  
And then we scaffold using a Kmer size of 31 (the read length is 36). We use the whole SOAP pipeline by specifying the &quot;all&quot; parameter
By setting asm_flags to 3 the same library would be used for scaffolding as well. In this case SOAP will terminate in the scaffolding step with a floating point exception as there is nothing to scaffold with. Contigs will be found nevertheless in EC.contigs.

  ./SOAPdenovo31mer all -K 31 -s cont.config -o EC

      <text xml:space="preserve">Climate is the atmosphere of a organization.  More specifically, climate is the atmosphere of supportiveness or defensiveness that people feel within an organization.  It is an integral part of organizational culture.  Do they feel safe? Protected? Appreciated? Are they confidant that their opinions count? Do they know that when they have something to say, they have a way to say it so that it will be heard, and that people will listen and take their ideas or comments seriously?  The overall organizational climate also includes the organization’s communication climate—how free people feel to communicate at work, especially about bad news or negative information.  When people feel they cannot communicate bad news for fear of reprisal, the organization loses valuable information about how it operates.&lt;br /&gt;

Information will flow much more freely in an organization where there is a positive communication climate, but may not flow at all, especially when it is most needed, if there is a negative communication climate.  A supportive communication climate allows for a better exchange of information and a more positive work environment.   An organization’s climate can be equated to the weather—it is the atmosphere that people feel within the organization itself.  It is an integral part of organizational culture.  More specifically, organizational climate is the atmosphere of supportiveness or defensiveness people feel within the organization and the feelings they have about sending and receiving messages.  &lt;br /&gt;
 
To build a supportive communication climate you need to send messages that acknowledge effort, creativity, and teamwork, engage people in the decision making process, establish trust, which is maintained through consistency, congruity, reliability, and integrity. It is not enough to be a nice manager and create a nice environment in which to communicate and work.  You must also communicate a sense of challenge to your employees by placing importance on high quality and establishing high performance goals.

Development cooperation is done at its best when the partners have a common interest at stake, when they all are going to benefit from the development process and when they are together analyzing the problems, setting the objectives and are working together to  produce the expected changes. This requires a healthy [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|communication climate]] where  the interests of all partners are integrated so as to achieve a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#The positive sum game|positive-sum relation]]. see more in ⇒ [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The participatory approach|The participatory approach]]

[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|Communication Climate]] is the atmosphere of a team or an organization.  More specifically, climate is the atmosphere of supportiveness or defensiveness that people feel within an organization.  
&lt;br /&gt;

According to communication scholar, W. Charles Redding the communication climate in any organization is composed of five components.  You can create a positive organizational and communication climate through:

* '''Supportiveness''': To build a supportive communication climate you need to send messages that acknowledge effort, creativity, and teamwork.  A supportive communication climate allows for a better exchange of information and a more positive work environment.   
* '''Participative Decision Making:''' To create a positive communication climate you need to engage people in the decision making process.  You can do this by having employees participate in identifying and solving problems that affect them and their working conditions.  Participative decision-making means that you assist your employees in setting standards and goals for the work they do. 
* '''Trust:''' Before there can be effective employee communication, there must be a climate of trust (the feeling that another’s motives are what he or she says they are).  An employee trusts in superiors when they have confidence in the superior’s intentions and motives, when the superior has proven to keep his or her word, when they are sincere not only in their dealings with themselves but with other people, and when the employees are not afraid that they will be met with retaliation for supplying negative information. . See Building a Climate of Trust ; Communicating Credibility; Behaviors that Endanger Trust; Factors that may block the flow of information 
* '''Openness:''' Openness refers to the candid disclosure of information, particularly negative information and the sharing of feelings and opinions regarding the organization and its activities. Open communication in terms of expressing your ideas and feelings through verbal channels in organizations has led to higher production and better performance within the organization. However, simply “showing” feelings and not discussing them openly, is viewed as dysfunctional and can be very counter productive.  See Encouraging Openness
* '''Emphasis on High Quality Goals:''' Placing importance on high quality and high performance goals has to do with the content of the communication that you have with your employees.  Such an emphasis is the most important focus of the content of your messages to your employees.  It is not enough to be a nice manager and create a nice environment in which to communicate and work.  You must also communicate a sense of challenge to your employees.

Another important elements of the communication climate are
* the organization leading ethics
* the approach towards employee empowerment, that is a necessary element of organizational learning and a prerequisite to an organization becoming a learning organization. learning organization&quot;

==Astronomy and Planetary Science==

'''[[w:Astronomy|Astronomy]]''' is the study of all objects and phenomena beyond the Earth's atmosphere, and '''[[w:Planetary_science|Planetary Science]]''' is specifically the study of condensed objects orbiting stars.  Since this is where space systems function, a basic understanding of these fields is highly relevant to working on such projects.  For more background than will fit in this book, see:

* Nick Strobel's '''[http://www.astronomynotes.com/index.html Astronomy Notes]'''
* The Wikibook '''[[General_Astronomy]]'''

One of the key ideas to emerge from these studies is the '''[[w:Uniformitarianism|Uniformity of the Universe]]'''.  As far as we can tell, the natural laws and processes that operate now have always operated in the past, are the same everywhere in the Universe, and we expect them to continue to be so in the future.  Having learned what these general principles are, we can then apply them to specific examples as needed.

===Origin and Evolution of the Universe===

The '''[[w:Universe|Universe]]''' is the totality of existence. The origin and history of the Universe as a whole is of great interest to many people for its own sake, but only selected features are relevant for space systems design.  This includes that '''[[w:Baryon|Baryonic]]''' matter (the ordinary kind of matter that we and the Earth are made of) started out as about 76% Hydrogen, 24% Helium, and almost nothing else.  Gravity caused the nearly uniform early Universe to develop denser regions with emptier regions in between.  The denser regions coalesced into many '''[[w:Galaxy|Galaxies]]''', of which the '''[[w:Milky_Way|Milky Way]]''' galaxy is the one which our Sun and planets are part of.

Galaxies in turn form denser condensations where nuclear reactions occur, which we call stars.  The reactions convert lighter elements into heavier ones, increasing the proportion by mass of Helium to about 27% and heavier elements to about 2%.  Stellar nuclear reactions release a great deal of energy, but this source is finite.  Thus the Sun and other stars will eventually run out of fuel, and the composition of the Universe will reach a stable condition.  Several lines of evidence indicate the current age of the Universe is about 13.6 billion years, and the era of stars would last about 100 trillion years.  If the expansion of the Universe continues to accelerate, then most of the Universe will be rendered undetectable long before all the nearby stars die out.  Regardless of the eventual destiny of the Universe, on human time scales it will last a long while relatively unchanged.   

===The Milky Way Galaxy===

The oldest stars in our home galaxy are about 13 billion years old, which indicates the galaxy started forming, at least to the point that stars condensed, shortly after the Universe as a whole formed.  The baryonic mass is embedded in a five times more massive amount of material which only reveals itself by its gravity.  Since this material does not form stars, it is dark, and thus called '''[[w:Dark_Matter|Dark Matter]]'''.  It is poorly understood at present, and our main concern for space projects is how it affects the motions of baryonic objects such as stars, planets, and molecular clouds.  Evidence from the composition and motions of parts of the Milky Way indicate it formed by infall of gas clouds and smaller galaxies, which continues to the present.  The shape seems to have evolved starting with the halo and central bulge, followed by growth of the disk shaped region.  The baryonic mass of our galaxy is estimated at 200-300 billion times the Sun's.

The Sun is in the disk region, about 27,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way, orbiting at about 220 km/s and thus taking about 225-250 million years to complete an orbit.  We do not know the exact shape of the Sun's orbit but it is suspected to be elliptical.  Random motions of nearby stars are on the order of 20-30 km/s. Over the age of the Sun these random motions amount to 450,000 light years, which is much more than the circumference of the Sun's orbit. This indicates the current nearby stars are not the ones the Sun was born near.  In fact, the current stars within 100 light years will be replaced by an entirely different set in 1 million years.

===Formation of the Sun===

We observe new stars forming in denser regions of our galaxy known as '''[[w:Molecular_cloud|Molecular clouds]]''', and we assume our Sun and the rest of the Solar System formed in such a cloud, which has since dispersed.  Based on radioactive dating we estimate our Solar System to be 4.6 billion years old, which is about 1/3 the estimated age of the Universe.  The presence of 1.5% heavier elements in the Sun confirms that it formed from recycled matter that had previously been enriched by older generation stars.  Loss of heat from radiation allowed gravity to collect part of the original molecular cloud into a distinct object called the '''Solar Nebula'''.  The core of the nebula continued to contract, and the increased pressure caused by self-gravity heated that core to create a '''Proto-Sun'''.  Once the core of the proto-Sun reached a temperature of 12 million kelvins, hydrogen fusion could begin, and the Sun proper was born.  This collapse until ignition took around 30 million years.

Nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun have converted Hydrogen to Helium, increasing the concentration there to about 60%.  Since Helium is heavier, the core has gotten denser and hotter, thus increasing the reaction rate of the remaining Hydrogen and the total energy output of the Sun by about 40%.  The current output is 3.846 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Watts.  This will continue to increase by about 1% per hundred million years.

===Solar System Evolution===

====Planetary Formation====

Whatever internal motions the Solar Nebula had, there was no way to dispose of angular momentum (net rotation).  Therefore a small part of the nebula remained orbiting the proto-Sun rather than falling in, and keeping most of the angular momentum.  This region is estimated to have been 50 AU in radius, and disk shaped as the net result of rotation.  The increasing temperature of the proto-Sun created a temperature gradient based on distance from the center.  The innermost part was too warm for icy material to remain solid, while the outer parts were cold enough for water, ammonia, and other ices.  No part was cold enough for Hydrogen and Helium to condense.  Particles condensed out of the nebula as the flat shape radiated heat to space and the optical thickness radially kept the outer parts from being heated by the Sun.  Small particles could grow first by sticking to each other, then later by gravitational attraction.  The mix of objects which formed this way are called '''Planetesimals'''.

Gravitational attraction is a runaway process.  As an object gets larger, it can attract objects from a larger distance, thus increasing its growth rate.  Larger objects also have a potential energy well, so approaching objects will accelerate to impact.  The impact energy eventually becomes large enough to melt the object.  In addition, there were more radioactive elements in the early Solar System than there are now, and decay of those elements contributed to the heating of the growing bodies.  The largest objects were able to affect the orbits of the smaller ones, causing them to either impact or get scattered away.  This tended to clear out a region around each large object.  The very largest objects had a sufficiently deep gravity well that they could collect gaseous Hydrogen and Helium, forming the gas giants. Some of the scattered objects, and planetesimals which formed at the outer edges of the nebula, have survived relatively unchanged beyond Neptune.  The material from the inner Solar System which could not condense there tended to be blown outwards, and the point where they could solidify is near Jupiter's orbit, which may account for the large mass of Jupiter and Saturn compared to the rest of the planets.  The entire accretion and clearing process took about 100 million years, with the final growth of the planets perhaps taking 10 million years.

====Planetary Evolution====

The bodies which were large enough to melt from impacts and radioactive heating had the denser compounds sink to the center. Iron and related metals are the heaviest common materials, so they ended up in the cores.  Going outwards, the layers include rocky minerals of different densities (a mantle and crust), then ices and an atmosphere if the body formed with these components.  This layered structure is what we find today in the planets and larger satellites, along with the composition change with distance from the Sun.  These trends are not strict rules because random collisions and gravitational scattering have changed the location and make up of the objects since they formed, and smaller bodies have lost original atmosphere and in some cases ices.  After the original formation era of about 100 million years, the larger planets continued to interact with each other chaotically until they settled into a relatively stable arrangement about 3.8 billion years ago.  The planetary shifts affected the smaller bodies, who continued to be scattered or impact.  The evidence of this is still visible in craters and the locations of scattered objects.  

Bodies in the Solar System continue to interact gravitationally, and impacts and scattering continue, but at a lower rate. Bodies like the Earth have active processes that tend to erase craters, while smaller ones lack an atmosphere or crustal motion, and preserve them through the life of the Solar System. The resulting current distribution of matter, and the very large energy output of the Sun, are the main resources to work with for space projects.

===The Earth-Moon System===

'''[[w:Earth_science|Earth Science]]''' is the study of the Earth and its component parts.  The study of the Earth predates detailed study of other planets because this is where humans started, and it continues to be the best studied planet.  In the context of modern astronomy and planetary science, the Earth is now studied as one planet among many.  In the context of human history it still has a special place because we evolved here, and until now, none of us has left the Earth-Moon system.  Nearly all of the design, materials, equipment, and operations of space projects to date has actually occurred on Earth.  This will continue to be true for at least the near future.  Therefore some understanding of the Earth is still needed to carry out space projects.  For an introduction to the field see:

* CK12 Foundation - '''[http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Earth-Science-Concepts/ Earth Science Concepts]'''

The Earth formed in the same way as the rest of the large bodies in the Solar System, mostly by collisions.  Debris from a very large collision late in the process formed the Moon, explaining the difference in its composition relative to the Earth.  Impacts and radioactive decay released enough energy to melt the entire planet, and the high temperature likely led to loss of some of the more volatile ices and gases.  Continued radioactive decay, supplemented by other energy releases, has kept the Earth's interior hot. It has an inner metallic '''Ccore''' solidified by pressure, even though it is about the same temperature as the Sun's surface (6000 K).  Outside of this is a liquid metallic outer core, and then a rocky layer called the '''Mantle'''.  The deeper parts of this layer have temperatures of 2000K or more.  Although pressure keeps them solid at these high temperatures, the rock is able to flow slowly over time in a type of thermal circulation taking on the order of 100 million years.  The least dense and coolest rocks form a roughly 120 km thick solid layer called the '''Lithosphere''', which has a relatively high temperature gradient relative to the rest of the planet.  By composition the lower part of the Lithosphere is part of the Mantle, and the outer part is less dense rock called the '''Crust'''.

The internal motions of the Mantle and heat traveling outwards can cause local temperature to get higher than the melting point dictated by local pressure.  The molten rock is called '''Magma''', and its composition can vary because different minerals have different melting curves.  Movement of magma and bulk Mantle circulation drive about 20 pieces of the Crust, called '''Plates''' to slowly move and change shape.  These movements and '''Weathering''', the mechanical and chemical changes from the surface environment, explain the geography and geology we find today. These dynamic processes combine to erode most of the early Earth's history.  The current surface averages ten percent or less of the age of the planet as a whole.

'''The Moon''' 

The Moon formed by gravitational accretion of the debris from a major impact.  It formed much closer to the Earth than it is now, but tides act to slow the Earth's rotation and increase the Moon's orbit, a process that continues.  The Moon is smaller than the Earth, and so lost its internal heat faster, and is now mostly solid. It is too small to retain an atmosphere because of the low escape velocity.  Thus the Moon retains evidence of its early history in the form of large impact basins and craters of all sizes.  The larger basins filled with magma to create relatively flat and darker areas mistakenly named '''Mare''' (Latin for &quot;Sea&quot;), because they were thought to have water.  The greater tides from the time the Moon was closer to Earth slowed the Moon's rotation so the same side faces us, with a little wobble.  It also caused most of the Mare to form on the near side.

==Chemistry==

The science of '''[[General_Chemistry|Chemistry]]''' has historically been considered a separate subject from physics.  In a more general sense it can be considered a subset of low energy physics where arrangements of atoms via atomic bonding is important.  We humans happen to require living conditions where atomic bonding is important, so we give that energy regime more attention.  In reality, something like 99% of the matter in the Universe is in the plasma state, where electrons are no longer bound to atoms, and inter-atom bonding is rare.

The importance of chemical reactions to space projects until now was primarily in providing high temperature gases to propel rockets.  In future projects reactions in life support systems and extraction and preparation of materials in space will become much more important.  We will therefore summarize some key ideas here, and refer the reader to the following sources for more detail:

God spoke to Moses, identified Himself as the God of the Patriarchs, and acknowledged hearing the moaning of the Israelites. God instructed Moses to tell the Israelites that God would free them, make them God’s people, and bring them to the Promised Land. But the Israelites would not listen because of their distress and hard labor. God told Moses to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go, but Moses complained that Pharaoh would not heed him, a man of impeded speech.

The text interjects a partial genealogy of Reuben, Simeon, and finally Levi, including Moses and his family.

God placed Aaron in the role of Moses’ prophet, to speak to Pharaoh. God intended to harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that God might show signs and marvels. God told how Aaron could cast down his rod and it would turn into a snake, and Aaron did so before Pharaoh. Pharaoh caused his magicians to do the same, but Aaron’s rod swallowed their rods. Pharaoh’s heart stiffened.

===The plagues of Egypt===
God began visiting ten plagues on Egypt.  God told Moses to go to Pharaoh at his morning bath, demand of him to let the Israelites go to worship in the wilderness, and have Aaron strike the Nile with his rod and turn it into blood. Moses and Aaron did so, and the fish died and the Nile stank. But when the Egyptian magicians did the same, Pharaoh’s heart stiffened.
Seven days later, God told Moses to have Aaron hold his arm with the rod over the river and bring up frogs, and they did so. The magicians did the same. Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron to plead with God to remove the frogs and said he's let the Israelites go; Moses did so, but Pharaoh became stubborn and did not let the Israelites leave.

God told Moses to have Aaron strike the dust with his rod, to turn it to lice throughout the land, and they did so. The magicians tried to do the same, but they could not. The magicians told Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God!”  But Pharaoh’s heart stiffened.

God loosed swarms of insects against the Egyptians, but not Goshen, where the Israelites dwelt. Pharaoh told Moses and Aaron to go sacrifice to God within Egypt, but Moses insisted on going three days into the wilderness. Pharaoh agreed, in exchange for Moses’ prayer to lift the plague. But when God removed the insects, Pharaoh became stubborn again.

God struck the Egyptian’s livestock with a pestilence, sparing the Israelites’ livestock. But Pharaoh remained stubborn.

God told Moses to take handfuls of soot from the kiln and throw it toward the sky, so that it would become a fine dust, causing boils on man and beast throughout Egypt, and he did so. But God stiffened Pharaoh’s heart.

God told Moses to threaten Pharaoh with hail. Those who feared God’s word brought their slaves and livestock indoors. God sent thunder and hail, which struck down all exposed in Egypt, but did not strike Goshen. Pharaoh confessed his wrong, agreed to let the Israelites go, and asked Moses and Aaron to pray to end the hail. Moses did so, but Pharaoh reverted to his guilty ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=License to Censor: THE USE OF MEDIA REGULATION TO RESTRICT PRESS FREEDOM=

Researched and written by Dr. Karin Deutsch Karlekar, Senior Researcher and Managing Editor of Freedom of
the Press, with the exception of the Lebanon and Ecuador chapters. The Lebanon chapter was
researched and written by Courtney C. Radsch, Senior Program Officer for the Global Freedom
of Expression Campaign and the Ecuador chapter by Javier Sierra, Projects Director of the
World Press Freedom Committee of Freedom House. Dr. Karin Deutsch Karlekar and Courtney
C. Radsch served as the report’s general editors.

==INTRODUCTION==

In some parts of the world, the threats to press freedom are explicit and often violent. Journalists
are murdered or imprisoned, states maintain strict media monopolies, and domestic audiences are
cut off from foreign news sources. Such unambiguously hostile conditions typically elicit strong
responses from international advocacy groups and democracies that are committed to defending
freedom of expression. However, in a much broader range of countries, governments are using
the more subtle tools of media regulation to restrict press freedom, maintaining a veneer of
legality and pluralism that is less likely to draw attention or criticism from abroad. Manipulation
of the regulatory framework allows leaders to either tolerate or rein in influential news outlets
depending on the political situation, and permits even democratically elected governments to
fortify themselves against future electoral competition.

This special report describes the primary types of media regulation that are used to
restrict press freedom, including:

 statutory controls on licensing and registration;

 the creation of nominally independent regulatory bodies with built-in avenues for
political influence;

 legal imposition of vague or burdensome content requirements

Official actions sometimes represent the normal application of highly restrictive laws,
while in other cases executive or judicial authorities act arbitrarily, outside the bounds of the law,
or in an overtly politicized manner. Government efforts to promote statutory regulation can be
particularly effective when self-regulatory mechanisms like media councils or ombudsmen are
nonexistent or perceived as weak or underutilized.

Through a detailed examination of such threats in eight different national media
environments—Ecuador, Georgia, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Africa, Uganda, and
Zimbabwe—this study assesses the growing danger they pose to media freedom worldwide and
provides recommendations on how to counter the negative trend.

==BACKGROUND==

Historically, some degree of regulation has been imposed on all types of media, but broadcast
media have usually been subject to a wider range of government controls, including more
stringent licensing rules, tighter restrictions on content, and limitations on private or foreign
ownership. This discrepancy can be attributed in part to the argument that while the number and
character of print outlets are limited only by demand and financing, broadcast media rely on the
airwaves, a finite public resource, meaning access must be parceled out and regulated by the
state.

One must distinguish between regulation that is minimal—for example, a pro forma
requirement to simply register a new outlet—and regulation that entails extensive, broadly
worded, or onerous licensing requirements, which can be enforced selectively as a method of
control. In freer countries, the predominantly private print media are generally unregulated or
self-regulated, and both private and public-service broadcast media have traditionally been
subject to limited state regulation. In less free media environments, print media outlets are often
subject to state-imposed statutory regulation, while the broadcast sector in many cases remains
mostly or entirely under state control.
In addition to the technical differences between print and broadcast media that have led to
greater regulation of the latter, many governments have regarded broadcast outlets as a greater
potential threat, largely because of their ability to overcome literacy barriers and reach larger
audiences. Broadcast media can also transmit live events, leaving little opportunity for the
authorities to censor information after the fact. Such concerns have led incoming or maturing
authoritarian regimes to make dominance of the national broadcast sector a high priority.
For example, after taking office as president of Russia in 2000, Vladimir Putin moved to
assert control over broadcast media through coerced buyouts, a campaign of intimidation against
billionaire businessmen with media assets, and concerted efforts to purge foreign-produced
content from many radio stations. More recently, the government of President Hugo Chávez in
Venezuela refused to renew the terrestrial broadcast license of the popular Radio Caracas
Television (RCTV), accusing the outlet of supporting a failed coup attempt and thus breaching
broadcast regulations. The closure of RCTV has been followed by the withdrawal of dozens of
private radio licenses. Similar approaches have prevailed in other parts of the former Soviet
Union and in the Middle East, with governments maintaining a firmer regulatory grip on
broadcasting than on print.

The increased manipulation of regulatory controls in recent years is in many ways a
response to a longer-term trend of diversification of broadcast media, which has been reflected in
successive editions of Freedom House’s annual Freedom of the Press report. In some cases, as
part of broader democratic openings or economic privatization programs over the last two
decades, governments have introduced new laws allowing the establishment of private outlets
where previously only state-run broadcasters were permitted. Other factors include the spread of
international or regional satellite broadcasters, as well as nationally focused satellite stations that
operate outside the target country’s borders. No longer inclined or able to engage in direct,
across-the-board censorship, the authorities in many countries have turned to more selective
controls, using licensing and regulatory frameworks in a politicized way to cripple only those
outlets that are seen as a threat to the government.

==METHODS OF CONTROL==

The use of regulatory mechanisms to restrict media freedom can take a number of forms. Official
control over the regulatory process can be built into the legal framework from the outset, through
either restrictive licensing laws or the processes for appointing the leadership of a regulatory
body. However, even in countries with a relatively well-constructed legal framework, the laws
can be selectively applied or misused to close critical outlets, and political leaders can exert
informal, extralegal influence over nominally
independent regulators.

===Licensing Rules===
----
Licensing is the primary method by which
the initial establishment of private media
outlets can be regulated. International bestpractice
standards call for minimal
notification or registration requirements,
which should not be used as a basis for
denying an outlet permission to function or
for governing content. Licensing of print
media is rare in more open environments,
while in more restrictive media environments
print media are subject to licensing
procedures that range from the simple, as in
Pakistan, to the extremely onerous, as in
Zimbabwe.
----
The most overt form of media restriction entails
outright state monopolies. While these still exist in
a number of highly repressive media environments,
the majority of countries now permit some form of
private ownership of broadcast media. In most
cases, private outlets exist alongside state-run
counterparts, although the private-public ratio
varies by country and region.1 It is important to
note that state ownership does not necessarily lead
to politicized control over content and the loss of
editorial independence. In practice, however, truly
independent public-service broadcasting has been
difficult to achieve except in democratic countries
with a long history of such institutions. In Eastern Europe and Southern Africa, for instance,
nominally independent public broadcasters that were formed in the 1990s following major
democratic openings remain subject to pressure from government officials and political parties.

A case in point is the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), a state-owned entity that
is broadly perceived as presenting viewpoints that align with those of the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) party. In more restrictive media environments, state-run media dominate the
landscape and serve as mouthpieces for the government.

Licensing systems are also sometimes imposed on journalists themselves. Best practice
calls for open access to the profession, with no licensing process or other criteria—such as
membership in a particular professional body or educational credentials—for aspiring
journalists.2 Again, such requirements are less common in more open and democratic media
environments, but they exist to varying degrees in transitional or authoritarian media systems,
and in some cases they are used as an overt method of control over the media. A recent report for
the Center for International Media Assistance found that in over quarter of the more than 100
countries examined, the state plays some role in licensing journalists.3

By contrast, most countries, including democratic states, have traditionally featured
significant regulation of private broadcast outlets, typically including licensing and frequency
allocations by an official regulatory body. Ideally, an independent, nonpartisan entity adjudicates
requests for licenses and spectrum according to a clearly defined legal process, and in a
transparent and unbiased manner, so that media diversity is not compromised.4 Regulatory
bodies following this model are common in North America and Western Europe, as well as in a
number of other democratic settings. For example, in Mali, while the law requires broadcasters
to be licensed in order to receive a frequency and operate, the rules are straightforward,
bureaucratic procedures and financial hurdles are minimal, and the regulatory body in charge
functions independently.5

However, in less open systems, laws regulating broadcast licensing can provide ample
opportunities to restrict the dissemination of news and information. Exorbitant licensing fees can
bar new entrants to the market, perpetuating the dominance of state media. In Jordan, a new
licensing system that took effect in 2003 required high fees only for channels that intended to
broadcast political news; as a result, most new outlets air only music and other entertainment
programming.6

Licenses may also be denied to outlets with foreign ownership, and such rules are
sometimes enacted to target certain troublesome news sources. As part of a sweeping “media
industry development” decree issued in Fiji in June 2010, foreign ownership in any outlet—
whether print or broadcast—was capped at 10 percent, leading to the forced sale of the Fiji
Times, one of the country’s oldest independent newspapers and a strong voice for democratic
values.7

Geographical restrictions similarly serve to limit the reach and influence of private
outlets. A government may retain for itself the right to operate outlets with a national reach,
allowing smaller private outlets to operate only in certain geographic areas or with a limited
reach because of the equipment or technology available to them.

Additional burdensome measures could include requirements that force an outlet to
reregister every year, or to provide excessive personal information about the owners or staff
when applying for a license or registration.

Licensing restrictions that focus on content, as with the Jordanian system described above
or Lebanon’s restrictions on political news content, allow governments to foster a commercially
vibrant private media sector while curtailing critical news coverage. In the most extreme cases,
outlets might be legally required to submit planned programming for preapproval and possible
censorship by the state. In Syria, for instance, the Ministry of Information closely monitors
content to ensure adherence to government policies and directives.

In other settings, content restrictions may feature a prohibition on broadcasting news, or
conversely, a requirement to broadcast government-produced news material. In India, private FM
radio stations are not allowed to broadcast news content, while in neighboring Bangladesh,
private outlets are required to air selected government-produced news segments (in addition to
their own programming) as a condition of their operation. In Venezuela, all registered broadcast
outlets are required to carry the president’s speeches simultaneously and whenever they occur.
The cable arm of RCTV in Venezuela was suspended for more than a year and allowed back on
the air in early 2010 only after it agreed to this condition.8

Legal restrictions on broadcast content can also contain provisions that are overly vague,
giving the regulator wide discretion in its enforcement decisions. In recent years, a number of
countries—including India, Pakistan, and Turkey—have tried to regulate coverage of terrorism,
particularly material that could be seen as assisting or glorifying terrorist acts. However, industry
groups in the countries involved have raised concerns that broadly worded strictures could be
misapplied.

One such measure already in force is Venezuela’s 2004 Law for Social Responsibility in
Radio, Television, and Electronic Media, which prohibits broadcast stations from airing content
that could “promote, defend, or incite breaches of public order” or is “contrary to the security of
the nation.”9 A December 2010 amendment to the Organic Law of Telecommunications
extended the authority of the country’s National Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL)
to withdraw the license of any broadcaster that violated the law more than once, and shortened
license terms from 20 to 15 years; however, a controversial provision that would have required
owners of outlets to reregister with CONATEL in person was withdrawn from the final bill.

===Laws on Regulatory Bodies===

Legislation establishing an official regulatory body would ideally ensure its independence from
the political branches of government, political parties, and economic interests. This means
insulating the regulator from improper influence over its membership, appointments, financing,
and decision-making process.10 However, these laws can also be crafted in a way that both limits
the regulatory body’s autonomy from the outset and grants it such authority that the government
can use it to ensure official control over important parts of the media landscape.

A number of recent laws demonstrate
various governments’ intent to control the
broadcast sector, either directly or through an
obedient regulatory body. For example, the
Kenya Communications (Amendment) Act of
2009 gave the minister of information the
power to exercise editorial control over
broadcast content and to seize broadcast
stations and equipment. It also established a
communications commission appointed by the
minister, including four sitting government
officials, plus a chairman appointed by the
president. The commission would have the
power to issue broadcast licenses and impose
heavy fines and prison sentences for various
offenses.11 The law was heavily criticized, and
may be ameliorated by draft legislation
intended to bring existing statutes into
compliance with the new 2010 constitution by strengthening the independence of Kenya’s
regulatory bodies.12
----
Botswana’s December 2008 Media
Practitioners Act established a nominally
independent Media Council tasked with
upholding ethical standards and ensuring
media freedom. However, the legislation did
not contain supporting provisions to ensure
the council’s independence; in fact, it is
financially dependent on the government,
and its members are all appointed by the
minister of communication. This
compromised body was nevertheless granted
broad powers over the accreditation of
journalists and the supervision of media
conduct.
----

Such moves to ensure control over the regulator through legislation can occur even in a
relatively well-established democracy. In the second half of 2010, as part of a wide-ranging
package of changes to the media laws, Hungary enacted legislation that merged two existing
entities into a new National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NMHH). The prime
minister was granted the power to appoint the president of the NMHH for a nine-year term,
without limits on reappointment. The NMHH president also chairs a new, ostensibly autonomous
Media Council, whose four other members are appointed by the parliament; the ruling party
currently holds a two-thirds legislative majority. The Media Council has the authority to censure
and impose high fines on media outlets for broadly worded content violations, including failure
to provide “balanced coverage.”13 All types of media, including online outlets, will be required
to register with the NMHH. These changes were criticized by the opposition, press freedom
groups, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Some provisions
were softened by amendments passed in March 2011 after an outcry from the European Union,
but press freedom groups and the OSCE representative on media freedom continued to express
concerns that the laws had the potential to curb diverse and critical views.14

It is important to note that even when good laws have been passed, implementation may
lag severely, creating a vacuum of power and responsibilities. In Zambia, legislation to establish
an Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) was passed in 2002, but the regulator has not yet
been set up, and the Ministry of Information has apparently taken an ad hoc approach to both
granting and threatening to suspend or withdraw broadcast licenses.15 In Georgia, gaps between
the law and practice have led to the regulatory body’s independence being compromised and it
becoming unduly subject to political influence. And in Indonesia, the government has reclaimed
powers granted by law to nominally independent regulatory bodies for both print and broadcast,
creating a situation where the government has de facto control over the regulatory process.
Arbitrary or Extralegal Regulation

While governments often restrict press freedom using regulatory and licensing procedures that
are clearly defined by law, they can also act on an arbitrary or extralegal basis. Common tactics
include bureaucratic obstruction, threatened or actual suspensions without a firm legal
justification, sudden bans on certain types of content, and circumvention of established
regulatory systems by other arms of the government.

Bureaucratic foot-dragging can be an effective method of state control over the media
space, and is often used to withhold licenses from private outlets. This tactic has been employed
against print outlets; the Daily News in Zimbabwe, which had been shut down in 2003, was
forced to wait until 2010 to reopen despite court rulings in its favor. But more examples can be
found in the broadcast sector. In Ethiopia, for instance, the 1999 Broadcasting Proclamation
provided for the licensing of private radio broadcasters, but the government did not open the
licensing authority until 2002, and it had only awarded licenses to two private FM stations by
2006.16 A third station licensed in 2009 limits its content to music and other entertainment,
avoiding any political topics, according to IREX’s 2009 Media Sustainability Index.

Similarly, in the decade prior to Tunisia’s recent revolution, the country’s National
Frequencies Agency licensed just one television station and three radio broadcasters, all of which
were owned by business interests close to the government, while repeatedly ignoring
applications from independent outlets.17 And in December 2010 in Armenia, the presidentially
appointed regulator denied a 13th consecutive license request from A1+, an independent
television station whose license was rescinded in 2002, despite a 2008 ruling in its favor by the
European Court of Human Rights.18 In these cases, as in a number of other countries, favoritism
was shown to progovernment applicants, while requests by independent outlets were rejected or
pointedly ignored.

The threat of license revocation or suspension is another tactic that has been used
frequently to harass critical media. An outlet may be threatened with the loss of its license if it is
deemed to have contravened vaguely written laws on content, or if it simply crosses the
government’s unofficial redlines on acceptable coverage. In some cases the reason for the
suspension or withdrawal of the license is never made clear. One recent example comes from
Ukraine, where in August 2010 two independent television companies had a number of their
licenses withdrawn due to alleged irregularities in their initial allocation. However, Valeriy
Khoroshkovsky, the owner of a rival media group and the head of the Ukrainian Security
Service, was accused by one of the stations of influencing the decision.19 License renewals have
also been denied for political reasons in Ecuador and Bangladesh. Even stations that are not
directly affected by such decisions may engage in self-censorship to avoid similar repercussions
for critical coverage, damaging the diversity and vibrancy of the media sector as a whole.

Actual shutdowns of media outlets are sometimes processed through legal channels but
more commonly occur as the result of an extralegal executive decision. While they are often
temporary, the closures occasionally become permanent. They are frequently imposed in periods
of political or social tension, such as during election campaigns, protest movements, or outbreaks
of ethnic or religious violence.

For example, in November and December 2010, regulators in Egypt shut down or
otherwise censored a number of television stations based on complaints filed by the minister of
information or alleged violations of election guidelines.20 Four satellite television stations were
also closed in October for breaches of unspecified license terms.21 The Rwandan government
employed similar tactics prior to elections held in August 2010. In late July, the regulator
published a list of several dozen print and broadcast outlets that would be “recognized” by the
government, rendering approximately 30 others illegal, including several leading print outlets.
The banned publications and stations were then ordered to reapply for licenses, and those that
attempted to continue operating were seized.22 Two leading newspapers had already been
suspended in April for a six-month period—an extralegal decision that also seemed aimed at
curtailing independent coverage of the August election.

With the dramatic increase in broadcast media diversity and the growth of private outlets
in recent years, there has been a particular focus on obstructing live television news coverage and
live radio and television call-in shows in which hosts, guest commentators, and ordinary citizens
are able to express their views freely. Bans on or interference with such programming occurred
amid political tension and rioting in Uganda in September 2009, and during ethnic violence in
Kyrgyzstan in June 2010.23 A radio station in Zambia, which had already been banned from
hosting live call-in programs since 2007, was threatened with revocation of its license in
November 2010 due to allegations that it intended to host an opposition leader and discuss a
controversial topic. In January 2011, the station was raided and closed down after airing an
advertisement for a meeting on the same topic.24 In the majority of such incidents, the authorities
cite technical “irregularities” or violations of license terms, but the true aim appears to be halting
criticism of the government or unflattering live news coverage.

Arbitrary directives on content have been also been employed by regulators in certain
situations. For example, in June 2010, the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication
(HAAC) in Benin issued a blanket ban on all media coverage that could be described as
“premature” election campaigning until 15 days prior to the elections, which were not scheduled
to take place until 2011.25 The HAAC threatened to shut down or withdraw the license of any
outlet that violated this directive, despite protests from industry groups that the regulator was
overstepping its legal authority. A similar directive concerning coverage of campaigning
activities was announced by Côte d’Ivoire’s National Audiovisual Communication Council in
October 2010.

The state sometimes bypasses the legally mandated regulatory bodies entirely, with
executive or law enforcement agencies forcibly closing outlets on national security or some other
grounds. Authorities in Thailand used an emergency decree to shutter several dozen community
radio stations in July 2010, accusing presenters of fomenting political tension. The move
circumvented the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), which
supervises broadcast outlets.26 However, NBTC officials were involved in a court-ordered raid
on 13 stations that was orchestrated by the Internal Security Operations Command in April 2011.
The raid, in which 12 stations were shut down and several media personnel were arrested, was
prompted by the airing of a speech by an opposition political leader that was considered to be
defamatory toward the king.27

Other such instances have occurred in countries including Uganda and Pakistan. In The
Gambia, a radio station that was arbitrarily closed in January 2011 was able to reopen in
February after being offered a “second chance” by the president, whose office noted in a letter to
the station that it should desist from citing opposition newspapers in its popular news review and
current affairs program, and should only review news from government-controlled outlets.28 A
local judge in Argentina ordered the closure of a radio station in Santa Fe Province in April in
what appeared to be a politicized decision stemming from the station’s criticism of the local
mayor; the ruling bypassed the federal regulator and an established process for making
complaints.29 Arbitrary decisions by a mayor were also apparently behind the shutdowns of a
television and a radio station in western Venezuela in May 2011.

===Self-Regulation===

Self-regulation, as an alternative to statutory regulation, is acknowledged as the best-practice
model and is already used in dozens of countries, particularly those with freer media
environments. In a self-regulatory system, the media industry essentially polices itself through
bodies such as a nongovernmental media council or an ombudsman, which monitor compliance
with agreed-upon codes of conduct. Most self-regulatory bodies apply to print media, but in
some countries there are separate entities for broadcast media. Councils that cover all forms of
media are less common, but given the growth of media houses that encompass print, broadcast,
and internet outlets, this all-media format may expand in the future.

Ideally, self-regulatory bodies should enjoy broad acceptance and participation by the
media sector, and their leaders should for the most part be members of the profession who were
elected by their peers, supplemented by members of the public, retired judges, or other
independent actors. The entity would be empowered to hear cases brought against media outlets
or journalists by members of the public or government figures, and to adjudicate and direct
remedial action, which frequently takes the form of a published retraction or correction.30
Examples of such bodies include the Peruvian Press Council and the Media Council of Tanzania.

In some cases, the state tries to co-opt an existing self-regulatory process. A subtle bill
proposed in Panama in early 2010, for instance, would establish a national agency to “oversee”
self-regulatory agreements by setting norms, a move that regional press freedom watchdogs
decried as a distortion of the idea of self-regulation.31 Alternatively, the state may claim that an
existing system is ineffective and try to replace or eclipse it with some form of statutory
regulation, as with a government-proposed media tribunal currently under consideration in South
Africa. Most commonly, the reason given for such a course of action is that the existing
mechanism does not have sufficient teeth (in terms of punishments for violators) or is unable to
police irresponsible media outlets effectively.

In a number of other countries, self-regulatory mechanisms are undeveloped or extremely
weak, and the state is able to use this as an excuse to continue or introduce statutory regulation.
In Zambia, for instance, the media have made attempts to develop a self-regulatory mechanism
that encompasses both the entire private sector and the state-run outlets, but the effort faces an
ongoing threat from the government, which has sought to impose statutory regulation.32 In 2010,
a consortium of industry groups agreed to establish a self-regulatory body, the Zambia Media
Council (ZAMEC), and drafted a code of ethics that the council would help enforce. However,
due to a lack of official support—which would limit the participation of state media—the
launching of ZAMEC was repeatedly postponed. In early 2011, ZAMEC announced further
measures to strengthen its enforcement mechanisms amid continuing discussions with the
government on whether the public media would be involved in the process.33

Threats to self-regulatory mechanisms appear to be on the rise, according to a recent
report by the Center for International Media Assistance; media in a number of countries,
particularly in Africa, are facing stronger attempts to impose state-controlled regulation.34
However, in some cases this has spurred private media to adopt preemptive measures. In
Pakistan, the government’s moves to impose additional regulatory controls have led to concerted
action by the media industry to develop its own codes of conduct, for example on the topic of
broadcast coverage of terrorist events or violence. Looming threats of state-led regulation also
prompted the establishment of independent media councils in Britain in 1991 and Ireland in
2007.35

===Regulation of Networked and Foreign Media===

As a result of the internationalization of the media space, national regulatory systems are
affecting not just domestic outlets, but also international and regional broadcasters. For example,
in the wake of the disputed 2010 presidential election in Côte d’Ivoire, the regulator—on orders
from the government, led then by President Laurent Gbagbo—suspended local transmission of
all international radio and television news services, citing the potential for unrest. France’s Radio
France Internationale was also shut down in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for more
than a year in 2009, after the government accused it of demoralizing the army. The pan-Arab
satellite television station Al-Jazeera has fallen afoul of a number of governments in the Middle
East and North Africa, which have on various occasions withdrawn licenses and accreditation
from its correspondents and bureaus.36

However, a more globalized and diverse media environment, in which cable and satellite
stations compete with terrestrial broadcasters, has also allowed national outlets to evade
restrictive regulations by, for example, establishing their headquarters and transmission facilities
outside the home country, as some Pakistani stations have done in Dubai.

The proliferation of networked media platforms like the internet and mobile telephones
presents an added challenge for regulators. In some countries, regulatory laws and bodies cover
the media as well as telecommunications, while in others there are separate regulatory
frameworks for each. Moreover, legislation on broadcasting in a number of countries,
particularly those that transitioned to more open democratic systems in the 1990s and enacted the
relevant laws more than a decade ago, seem increasingly inadequate to handle the phenomenon
of convergence, in which media content is disseminated across multiple delivery systems. Best
practice concerning internet regulation is still evolving, with many advocates arguing that online
outlets, like newspapers, should be largely free of state-imposed restrictions.

Nevertheless, some governments have responded by simply extending the rules for
broadcast media—which tend to be more restrictive than those for print and other media—to
cover the internet. A December 2010 amendment to Venezuela’s the 2004 Law for Social
Responsibility in Radio, Television, and Electronic Media extended its restrictions to online
outlets, banning messages that incite or promote hatred, foment citizens’ anxiety, or disrespect
authorities, among other loosely written provisions. The amendment also placed internet media
under the purview of CONATEL, the government regulator, which now has the power to block
online content and issue fines to media outlets or internet-service providers that violate the law.
In May 2010, Azerbaijani authorities also expressed their intent to extend licensing controls over
the internet, and particularly over internet-based television channels, although such controls have
yet to come into force.

==CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS==

The state-run national media monopolies that prevailed in many parts of the world during the
20th century have become increasingly rare, as democratization, privatization processes, and new
technologies multiply the conduits for news and information. However, governments have found
ways to adapt their legal and regulatory systems to the new environment, allowing them to
maintain a measure of control over the dissemination of news on sensitive topics.

In countries that have fallen under authoritarian rule, such as Venezuela or Zimbabwe,
legal restrictions are widespread, regulatory bodies are under government control, and private
outlets face the threat of closure for airing opposition views. In a range of partly free media
environments, authorities use regulation more selectively, punishing certain outlets or restricting
content during crucial periods. Often there is a gap between the laws on the books and their
application in practice. Unfortunately, even the governments in very open countries have
displayed an impulse to improperly control information through regulation. Hungary recently
enacted its most severe licensing and content controls since the end of communist rule, and in
South Africa, which has been held up as an example of best practice in terms of its legal
framework and self-regulatory system, a government-proposed media tribunal threatens to erode
the country’s hard-won press freedom.

In response, advocates need to maintain monitoring efforts, report violations of
international standards, and continue to push for both the reform of restrictive laws and full
adherence to well-crafted ones. Particular attention should be paid to the licensing regime and
the legal underpinnings of a given regulatory body, to ensure that the regulator has the capacity
to operate independently and make transparent decisions based on clearly defined and reasonable
criteria. Drastic steps such as the suspension of a license or the closure of an outlet should be
considered within this framework, and should not come as the result of arbitrary actions by
security forces or the executive branch.

Supporters of media freedom must also work to develop or strengthen truly independent
self-regulatory mechanisms that have the backing of both private and public outlets. These
systems should address concerns about ethical lapses and professional standards so as to prevent
the enactment of excessively harsh statutory regulation on the same grounds.

Finally, advocates should encourage a comprehensive approach to the changing and
converging media environment that nevertheless recognizes the necessity of applying different
levels of regulation to different types of media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pathogens in water supplies and disinfection methods for drinking water are following.

===Pathogens in Water Supplies===
* '''Bacteria''' - Bacteria are very common single-celled microorganisms that generally exist in colonies and almost always exist in water supplies.  In fact, in waste-water treatment, the presence of bacteria is essential to the breakdown of chemical contaminants.

* '''Viruses''' - A virus is a sub-microscopic (less than one micrometer in size) infectious agent that is unable to grow or reproduce outside a host cell. Each viral particle, or virion, consists DNA or RNA, within a protective protein coat called a capsid. The capsid shape varies from simple helical and icosahedral (polyhedral or near-spherical) forms, to more complex structures with tails or an envelope. Viruses infect all cellular life forms and are grouped into animal, plant and bacterial types, according to the type of host infected.

* '''Protozoa'''
** [[W:Giardia|Giardia]] - ''Giardia lamblia'' is a protozoan that is considered a dangerous acute contaminant that commonly exists in water supplies.  Within the environment, it is usually present in its dormant form as a [[W:cyst|cyst]], a thick-walled stage within which it can survive transport to a new host through water.
** [[W:Cryptosporidium|Cryptosporidium]] - ''Cryptosporidium parva'' is a protozoan that is considered a highly dangerous acute contaminant that occasionally enters water supplies.  Within the environment, it is usually present as an [[W:cyst|cyst]] or [[W:spore|spore]], a hardy stage which it uses to survive transport to a new host.

===Disinfection of Pathogens in Water===
* '''Physical''' - Boiling or freezing water causes changes in phase and density which disrupt the ability of a pathogen to exist within the medium.  Cellular [[w:cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] (cellular bodily fluid) is mostly water and reacts to physical changes of its medium (human bodily fluids or water supplies).  Boiling a fluid into a gas causes a pressure increase that explodes cell membranes.  Freezing a fluid completely causes thermal expansion of water (e.g. ice occupying more volume than the equivalent amount of water), which also creates a pressure that bursts cellular membranes.

* '''Irradiation by Electromagnetic Rays''' - [[W:Electromagnetic waves|Electromagnetic waves]] (light) of a frequency higher than low ultraviolet (i.e. UV, X and Gamma bands) are considered [[W:ionizing radiation|ionizing radiation]] and may break chemical bonds holding a pathogen together.  In the case of microbial DNA, the double helix may be broken, thus inactivating the virus.  In the case of any ionizing radiation, the water may be ionized thus creating oxidative conditions.

* '''Bactericidal metal Ions''' - Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; have been well known to be effective disinfectants for millenia.  

* '''pH Adjustment through Strong Acids and Bases'''

* '''Surfactants''' - Quarternary Ammonium Compounds

* '''Chemical Oxidants''' - Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; and halo-organic compunds.

'''Solar water disinfection''', also known as '''SODIS'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sodis.ch/index_EN |title=SODIS - Safe drinking water in 6 hours |publisher=sodis.ch |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[w:disinfection|disinfecting]] water using only [[w:sunlight|sunlight]] and plastic [[w:polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles. SODIS is a free and effective method for decentralized [[w:water treatment|water treatment]], usually applied at the household level and is recommended by the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/household_water/en/ |title=Household water treatment and safe storage |publisher=[[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SODIS is already applied in numerous [[w:developing countries|developing countries]].

==Principle==
Exposure to sunlight has been shown to deactivate [[w:diarrhea|diarrhea]]-causing organisms in polluted [[w:drinking water|drinking water]]. Three effects of [[w:solar radiation|solar radiation]] are believed to contribute to the inactivation of pathogenic organisms:

* UV-A interferes directly with the metabolism and destroys cell structures of bacteria.
* [[w:Ultraviolet|UV]]-A (wavelength 320-400&amp;nbsp;nm) reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and [[w:hydrogen peroxide|hydrogen peroxides]]), that are believed to also damage pathogens.
* Cumulative solar energy (including the [[w:infrared radiation|infrared radiation]] component) heats the water. If the water temperatures rises above 50°C, the disinfection process is three times faster.

At a water temperature of about 30°C (86°F), a threshold solar radiation intensity of at least 500 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (all spectral light) is required for about 5 hours for SODIS to be efficient. This dose contains energy of 555 Wh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the range of UV-A and violet light, 350&amp;nbsp;nm-450&amp;nbsp;nm, corresponding to about 6 hours of mid-latitude (European) midday summer sunshine.

At water temperatures higher than 45°C (113°F), synergistic effects of UV radiation and temperature further enhance the disinfection efficiency.

== Process for household application ==

[[Image:Pictograms SODIS.jpg|800px|]]
[[File:U+2673 DejaVu Sans.svg|thumb|right|PET recycling mark]]

* Colourless, transparent [[w:polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] water or pop bottles (2 litre or smaller size) with few surface scratches are chosen for use. The labels are removed and the bottles are washed before the first use.
* Water from contaminated sources are filled into the bottles. To improve oxygen saturation, bottles can be filled three quarters, shaken for 20 seconds (with the cap on), then filled completely and recapped. Very cloudy water with a turbidity higher than 30 [[w:Nephelometric Turbidity Unit|NTU]] must be filtered prior to exposure to the sunlight.
* Filled bottles are then exposed to the sun. Bottles will heat faster and to higher temperatures if they are placed on a sloped sun-facing corrugated metal roof as compared to thatched roofs.
* The treated water can be consumed directly from the bottle or poured into clean drinking cups. The risk of re-contamination is minimized if the water is stored in the bottles. Refilling and storage in other containers increases the risk of contamination.

==Applications==

SODIS is an effective method for treating water where fuel or cookers are unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Even where fuel is available, SODIS is a more economical and environmentally friendly option. The application of SODIS is limited if enough bottles are not available, or if the water is highly [[w:turbid|turbid]].In fact, if the water is highly turbid, SODIS can not be used alone, additional filtering is then necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepis.org.pe/cursodesastres/diplomado/pdf/SODIS.pdf Limitations of SODIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the method could be used in disaster relief or refugee camps. However, supplying bottles may be more difficult than providing equivalent disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or metal containers in which water can be boiled with fire.  Additionally, in some circumstances, it may be difficult to guarantee that the water will be left in the sun for the necessary time.

Other methods for household water treatment and safe storage exist, e.g. chlorination, different filtration procedures or flocculation/disinfection. The selection of the adequate method should be based on the criteria of effectiveness, the co-occurrence of other types of pollution (turbidity, chemical pollutants), treatment costs, labor input and convenience, and the user’s preference.

==Cautions==

If the water bottles are not left in the sun for the proper length of time, the water may not be safe to drink and could cause illness. If the sunlight is less strong, due to overcast weather or a less sunny climate, a longer exposure time in the sun is necessary. 

The following issues should also be considered:

* '''Bottle material:''' Some glass or PVC materials may prevent ultraviolet light from reaching the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5hmK5deXc |title=SODIS Technical Note # 2 Materials: Plastic versus Glass Bottles |format=PDF |publisher=sodis.ch |date=20 October 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available bottles made of  [[w:Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] are recommended. The handling is much more convenient in the case of PET bottles. [[w:Polycarbonate|Polycarbonate]] blocks all UVA and UVB rays, and therefore should not be used.

* '''Aging of plastic bottles:''' SODIS efficiency depends on the physical condition of the plastic bottles, with scratches and other signs of wear reducing the efficiency of SODIS. Heavily scratched or old, blind bottles should be replaced.
 
* '''Shape of containers:''' the intensity of the UV radiation decreases rapidly with increasing water depth. At a water depth of 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;inches) and moderate turbidity of 26 NTU, UV-A radiation is reduced to 50%. PET soft drink bottles are often easily available and thus most practical for the SODIS application.

* '''Oxygen:''' Sunlight produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides) in the water. These reactive molecules contribute in the destruction process of the microorganisms. Under normal conditions (rivers, creeks, wells, ponds, tap) water contains sufficient oxygen (more than 3&amp;nbsp;mg Oxygen per litre) and does not have to be aerated before the application of SODIS.

* '''Leaching of bottle material:''' There has been some concern over the question whether plastic drinking containers can release chemicals or toxic components into water, a process possibly accelerated by heat. The Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research have examined the diffusion of [[w:adipate|adipates]] and [[w:phthalates|phthalates]] (DEHA and [[w:DEHP|DEHP]]) from new and reused PET-bottles in the water during solar exposure. The levels of concentrations found in the water after a solar exposure of 17 hours in 60°C water were far below [[w:World Health Organization|WHO]] guidelines for drinking water and in the same magnitude as the concentrations of phthalate and adipate generally found in high quality tap water.&lt;br /&gt; Concerns about the general use of PET-bottles were also expressed after a report published by researchers from the University of Heidelberg on [[w:Polyethylene terephthalate#Antimony|antimony]] being released from PET-bottles for soft drinks and mineral water stored over several months in supermarkets.

==Health impact, diarrhea reduction==
[[Image:Mwamongu water source.jpg|right|thumb|Only forty-six percent of people in Africa have safe drinking water.]]
It has been shown that the SODIS method (and other methods of household water treatment) can very effectively remove pathogenic contamination from the water. However, infectious diseases are also transmitted through other pathways, i.e. due to a general lack of sanitation and hygiene. Studies on the reduction of diarrhea among SODIS users show reduction values of 30-80%.

==Research and development==

The effectiveness of the SODIS was first discovered by Professor Aftim Acra at the [[w:American University of Beirut|American University of Beirut]] in the early 1980s [3]. Substantial follow-up research was conducted by the research groups of [[w:Martin Wegelin|Martin Wegelin]] at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) and Dr [[w:Kevin McGuigan|Kevin McGuigan]] at the [[w:Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. Clinical control trials were pioneered by Professor Ronan Conroy of the RCSI team in collaboration with [[w:Michael Elmore-Meegan|Michael Elmore-Meegan]].

Currently, a joint research project on SODIS is implemented by the following institutions:
* Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), Ireland (coordination)
* University of Ulster (UU), United Kingdom
* CSIR Environmentek, South Africa, Eawag, Switzerland
* The Institute of Water and Sanitation Development (IWSD), Zimbabwe
* Plataforma Solar de Almería (CIEMAT-PSA), Spain
* University of Leicester (UL), United Kingdom
* The International Commission for the Relief of Suffering &amp; Starvation (ICROSS), Kenya
* University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), Spain
* Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Switzerland

The project has embarked on a multi-country study including study areas in [[w:Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]], [[w:South Africa|South Africa]] and [[w:Kenya|Kenya]].

Other developments include the development of a continuous flow disinfection unit&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14766599&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caslake LF, Connolly DJ, Menon V, Duncanson CM, Rojas R, Tavakoli J |title=Disinfection of contaminated water by using solar irradiation |journal=Appl.

== Issues to consider==
The following are some of the issues discussed in the literature:
* Local education in the use of SODIS is important to avoid confusion between PET and other bottle materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrainingEN&quot; /&gt;
* Applying SODIS without proper assessment (or with false assessment) of existing hygienic practices &amp; diarrhea incidence may not address other routes of infection. Community trainers need to themselves be trained first.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrainingEN&quot; /&gt;
* When the water is highly turbid, SODIS can not be used alone, additional filtering or flocculation is then necessary to clarify the water prior to SODIS treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/household_water/research/turbidity/en/ |title=Treating turbid water |publisher=[[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] |year=2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scaling&gt;{{cite book|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2009/WHO_HSE_WSH_09.02_eng.pdf |title=Scaling Up Household Water Treatment Among Low-Income Populations |publisher=World Health Organization |author=Clasen T |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide application==

The Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), through the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec), coordinates SODIS promotion projects in 33 countries including Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, DR Congo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Perú, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Togo, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Contact addresses and case studies of the projects coordinated by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) are available at [http://www.sodis.ch/ sodis.ch].

SODIS projects are funded by, among others, the SOLAQUA Foundation (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080504011759rn_1/www.wegelin.ch/who/solaqua.asp |archivedate=2008-05-04 |title=SOLAQUA |publisher=Wegelin &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), several [[w:Lions Clubs|Lions Clubs]], [[w:Rotary International|Rotary]] Clubs, [[w:Migros|Migros]], and the Michel Comte Water Foundation.

SODIS has also been applied in several communities in Brazil, one of them being Prainha do Canto Verde north of Fortaleza. There, the villagers have been purifying their water with the SODIS method. It is quite successful, especially since the temperature during the day can go beyond 40°C (100°F) and there is a limited amount of shade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Following is about '''water security''' and '''water scarcity'''. Water security is the capacity of a population to ensure that they continue to have access to [[w:potable water|potable water]]. It is an increasing concern arising from [[w:population growth|population growth]], [[w:drought|drought]], [[w:climate change|climate change]], oscillation between [[w:El Niño|El Niño]] and [[w:La Niña|La Niña]] effects, [[w:urbanisation|urbanisation]], [[w:salinity|salinity]], upstream [[w:pollution|pollution]], over-allocation of [[w:water licences|water licences]] by government agencies and over-utilisation of [[w:groundwater|groundwater]] from [[w:artesian basin|artesian basin]]. Water security is rapidly declining in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119047944/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Retrieved 2009-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[w:Pacific Institute|Pacific Institute]] &quot;While regional impacts will vary, global climate change will potentially alter agricultural productivity, freshwater availability and quality, access to vital minerals, coastal and island flooding, and more. Among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships, realignment of energy markets and regional economies, and threats to security&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacinst.org/topics/global_change/climate_security/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Water security is sometimes sought by implementing [[w:water desalination|water desalination]], [[w:Pipeline transport|pipelines]] between sources and users, water licences with different security levels and [[w:war|war]].

== Causes of water stress ==
The concepts of water stress and water scarcity are relatively new. Fifty years ago, when there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. People were not as wealthy then as they are today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense. This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops.

The total amount of available freshwater supply is also decreasing because of climate change, which has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic==
[[w:Economic water scarcity|Economic water scarcity]], meanwhile, is caused by a lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Symptoms of economic water scarcity include a lack of infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure there could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |title=Learn More: Water Scarcity
  |publisher=[[w:Columbia Water Center]]
  |author=
  |date=
  |accessdate=2009-09-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 2.8 billion people currently live in water-scarce areas, as defined by this method.
Water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Patrick Webb]] and Maria Iskandarani, Water Insecurity and the Poor: Issues and Research Needs. http://www.zef.de/fileadmin/webfiles/downloads/zef_dp/zef_dp2-98.pdf, Center for Development Research, Discussion Papers on Development Policy No. 2, Bonn, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
A popular approach has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm
  |title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
  |publisher=[[w:UNEP]]
  |author=Falkenmark and Lindh 1976, quoted in UNEP/WMO
  |date=
  |accessdate=2009-02-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a country or region is said to experience &quot;water stress&quot; when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces &quot;water scarcity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/LARSENST/
  |title=Lack of Freshwater Throughout the World
  |publisher=[[w:Evergreen State College]]
  |author=Samuel T. L. Larsen
  |date=
  |accessdate=2009-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unitied Nations' [[w:FAO|FAO]] states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/issues/scarcity.html FAO Hot issues: Water scarcity]&lt;/ref&gt;
Water stress is considered &quot;set to become a permanent feature of British life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-75.html|title=Hosepipes, history and a sustainable future|last=Vanessa Taylor and Frank Trentmann|date=July 2008|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|language=[[w:English language|English]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[w:United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi  World Bank] adds that [[w:climate change|climate change]] could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use,thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=21–24 |accessdate=2011-24-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;, aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into ‘physical’ and ‘economic’. [[w:Physical water scarcity|Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is over-development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. 

==Water crises==
A '''water crisis''' is a situation where the available [[w:potable water|potable]], [[w:water pollution|unpolluted water]] within a region is less than that region's demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleandplanet.net/doc.php%3Fid=671&amp;section=14.html Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises such that it is a global concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17551&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1 |title=United Nations statement on water crisis |publisher=Un.org |date=2006-02-20 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/international/summit/summit3.asp UN World Summit on Sustainable Development addresses the water crisis]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations, such as the [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]], argue that there is no water crises in such places, but that steps must still be taken to avoid one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html &quot;No global water crisis - but may developing countries will face water scarcity&quot;], FAO.org 12 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply, but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity. 

A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis, saying &quot;There is enough water for everyone&quot; and &quot;Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Fredrik Segerfeldt]] (2005), [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4462 &quot;Private Water Saves Lives&quot;], ''Financial Times'' 25 August&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Zetland, [http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/running-out-of-water.html &quot;Running Out of Water&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Zetland, [http://aguanomics.com/2008/07/water-crisis.html &quot;Water Crisis&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources. [[w:Marsh|marshes]], [[w:bog|bogs]] and [[w:riparian zone|riparians]] are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[w:wetland|wetlands]] were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a “[[w:no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]” of wetlands.

In [[w:Europe|Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting loss of biodiversity. For example many bogs in [[w:Scotland|Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[w:Portlethen Moss|Portlethen Moss]] in [[w:Aberdeenshire|Aberdeenshire]].

On [[w:Madagascar|Madagascar]]’s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[w:slash and burn|slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country’s native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[w:overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that “run red” decades after the [[w:deforestation|deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[w:coral reef|coral reef]] formations in the [[w:Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.

In October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.

===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===

There are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[w:human|human]] [[w:health|health]] and inadequate drinking water. The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations (numerical population of affected population listed) whose only consumption is of contaminated water:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[w:Venezuela|Venezuela]] 5.0 million
* [[w:Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] 2.7 million

Several world maps showing various aspects of the problem can be found in this [http://environment.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2670/26700101.jpg graph] article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html &quot;Looming water crisis simply a management problem&quot;] by [[w:Jonathan Chenoweth|]], [[w:New Scientist|]] 28 Aug., 2008, pp. 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[w:California Department of Resources|California Department of Resources]], if more supplies aren’t found by 2020, the region will face a shortfall nearly as great as the amount consumed today. [[w:Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] is a coastal desert able to support at most 1 million people on its own water; the Los Angeles basin now is the core of a [[w:megacity|megacity]] that spans {{convert|220|mi|km|-1}} from [[w:Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to the [[w:Mexican border|Mexican border]]. The region’s population is expected to reach 41 million by 2020, up from 28 million in 2009. The population of California continues to grow by more than two million a year and is expected to reach 75 million in 2030, up from 49 million in 2009. But water shortage is likely to surface well before then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecenters19af |title=U.S. Water Supply |publisher=Fairus.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[w:Chinese water crisis|China]] and [[w:India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jul 21, 2006 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include [[w:Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[w:Iran|Iran]], and [[w:Mexico|Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[w:aquifers|aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |title=Water Scarcity Crossing National Borders |publisher=Earth-policy.org |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatlakesdirectory.org/zarticles/080902_water_shortages.htm Water Shortages May Cause Food Shortages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20070819122845423 Yemen's Capital Facing Water Shortage Due to Rapid Increase in Population]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits&amp;nbsp;— [[w:Algeria|Algeria]], [[w:Egypt|Egypt]], [[w:Iran|Iran]], Mexico, and Pakistan. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. But with a population expanding by 4 million a year, it will also likely soon turn to the world market for grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-sis.org.uk/TFBE.php |title=The Food Bubble Economy |publisher=I-sis.org.uk |date=2002-04-12 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Sub-Saharan Africa|Subsaharan]] region of africa had the largest number of water-stressed countries of any other place on the globe. In Africa, the struggle for access to clean [[w:drinking water|drinking water]] is one of today's most obvious examples of how water scarcity leads to the stalling and reversal of human progress. While each individual living in the United States uses on average 100 to 175 gallons of water per day in the home, the average African family uses only 5 gallons of water per day.
&lt;ref name=&quot;bpn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts About The Global Drinking Water Crisis|url=http://blueplanetnetwork.org/water/facts|year=2010|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This vast disparity of clean water availability and consumption is reflected in a number of different developmental aspects. These consequences include the effects on health, opportunities for women, [[w:Education in Africa|children's education]], agricultural practices, regional conflict, and productivity and [[w:International development|development]].

== Impact on development ==
=== Health ===
The most immediately apparent impact of water scarcity in Africa is on the continent's health. Infants and children are especially susceptible to these diseases because of their inexperienced immune systems,&lt;ref name=&quot;WS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Scarcity: The Importance of Water &amp; Access|url=http://thewaterproject.org/water_scarcity.asp|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which lends to elevated [[w:infant mortality|infant mortality]] rates in many regions of Africa.

When infected with these waterborne diseases, those living in African communities suffering from water scarcity cannot contribute to the community’s productivity and development because of a simple lack of strength. Additionally, economic resources are sapped by the cost of medicine to treat waterborne diseases, which takes away from resources that might have been used for food or school fees.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;
This also takes a toll on the governmental funds. The [[w:Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council|Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] (WSSCC) estimates that in [[w:Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa]], treatment of diarrhea due to [[w:Water pollution|water contamination]] consumes 12 percent of the country’s health budget. With better water conditions, the burden on healthcare would be less substantial and a healthier workforce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rural Transformation in Tropical Africa|year=1988|publisher=Belhaven Press|location=Great Britain|author=Sandy Cairncross|editor=Douglas Rimmer|pages=49–54|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would stimulate economic growth and pull many people out of poverty.

=== Women, children, and education ===
African women are disproportionally burdened by scarcity of clean drinking water. In most African societies, women are seen as the collectors, managers, and guardians of water, especially within the domestic sphere that includes household chores, cooking, washing, and child rearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Water Scarcity on Women's Life|url=http://www.worldpulse.com/node/20165|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these traditional [[w:Gender role|gender labor roles]], women are forced to spend around sixty percent of each day collecting water, which translates to approximately 200 million collective work hours by women globally per day.&lt;ref name=wac&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Affected by the Crisis|url=http://water.org/learn-about-the-water-crisis/women|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For African women, this often means carrying the typical [[w:jerrycan|jerrycan]] that can weigh over 40 pounds when full&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; for an average of six kilometers each day.&lt;ref name=bpn/&gt; As a result of this, many women are unable to hold professional employment.

Additionally, this prevents many young girls from attending school and receiving an education. They are expected to not only aid their mothers in water retrieval, but to also help with the demands of household chores that are made more time-intensive because of a lack of readily available water. Furthermore, a lack of clean water means the absence of sanitary facilities and latrines in schools, and so once puberty hits, this has the largest impact on female children. In terms of lost educational opportunity, if adequate investment were made in drinking water and sanitation, it is estimated that it would result in 272 million more school attendance days per year.&lt;ref name=wac /&gt; This lost number of potential school days and education results in the hindrance of the next generation’s African females from breaking out of the cycle of unequal opportunity for gainful employment. Because of this, available clean water for women and children translates to Africans with potential for education, prosperity, power, literacy, hygiene, security, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women for Water|url=http://womenforwater.com|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
The majority of Africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and so water scarcity translates to a loss of [[w:food security|food security]]. At this point, the majority of rural African communities are not tapping into their [[w:irrigation|irrigation]] potential, and according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa and New Partnership for Africa’s Development, &quot;irrigation is key to achieving increased agricultural production that is important for economic development and for attaining food security&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;uneca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Options to Enhance Survival and Growth|url=http://www.uneca.org/awich/Water%20in%20Africa.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for many regions, there is a lack of financial and human resources to support infrastructure and technology required for proper crop irrigation. Because of this, the impact of droughts, floods, and [[w:desertification|desertification]] is greater in terms of both African economic loss and human life loss due to crop failure and starvation. Additionally, lack of water causes many Africans to use wastewater for crop growth, then causing a large number of people to consume foods that can contain chemicals or disease-causing organisms transferred by the wastewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Facts About Water Scarcity|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/water/en/|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the extremely high number of African areas suffering from water scarcity issues, investing in development means sustainably withdrawing from clean freshwater sources, ensuring food security by expanding irrigation areas, and effectively managing the effects of [[w:climate change|climate change]].&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt;

=== Conflict ===
The explosion of populations in developing nations within Africa combined with climate change is causing extreme strain within and between nations. In the past, countries have worked to resolve water tensions through negotiation, but there is predicted to be an escalation in [[w:Water conflict|aggression over water accessibility]]. Federal intelligence agencies have issued the joint judgment that in the next ten years, water issues are not likely to cause internal and external tensions to intensify to war, but after 2022 there is expected to be a change.&lt;ref name=usi&gt;{{cite web|title=US Intel: Water a Cause for War in Coming Decades|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_20230354/us-intel-water-cause-war-coming-decades?IADID=Search-www.twincities.com-www.twincities.com|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the classified [[w:National Intelligence Estimate|National Intelligence Estimate]] on water security, requested by Secretary of State [[w:Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] and completed in Fall 2011, after 2022 water will be more likely to be used as a weapon of war and potential tool for terrorism, especially in [[w:North Africa]].&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; On [[w:World Water Day|World Water Day]], the [[w:State Department|State Department]] stated that water stress, &quot;will likely increase the risk of instability and state failure, exacerbate regional tensions and distract countries from working with the United States on important policy objectives.&quot; Specifically referring to the [[w:Nile|Nile]] in Egypt, Sudan, and nations further south, the report predicts that upstream nations will limit access to water for political reasons, and that terrorists may target water related infrastructures, such as reservoirs and dams, more frequently.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; Because of this, the [[w:World Economic Forum|World Economic Forum]]'s 2011 Global Risk Report has included water as one of the world’s top five risks for the first time.

=== Productivity and development ===
Poverty is directly related to the accessibility of clean drinking water- without it, the chances of breaking out of the [[w:poverty trap|poverty trap]] is extremely slim. The social and economic consequences of a lack of clean water penetrate into realms of education, opportunities for gainful employment, physical strength and health, agricultural and industrial development, and thus the overall [[w:Productivity|productive potential]] of a community, nation, and/or region. Because of this, the UN estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa alone loses 40 billion potential work hours per year collecting water.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; Because of this, the [[w:United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme]] estimated that in Africa, every dollar spent on water and sanitation generates a nine-fold return in saved time, increased productivity and reduced health cost.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Reasons for scarcity==
===Climate change===
According to the Africa Partnership Forum, “Although Africa is the continent least responsible for [[climate change|climate change]], it is particularly vulnerable to the effects,” and the long-term impacts include, “changing rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and reducing food security; worsening water security; decreasing fish resources in large lakes due to rising temperature; shifting vector-borne diseases; rising sea level affecting low-lying costal areas with large populations; and rising water stress”.&lt;ref name=cca&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Africa|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/7/38897900.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Africa’s dependence on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty, and weak capacity, the water issues caused by climate change impact the continent much more violently compared to developed nations that have the resources and economic diversity to deal with such global changes. The [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reports that climate change in Africa has manifested itself in more intense and longer droughts in the [[w:subtropics|subtropics]] and [[w:tropics|tropics]], while arid or semi-arid areas in northern, western, eastern, and parts of southern Africa are becoming drier and more susceptible to variability of precipitation and storms.&lt;ref name=cca/&gt; Overall this means that water stress caused by changing amounts of precipitation is particularly damaging to Africa and thus climate change is one of the major obstacles the continent must face when trying to secure reliable and clean sources of water.

=== Physical scarcity and economic scarcity ===
Water scarcity is both a natural and human-made phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action: Water for Life 2005-2015|url=http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus essential to break it down into two general types: Economic scarcity and physical scarcity. Economic scarcity refers to the fact that finding a reliable source of safe water is time consuming and expensive. Alternatively, physical scarcity is when there simply is not enough water.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

The 2006 [[w:United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] estimates that 300 million out of the 800 million who live on the African continent live in a water-scarce environment.&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; Specifically in the very north of Africa, as well the very south of Africa, the rising global temperatures accompanying climate change have intensified the [[w:hydrological cycle|hydrological cycle]] that leads to dryer dry seasons, thus increasing the risk of more extreme and frequent droughts. This significantly impacts the availability, quality and quantity of water due to reduced river flows and reservoir storage, lowering of water tables and drying up of aquifers in the northern and southern regions of Africa. 

The majority of Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from economic scarcity that exists because of population’s lack of the necessary monetary means to utilize adequate sources of water. Both political reasons and ethnic conflict have contributed to this unequal distribution of resources. Out of the two forms of water scarcity, economic scarcity can be addressed quickly and effectively with simple infrastructure to collect rainwater from roofs and dams, but this requires economic resources that many of these areas lack due to an absence of industrial development and widespread poverty.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

== Addressing the issue ==
===International efforts===
To adequately address the issue of water scarcity in Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa emphasizes the need to invest in the development of Africa’s potential water resources to reduce unnecessary suffering, ensure [[w:food security|food security]], and protect economic gains by effectively managing droughts, floods, and [[w:desertification|desertification]].&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; Some suggested and on going efforts to achieve this include digging wells, rainwater harvesting, and building clean-water catchment and storage tanks. 

===Non-governmental organizations' efforts===
In addition to the role the United States, the United Nations, and international governmental aid are all playing in helping bring clean water to water stressed regions of Africa, a number of NGOs have formed water charities to work towards that same goal of providing clean water for the continent by 2015. These charities are based on individual and group donations, which are then invested in a variety of methods and technologies to bring clean water to regions in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Charities:A Comprehensive List|url=http://www.filtersfast.com/articles/Water-Charities-A-Comprehensive-List.php|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable NGOs working towards this goal include, but are not limited to:

===Solutions and technologies===
The more basic solutions to help provide Africa with drinkable and usable water include well-digging, rain catchment systems, de-worming pills, and hand pumps, but high demand for clean water solutions has also prompted the development of some key creative solutions as well. 

Some non-profit organizations have focused on the aspect of drinking water contamination against [[w:sewage|sewage]] waste by installing cost-effective and relatively maintenance-free toilets, such as Drop In The Bucket’s “Eco-sanitation Flush Toilet” &lt;ref name=Drop/&gt; or [[w:Pump Aid|Pump Aid]]’s “Elephant Toilet”.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; The Elephant Toilet uses community-sourced resources in construction to build a relatively simple waste disposal mechanism that separates solids from liquids to promote faster decomposition and lower the impact on ground water.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; In comparison, the Eco-Sanitation Flush Toilet also uses no power of any kind, but actually treats sewage rather than just storing it so that the toilet’s output is only water.&lt;ref name=Drop/&gt; Both solutions are then simple for residents of African communities to maintain and have a notable impact on the cleanliness of local water sources.  

Overall, a wide range of cost-effective, manageable, and innovative solutions are available to help aid Africa in producing clean, disease-free water. Ultimately what it comes down to is using [[w:Appropriate Technology|technology appropriate]] for each individual community’s needs. For the technology to be effective, it must conform to environmental, ethical, cultural, social, and economic aspects of each Africa community.&lt;ref name=LI/&gt; If this can be done, with sufficient funding and aid to implement such technologies, it is feasible to eliminate clean water scarcity for the African continent by the [[w:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] deadline of 2015.

=== Limitations ===
Africa is home to both the largest number of water-scarce countries out of any region, as well as home to the most difficult countries to reach in terms of water aid. The prevalence of rural villages traps many areas in what the [[w:United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|UN Economic Commission for Africa]] refers to as the &quot;Harvesting Stage&quot;,&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; which makes water-scarce regions difficult to aid because of a lack of industrial technology to make solutions sustainable. In addition to the geographic and developmental limiting factors, a number of political, economic reasons also stand in the way of ensuring adequate aid for Africa. Politically, tensions between local governments versus foreign non-governmental organizations impact the ability to successfully bring in money and aid-workers. Economically, urban areas suffer from extreme [[w:Economic inequality|wealth gaps]] in which the overwhelming poor often pay four to ten times more for sanitary water than the elite, hindering the poor from gaining access to clean water technologies and efforts.&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; As a result of all these factors, it is estimated that fifty percent of all water projects fail, less than five percent of projects are visited, and less than one percent have any long-term monitoring.&lt;ref name=wac /&gt;

'''[[w:Water security|Water security]] in Australia''' has become a major concern over the course of the late 20th and early 21st century as a result of [[w:population growth|population growth]], severe [[w:drought in Australia|drought]], fears of the [[w:effects of global warming on Australia|effects of global warming on Australia]], [[w:environmental degradation|environmental degradation]] from reduced [[w:environmental flows|environmental flows]], competition between competing interests such as [[w:grazing|grazing]], [[w:Irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] and urban [[w:water supply|water supplies]], and competition between upstream and downstream users.

Water reform was first placed on the national agenda at the 1994 [[w:Council of Australian Governments|Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG) meeting when a strategic framework was devised.
&lt;ref name=&quot;mwa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Managing water for Australia:the social and institutional challenges |last1=Stoeckel |first1=Kate |last2=Abrahams |first2=Harry |editor1-first=Karen |editor1-last=Hussey |editor2-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Dovers |year=2007 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, Victoria |isbn=978-0-643-09392-8 |pages=2—6 |chapter=Water Reform in Australia:the National Water Initiative and the role of the National Water Commission  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the knowledge of surface and groundwater systems grew and the awareness of the significance of sustainable water markets increased, further water reform was agreed to at the 2004 COAG meeting, under a national blueprint known as the National Water Initiative (NWI).

Australia can be divided into 12 major drainage divisions. For example, the Murray-Darling drainage division consists of the Murray River basin and the Darling River basin. Three of these drainage division account for 87% of the water that Australia consumes – the North East Coast division, the South East Coast division, and the Murray-Darling. This means that the supply of water within Australia is highly concentrated, and any defect to one of these major water divisions can cause major water security issues.

==Privatisation of water==
{{Main|w:Water privatisation}}

Since the turn of the 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a privatised water market in Australia, with the state of [[w:Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] acting as a model for other states. Many political parties, community groups, NGO's and other groups and people see the privatisation of water as a denial of basic human rights on behalf of State and Federal Governments {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Water privatisation is a highly controversial topic and touches on the much broader arguments for and against the private control of formerly public services.

==Boundaries to water security==

A major boundary which affects effective water management is the highly variable precipitation levels of Australia – Australian rainfall is more variable than rainfall in rest of the world since it is driven by the [[w:Southern Oscillation|Southern Oscillation]] rather than by seasonal changes.
&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared (2005). ''Collapse'', p. 384. Penguin Books, London. ISBN 0-670-03337-5&lt;/ref&gt;
The result is that for the same level of reliability of supply, dams in Australia need to be six times as large as those in Europe and twice as large as the world average to ensure water sources do not run dry during dry seasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

==Competition for water==
===Competition between states===
In Australia there is competition for the resources of the [[w:Darling River|Darling River]] system between [[w:Queensland|Queensland]], New South Wales and South Australia. Similarly there is competition for the resources of the [[w:Murray River|Murray River]] between NSW, Victoria and South Australia. The South Australian government established a new ministerial portfolio of Water Security as the water security issues facing South Australia and the Lower Lakes and [[w:Coorong|Coorong]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;(February 2007).

===Competition between uses===
In the [[w:Macquarie Marshes|Macquarie Marshes]] of NSW [[w:grazing|grazing]] and [[w:irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] interests compete for water flowing to the marshes which would otherwise support the environment. There have been a series of embankments built to channel water flowing towards the marshes to privately held commercial interests. Some of these works are thought to have been done illegally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jennifermarohasy.com/blog/2007/07/stealing-water-from-the-macquarie-marshes-a-note-and-more-pictures-from-chris-hogendyk/ Stealing Water from the Macquarie Marshes: A Note and More Pictures from Chris Hogendyk].

===Competition for environmental flows===
The [[w:Snowy Mountains Scheme|Snowy Mountains Scheme]] diverted water from the [[w:Snowy River|Snowy River]] to the [[w:Murray River|Murray River]] and the [[w:Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee River]] for the benefit of irrigators and electricity generation through [[w:hydro-electric power|hydro-electric power]]. During recent years government has taken action to increase [[w:environmental flows|environmental flows]] to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the [[w:Murray-Darling Basin|Murray-Darling Basin]]. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows.

The South Australian government expects to have a desalination plant operating at [[w:Port Stanvac|Port Stanvac]] near [[w:Lonsdale, South Australia|South Australia]] by July 2011 with completion due in December 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;sawb&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/added-cost-of-green-desal-hits-homes/story-e6frea6u-1226051749544 |title=SA Water bills to go up by $135 a year |author=Brad Crouch |accessdate=9 May 2011 |date=8 May 2011 |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
The Victorian state government plans several major construction projects to be completed as Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs), in an effort to link state water supplies. These projects are designed to establish a state-wide water market in preparation of the privatisation of Victoria's water.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
The works include a $3.1&amp;nbsp;billion desalination plant to be built near [[w:Wonthaggi|Wonthaggi]] by the end of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbournewater.com.au/content/current_projects/water_supply/seawater_desalination_plant/seawater_desalination_plant.asp?bhjs=0 Desalination Plant : Projects]. Melbourne Water. Retrieved on 20 January 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; the North-South pipeline to connect water supplies from the [[w:Goulburn Valley|Goulburn Valley]] to Melbourne and [[w:Central Victoria|Central Victoria]], and an interconnector pipeline connecting the Geelong-Ballarat region.

Many argue that in privatising Victoria's water resources and creating a market to trade water between regions, the State Government is divesting itself from its core [[w:Water rights|human rights responsibilities]] to ensure [[w:potable water|potable water]] to the population it represents. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
This would come at great environmental cost, increase energy usage, decrease efficiency, ignore sustainable water management options and increase end-user water costs, placing water privatisation as a high risk to water security in Victoria, despite its acceptance by the state government.

===Queensland===
The Queensland government has developed the [[w:SEQ Water Grid|SEQ Water Grid]], to enhance the state's water security with the [[w:Western Corridor Recycled Water Project|Western Corridor Recycled Water Project]] being a key part. The [[w:Gold Coast desalination project|Gold Coast desalination plant]] which has been built at [[w:Tugun|Tugun]] on the [[w:Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], is another project that supplies water to markets in the [[w:South East Queensland|South East Queensland]] region. The Queensland government investigated the possibility of building a pipeline from the [[w:Northern Rivers|Northern Rivers]] of New South Wales to South East Queensland to facilitate water trade between these regions.

==Major initiatives for increased rural water security==
===Murray Darling Basin===
The [[w:Snowy Mountains Scheme|Snowy Mountains Scheme]] increased water security to properties near the [[w:Murray River|Murray River]] and [[w:Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee River]] during the 1960s and 70s. Overallocation of water licences and prolonged severe drought affecting snowfalls have undermined that security in the early 21st century.
===Ord River Scheme===
The [[w:Ord River|Ord River]] Irrigation Scheme (ORIS)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ord&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/water/overview/wa/basin-ord-river.html|title=Water resources – Overview – Western Australia – Drainage Basin: Ord River|work=Australian Natural Resources Atlas|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in the [[w:Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of Western Australia created [[w:Lake Argyle|Lake Argyle]], Australia's largest lake. ORIS provides water for irrigation to over 117&amp;nbsp;km² of farmland and there are plans to extend the scheme to allow irrigation of 440&amp;nbsp;km² in the future.

==Areas with critical water shortages==
===NSW===
====Lachlan River valley====
On 24 October 2009 the [[w:Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] reported that the [[w:Lachlan River|Lachlan River]] would stop flowing west of [[w:Condobolin, New South Wales|Condobolin]] within weeks as flows are slashed to keep only part of the river flowing, that the [[w:Wyangala Dam|Wyangala Dam]] could be empty by mid summer (15 January 2010) and that thousands of households will need to have water trucked to them. This situation follows 8 years of drought. Farmers in the area of the Lachlan Valley where the river will not flow are deeply concerned for the viability of their farms. More than 100,000 people live in the total Lachlan catchment. 14% of NSW agricultural production is generated in the region from a land area of approximately 10% of NSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/water-crisis-in-west-as-lachlan-river-runs-dry-20091023-hdce.html|title=Water crisis in west as Lachlan River runs dry|last=Cubby|first=Ben|coauthors=Marian Wilkinson|date=24 Oct 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===South Australia===
====The Coorong====
The Coorong's future is in doubt because of low flows of water reaching the mouth of the Murray River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/15/2686487.htm|title=Basin plan 'to determine' Coorong, lower lakes future|date=15 September 2009|publisher=ABC News Australia|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Acid sulphate soils are being exposed as water levels drop in the Doorong and nearby lakes, adding to the problems in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/sa-natural-icons-dying-from-thirst/780385.aspx|title=SA natural icons dying from thirst|last=Benger|first=Simon|date=30 May 2008|publisher=The Independent Weekly|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDT OligoAnalyzer Synbiota Plugin

'''Authors:'''
Fitzgerald Steele, Jr., Integrated DNA Technologies

'''What does the plugin do?'''

View oligo sequence Tm, Extinction Coefficient, Weight. Perform self-dimer analysis from Synbiota GENtle2. Of course, you can order the sequence from IDT.

Install it into GENTle2 like any other plugin (from the plugin menu). You can get it from the GitHub link:
https://github.com/fitzgeraldsteele/IDToligoanalyzer-synbiota-plugin

Highlight a sequence you want to anaylyze (up to 256 bases), then click Sequence &gt; IDT OligoAnalyzer. The plugin uses IDT's OligoAnalyzer web service to show you:

* Length
* Melting Temparature
* Extinction Coefficient
* GC% Content
* nmole/OD260
* ug/OD260
* Molecular Weight
* Self Dimer Analysis

We made some assumptions on the experimental conditions (0.25uM concentration, 50mM Na+ concentration, etc). Click the &quot;Open in OligoAnalyzer&quot; button to see even more detail, and customize the parameters to meet your experiment needs.

Of course, you can add it to your IDT shopping cart by clicking &quot;Order Oligos&quot;.

'''How does the plugin do it?'''

Makes use of the [http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/ IDT OligoAnalyzer] web service

'''Current issues:'''
Seems like the highlight animation is being triggered multiple times at the end of the ajax call.

=== Operator equation ===

The continuous Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator can be calculated explicitly for certain domains, such as a half-space, a ball and a cylinder and a shell with uniform conductivity ''1''. For example, for a unit ball in ''N''-dimensions, writing the Laplace equation in [[Wikipedia:Spherical coordinate system| spherical coordinates]] one gets:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f = r^{1-N}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{N-1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\right) + r^{-2}\Delta_{S^{N-1}}f, &lt;/math&gt;
and, therefore, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator satisfies the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\Lambda-(N-2)Id)+\Delta_{S^{N-1}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In two-dimensions the equation takes a particularly simple form:
: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2=-\Delta_{S^{1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The study of material of this chapter is largely motivated by the question of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington Gunther Uhlmann: &quot;Is there a discrete analog of the equation?&quot;

'''Exercise (**)''': Prove that for the unit ball the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator satisfies the quadratic equation above.

'''Exercise (*)''': Prove that for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of a half-space of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; with uniform conductivity ''1'',
: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2 = -\Delta_{R^{N-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Network case ===

To match the functional equation for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of the unit disc with conductivity ''1'', one needs to find a self-dual layered planar network with rotational symmetry. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for such graph ''G'' is equal to:

: &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^2_G = L, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''-L'' is equal to the Laplacian on the circle:

: &lt;math&gt;
L =
\begin{pmatrix}
 2     &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; -1 \\
 -1     &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; -1 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 \vdots    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
 -1     &amp; 0  &amp; \ldots &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise(*).''' Prove that the cofactor matrix for &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_G&lt;/math&gt; is constant ''1'' up to sign w/the chessboard pattern. 

The problem of finding the graph ''G'' then reduces to finding a Stieltjes [[Wikipedia:Continued fractions| continued fraction]] that is equal to ''1'' at the non-zero eigenvalues of ''L''. For the ''(2n+1)''-case, where ''n'' is a natural number, the eigenvalues are ''0'' with multiplicity ''1'' and
: &lt;math&gt; 2\sin(\frac{k\pi}{2n+1}), k = 1,2,\ldots n &lt;/math&gt;

with multiplicity ''2''. The existence and uniqueness of such fraction with ''n'' floors follows from our results on layered networks, see [BIMS].

'''Exercise (***).''' Prove that the continued fraction is given by the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\beta(z) = \cot(\frac{n\pi}{2n+1}) z + \cfrac{1}{\cot(\frac{(n-1)\pi}{2n+1})z + \cfrac{1}{ \ddots + \cfrac{1}{\cot(\frac{\pi}{2n+1}) z} }}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise 2 (*).''' Use the previous exercise to prove the trigonometric formula:

: &lt;math&gt;
\tan(\frac{n\pi}{2n+1}) = 2\sum_k\sin(\frac{k\pi}{2n+1}).
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise 3(**).''' Find the right signs in the following trigonometric formula

      <text xml:space="preserve">For an integer ''N'', let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be the ''N'''th root of unity, that is not equal to ''1''.
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^N = 1, \omega \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.
 
We consider the following symmetric '''[[Vandermonde matrix]]''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_N} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1     &amp; 1   &amp; \ldots &amp; 1 \\

 1 &amp; \omega^{(N-1) } &amp; \omega^{2(N-1)} &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega^{(N-1)^2} \\

&lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_5} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1         &amp; 1        &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\

 1     &amp; \omega^3  &amp; \omega^6 &amp; \omega^9 &amp; \omega^{12} \\
 1     &amp; \omega^4  &amp; \omega^8 &amp; \omega^{12} &amp; \omega^{16} \\
\end{bmatrix}
 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1         &amp; 1        &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 1     &amp; \omega    &amp; \omega^2 &amp; \omega^3 &amp; \omega^4 \\
 1     &amp; \omega^2  &amp; \omega^4 &amp; \omega &amp; \omega^3 \\
 1     &amp; \omega^3  &amp; \omega &amp; \omega^4 &amp; \omega^2 \\
 1     &amp; \omega^4  &amp; \omega^3 &amp; \omega^2 &amp; \omega \\
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The square of the Fourier transform is the flip permutation matrix: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^2 = \mathbf{P}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following rational approximation problem demonstrates how fast the considered discrete models converge to their continuous analogs. The problem of optimal rational approximation of the square root on an interval was solved by Russian mathematician Zolotarev with the closed form solutions in terms of '''[[Wikipedia:elliptic integral| elliptic integrals]]''', see [DIK] &amp; [PP].

The elliptic function 

: &lt;math&gt;
\xi = sn(u,k)
&lt;/math&gt;

can be defined by the following integral equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
u = \int^{\xi}_0\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(1-t^2)(1-\kappa^2t^2)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let 

:&lt;math&gt;
0 &lt; \kappa &lt; 1 \mbox{ and } \kappa' = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The optimal rational approximation function of order ''(k-1,k)''.

: &lt;math&gt;
||1-\sqrt{\lambda}\tilde{r}(\lambda)||_{C[1,1/\kappa'^2]} = inf \{||1-\sqrt{\lambda}{r}(\lambda)||_{C[1,1/\kappa'^2]}, r \in R_{k-1,k}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\tilde{r}(\lambda) = c\frac{\prod_{l=1}^{k-1}(\lambda+c_{2l})}{\prod_{l=1}^{k}(\lambda+c_{2l-1})},
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
c_l = \frac{sn^2(lk/(2K),\kappa)}{1-sn^2(lk/(2K),\kappa)}, l = 1,2,\ldots,2k-1.
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
K = \int^{1}_0\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(1-t^2)(1-\kappa^2t^2)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (**).''' Use the interlacing of zeros property to prove that the function
 
:&lt;math&gt;
s(\lambda) = \lambda\tilde{r}(\lambda^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

can be written as a Stieltjes continued fraction.

The optimal approximation converges exponentially fast with the the degree of the rational function.

The effective conductivities b/w boundary nodes and the [[Dirichlet-to-Neumann]] operator of a network are invariant under the following '''star-mesh''' and '''[[Y-Δ transform]]''', illustrated by the following drawings from Wikipedia:

[[File:Star-mesh transform.svg|thumbnail| Star-mesh transform ]]

'''Exercise (**)'''. Let ''d'' be a diagonal entry of the [[Kirchhoff matrix]] ''K'' of a network ''G'', corresponding to an interior node. Use the [[Schur complement]] formula 

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda(G) = K/C = (K/d)/(C/d) 
&lt;/math&gt;

for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator to prove the invariance.

The rules for replacing conductors in series or parallel connection by a single electrically equivalent conductor follow from the invariance property of the Y-Δ transform and can be viewed as its special cases, as also erasing an edge w/an end point of degree ''1'' and erasing an edge, which endpoints coincide. 

The ''Y-Δ'' transform is a special case of the star-mesh transform in which the center node has the degree ''3''.

The pulse is a precise instrument for transmitting signals about the organism of which it is a part. &lt;ref&gt;Leon Hammer, M.D. &quot;Chinese Pulse Diagnosis, A Contemporary Approach&quot;, Revised Edition, Page 33. EastLand Press, Seattle, 2005. ISBN: 0-939616-49-1 &lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pulse And Chinese Physiology==

===Paradox as a sign of illness===

===Positive and negative signs===
The pulse record can tell us our strengths. Intact proximal positions of the lower burner tell us that we are rooted and have ground to stand on. Intact middle positions of the middle burner tell us that we can restore and cleanse ourselves. Intact distal positions of the upper burner tell us that we can reach out to the world with awareness of our creative being, and to maintain mental and emotional stability.

An accurate pulse record is a precise and faithful catalog of a person's physiology and pathology at a given moment in life. It is the royal road to early diagnosis and prevention.

==The Pulse And Western Physiology==

==Large Segment And Small Segment Pulse Signs==

===Large Segments===

===Small Segments===

==Quantity vs. Quality==

==Conditions And Circumstances That Affect Pulse Qualities And Interpretation==

===Environment and etiology===

===Age at onset of ''qi'' deficiency===

===Gender===
A very ''thin'' pulse in a man and a very ''wide'' pulse in a woman are inappropriate signs.
Men tend toward ''heat'' from excess and women tend toward ''blood deficiency''.

===Body condition===

==== Vulnerability ====

Disharmony will first occur in the most deficient organ. For example, anger is commonly associated with the Liver, but if a person's Lungs are weaker than the Liver, the Lungs will be affected by anger first, and disharmony will then be found in the Lungs.

      <comment>/* Side Effects of LSD */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly known as LSD, has been known to cause psychedelic hallucinations and visions. It has not been known to be addictive or cause brain damage. LSD has been typically used for recreation in order to enhance creativity and out of body experiences. Albert Hoffman, in 1938, discovered LSD when making different derivatives of diethylamide. It's hallucinogenic properties were accidentally discovered in 1943. In the 1950's LSD was brought to the medical community has a tool to create a temporary psychotic state and be used along side psychotherapeutic treatments. It was in the 1960's that the general public began using LSD for recreational use, and remains a major drug to this day. &lt;ref name=&quot;LSD&quot;&gt;Annelie Hintzen, et al. &quot;The Pharmacology Of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: A Review.&quot; CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics 14.4 (2008): 295-314.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Overview ==

LSD blocks serotonin from the brain.  Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is in charge of regulating mood, muscle contraction, and other cognitive functions. The reason why LSD blocks serotonin is because of their structural similarity, LSD is mistake to be serotonin and is then sent to the synaptic cleft instead of serotonin. And like many other hallucinogenics, LSD has a substituted indole ring in its molecular structure, which contributes to its hallucinogenic effects. There are many perceptual changes altering the cognitive and visual sensory systems, as well as changed in the sense of time, body-image, and ego. Memory is also greatly effected. A typical &quot;trip&quot; can last anywhere between six and ten hours. The half-life in humans is approximately 175 minutes, though it is metabolized at different rates at different structures in the body. Not much clinical testing has been done since the 1970's, partly due to the fact that after the subjects have taken a dose of LSD they become &quot;too impaired to cooperate&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;LSD&quot; /&gt;

== Structure ==

The molecular configuration of crystal form LSD has been determined by using x-ray diffraction techniques. The configuration shows strain and steric hindrance. Serotonin and LSD are somewhat similar in structure as indicated by the indole ring present in both molecules. Therefore, the two molecules share similar chemical properties due to the similarity in structure. When comparing LSD and serotonin, the similarity between its electron densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital is observed.  The nitrogen atom possesses the electron density due to its free lone pair.
[[File:Serotonin-2D-skeletal.png|thumbnail]]serotonin 
[[File:LSD.png|thumbnail]] LSD
[[File:LSD isomers.png|thumbnail]]
LSD is prepared by reacting lysergic acid with diethylamide. LSD has the chemical composition C20H25N3O. It has four different isomers, however, only when it is R, and R, stereochemistry. Only one stereoisomer (the d-) is psychoactive. Therefore, a racemic mixture of LSD shows only  half the potency of the dextro form. 
The electron density is lowest in the areas around the indole ring in both molecules. The dipole moment of the two molecules are very close.  Serotonin is 2.98 D and LSD is 3.04 D; D is the SI unit measurement for electric dipole moment. The dipole moment is going towards the amine group in both molecules.  The virtually same dipole moments of both molecules is the key to the ability of LSD fitting into the same receptors as serotonin. 

== Storage ==
LSD is a somewhat stable organic molecule, like other  molecules with similar structures.The main factors to be concerned with are moisture due to chemical reactions in the presense of moisture, oxygen, light, and temperature.  Reaction rates typically depend  on temperature exponentially.  

== Synthesis ==

In its pure form, LSD is a white or clear, odorless, water-soluble crystal that can be crushed into a powder and dissolved. The most common form of LSD is known as blotter acid, sheets of paper that have are blotted with LSD.  Tablet known as microdot is also very common.  LSD is generally found as in its crystal form, dried on gelatin sheets or in capsule or liquid form.There a couple of different ways to make LSD. A common way is to start with lysergic acid. It will require morning glory seeds. Morning glory seeds and the seeds contain  lysergic acid amide. It is considered a precursor to LSD. The amount of LSA in different seeds varies . As a result, the quality of the drug made from it would also vary.
Another synthetic route is to use ergot. Once the ergot is obtained, one must extract the ergot alkaloids which contain basic nitrogen atoms. A darkroom working environment is necessary because the ergot will decompose under bright lights. LSD itself can break down quickly when exposed to light.The solvents and reagents used in the synthesis are also harmful. The solvent anhydrous hydrazine can explode when heated. It is a carcinogen. Another chemical often used in for the synthesis is chloroform. It can cause cancer as well while causing internal damages to organs. The ergot alkaloid is synthesized into a compound called iso-lysergic acid hydrazide through the addition of reagents and heating. The iso-lysergic acid hydrazide is isomerized in order to make it active. Once cooled, the isomer is mixed with an acid and a base, and evaporated. The product obatined is iso-lysergic diethylamide, which is isomerized again to produce active LSD. The LSD is then purified and crystallized in order to obtain a higher concentrated form.

==Side Effects of LSD==
There have been no documented human deaths from an LSD overdose. It is physiologically well tolerated and there is no evidence for long-lasting physiological effects on the brain or other parts of the human organism.
LSD may temporarily impair the ability to make sensible judgments and understand common dangers, thus making the user more susceptible to accidents and personal injury. It may cause temporary confusion, difficulty with abstract thinking, or signs of impaired memory and attention span

Granted, while describing a pickle before they eat it can aid in describing an object, describing their surroundings while, say, studying, might prove more useful. That is only my opinion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zur Klärung der Frage, was Dependency Injection (DI) soll zuerst beschrieben werden, welche Art von Abhängigkeit (Dependency) hiermit gemeint ist.

In DI steht das D für Abhängigkeiten zwischen Klassen bzw. genauer zwischen den korrespondierenden Objekten. 

Da in der Regel komplexere Objekte Funktionalitäten anderer Objekte benötigen, 
haben Sie diese Objekte in Membervariablen (Objektvariablen) gespeichert. 
z.B. (modifiziert aus M. Fowler: Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern, 2004 http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) :

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;..
public class MovieLister {
  ...
  private MovieFinder ;
  ....
  
  public Movie[] moviesDirectedBy(String directorName) {
        List&lt;Movie&gt; allMovies = finder.findAll();
        for (Movie movie : allMovies){
            if (!movie.getDirector().equals(directorName)) {
               it.remove();
            }
        }
        return allMovies.toArray();
    }
} 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Die Methode &lt;code&gt;moviesDirectedBy&lt;/code&gt; verwendet hier ein Objekt von Typ &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;. Man sagt &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; ist '''abhängig''' von &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt;.

Der &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; ist ein Interface, für die es eine Vielzahl von Implementierungen (&lt;code&gt;DBMovieFinder, ColonDelimiterMovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;) geben könnte. 
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public interface MovieFinder {
  List&lt;Movie&gt; findAll();
}

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Wenn nun aber direkt im Konstruktor des &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; eine konkrete &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;-Instanz erzeugt, ist diese Wiederverwertbarkeit nicht gegeben, z.B durch:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
class MovieLister
...
  private MovieFinder finder;
  public MovieLister() {
    finder = new ColonDelimitedMovieFinder(&quot;movies1.txt&quot;);
  }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Der &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; ist fest mit einer Implementierung des MovieFinder (&lt;code&gt;ColonDelimitedMovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;) verbunden. Dies führt zu einer starken Kopplung. Hierdurch ist aber die Methode &lt;code&gt;moviesDirectedBy&lt;/code&gt; bzw. der &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; nicht mehr für alle möglichen Ausprägungen (Implementierungen) des &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; nutzbar.
Außerdem lässt sich die Methode &lt;code&gt;moviesDirectedBy&lt;/code&gt; nicht mehr testen, ohne gleichzeitig den &lt;code&gt;ColonDelimitedMovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; mit zu testen. 
Ein weiterer Nachteil ist das die Abhängigkeit vom &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; zum &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; nicht in den Methoden-Signaturen (denke an Javadoc) erkennbar ist, sondern nur in der Implementierung.

Eine Lösung des Problems ist die Abhängigkeit z4 der 26n2reten 0*3e0ent5er4ng von außen hinein zugeben, z.B. über den Konstruktor (Constructor Injection). Nicht die die Klasse selbst kümmert sich um die Auflösung der konkret genutzten Implementierung des Interface. Sie wird von außen injiziert. Daher der Name &quot;Dependency (Abhängigkeit) Injection (Injizieren)&quot;.


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
  public MovieLister(MovieFinder finder) {
    this.finder = finder;
  }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Hier wird aus der Konstruktor-Signatur die Abhängigkeit ersichtlich. 


Dies ist die Grundlage von Dependency Injection (DI). Dabei ergeben sich folgende Vorteile:
* Bessere Wiederverwertbarkeit
* Schwächen der Kopplung zwischen den Komponenten
* Isoliertes Testen (injizieren von Mock-Objekten) wird möglich
* Erkennen der Abhängigkeit in der Methoden-, bzw. Konstruktor-Signatur.

Object oriented programming? 
What does this mean?

Let's split this term in to:
* object-oriented
* programming

=== Programming ===

Programming is like cooking

=== What is an object? ===

{{TextBox|'''Summary:''' 

:When programming, we'll deal with ''''objects''''. 
:Objects can be very concrete, such as a book or a car, or be very abstract such as a color or number}}

When we programm in an object-oriented way, we deal with objects. What are &quot;objects&quot; exactly?

The definition of &quot;objects&quot; in the context of programming is much broader than in the &quot;real world&quot;.

In the real world you would have no problem to identify these as objects:

* a computer
* a car
* a book
* a guitar
* a banana

It is very easy for us to think about them as objects. You can see them, they have a position in space, you can use them.

What about living things? Are they objects also? For example:

* an elephant
* bacteria
* your parents
* a movie star
* yourself (?!)

Are these also objects? Yes, they are. Don't be confused and think that we are treating persons with disrespect by calling them &quot;objects&quot;. As you will see soon, it's pretty much the other way around: we will be treating objects like persons!

To this point you probably had little to no difficulty for recognizing these as ''real'' objects. However, in the object-oriented world there are many less-obvious cases. Things that you would conceptually recognize, but hardly smell, feel, touch or even see.

Pieces of information are also objects:

* today's temperature
* the current year
* the name of your first teacher
* the price of a cinema ticket
* your age

You might think it is strange to talk about these as &quot;objects&quot;. Well, it get's better than that.

In the object-oriented world we can deal with very abstract concepts and still call them &quot;objects&quot;.

Here are some examples to broaden your mind:

* the Internet
* a music concert
* the night
* the color red
* the number 3
* thruthness

At this point you might be confused. Don't worry, there is only one thing to remember. In the object-oriented world: '''everything is an object'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In rhetoric, ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (pistis (πίστις)) or modes of persuasion (other principles being logos and pathos ) discussed by Aristotle in 'Rhetoric' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start. This can involve &quot;moral competence&quot; only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include expertise and knowledge. Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech is even begun (cf Isocrates).

According to Nedra Reynolds, Professor of Writing &amp; Rhetoric, &quot;ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces&quot;(Reynolds, 336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim &quot;that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'&quot; because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (Reynolds, 336). While its meaning and application within literature might differ over time, this classical interpretation persists.

There are three categories of ethos.
    
* phronesis - practical skills &amp; wisdom
    
* arete - virtue, goodness
    
* eunoia - goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:
    
* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
    
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
    
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is a formal fallacy, rendering the dismissal of the argument invalid.

The term &quot;source credibility&quot; has been used as the construct examined in the social sciences. Though recent work has found support for the existence of the three dimensions identified above, work from the 1950s through the 1980s consistently revealed two dimensions (competence and character) with other dimensions such as dynamism found only when broad approaches equating credibility with &quot;person perception&quot; were taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since economic reforms that created a mostly free economy in 1991, India has grown rapidly. Over the last 10 years, real GDP growth has averaged 7.44% per year, compared to 2.56% per year in the United States &lt;ref&gt; Index Mundi [http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=66&amp;c=us&amp;l=en]&lt;/ref&gt; This growth has been concentrated in urban centers, often completely passing over the rural poor. [[w:Ratan Tata|Ratan Tata]], former head of the [[w:Tata Group|Tata Group]], one of India's largest companies, had an idea that, if properly implemented, would help spread wealth to the rural poor: a cheap car that could be marketed to the lower class. Many poor Indian families use two-wheel motorbikes to travel, an unsafe practice which also limits the distance that can be traveled.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I saw families riding around on scooters with kids standing up and the mother carrying a baby and decided to do something about it. It started as a quest: affordable transportation solution.&quot; -Ratan Tata &lt;ref&gt; Tata Motors Presentation [http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/aSGuest37030-314986-tata-nano-future-2020-education-ppt-powerpoint/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Mr. Tata's solution to this problem was the 1 lakh ($2250)  [[w:Tata Nano|Tata Nano]]. The Tata Nano has received high praise for it's implementation of frugal engineering and product innovation. It was predicted to expand India's car market by 65% and cause an overall dip in prices; however, after four years, it has failed to live up to its high expectations, in many cases because of Tata Motor's errors. &lt;ref&gt; The Indian Express [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/two-years-on-tata-nano-sales-yet-to-hit-top-gear/941736/2]&lt;/ref&gt; Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India, says &quot;the Nano is a brilliant concept... but it is a monumental marketing blunder.&quot; Many rural Indians never heard about the car that was supposed to help transform their lives &lt;ref&gt;Stuck in low gear; Tata's Nano [http://www.economist.com/node/21526374]&lt;/ref&gt;, and it has not been as successful as anticipated. 

==Tata Nano Marketing Strategy==
The target population of the Tata Nano was low income rural families who relied heavily on motorcycles. However, the weak sales of the car show that Tata Motors' marketing campaign was mistargeted. In 2010, the then CEO of Tata Motors Carl-Peter Forster admitted that the company had to &quot;reinvent the Nano business model.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The Little Car That Couldn't [http://www.economist.com/node/18285497]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010 &lt;ref&gt;The Little Car That Couldn't [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2096849-3,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;,  cities with a population greater than 500,000 had 619 showrooms whereas towns with a population less than 500,000 had only six showrooms, which is why the rural population whose lives the Nano was intended to transform never even heard of the car. Tata Motors recognized this discrepancy and has made plans for 300 more distribution centers in rural areas. Furthermore, no financing scheme was provided at launch which deterred low income households from purchasing the car.

The sales of the Nano also suffered from negative publicity received due to reports of fires under the hood. When the car was first launched, the marketing campaign was subdued and media reports of the fires were more prominent. Monthly sales fell to 509 units during this period, far less than the target sales of 20,000 units per month &lt;ref&gt;The Little Car That Couldn't [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2096849-3,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:altis_envy.gif|right|thumb|The average Indian household wants a car that's a status symbol, not a cheap car. ]]
[[File:Indian_middle_class.JPG|left|thumb|India's aspiring middle class is rising rapidly ]]


===Aspirations of the Indian middle class===
The Nano was marketed as a cheap car at launch. However, the average aspiring Indian middle class household considers a car as a status symbol. The Corolla advertisement on the right shows what a customer is looking for in a car. The Nano provides far better fuel economy than the next cheapest car, but consumerism trumps economic sense. After tax and basic add-ons, the Nano costs $3500, but many families chose to save a bit more and buy the next best car for $4500. Moreover, the middle class is rising rapidly in India. McKinsey's report on India's consumer goods market shows that 77% of Indian households are expected to have annual income ranging from 90,000-1,000,000 Indian rupees ($1650-$18,350) by 2025, up from 45% in 2005 &lt;ref&gt; The 'Bird of Gold': The Rise of India's Cosumer Market [http://www.mckinsey.com/locations/india/mckinseyonindia/pdf/India_Consumer_Market.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Focus on urban youth===

While the Nano was not popular with rural low income households, the few cars that did sell were popular among the urban youth. Tata Motors has responded to this unintended use of the Nano by targeting this demographic. The television and youtube commercials of the Nano show the changing focus of the customer base. During launch in 2009, the Nano was marketed as a family car ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WB87eo_obU video advertisement in 2009]), whereas the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmSy69sUoQ 2012 video advertisement] appeals to the youth. Tata Motors has also started an aggressive marketing campaign to brand the car as a trendy, fun car through social networking and artistic collaborations. The Nano facebook page has two million fans and a merchandise store is available on eBay. Through the Nano Art in Motion campaign, artists paint the car in creative colorful themes.

==Tata Nano and the Lower Class==

The Tata Nano was designed to target those in India's lower class because many people in the lower class of India do not have transportation either due to a lack of supply or a high cost of access.  Lack of transportation inhibits the lower class from looking for work, transporting goods, and obtaining health care. &lt;ref&gt;The Next 4 Billion [http://pdf.wri.org/n4b_full_text_lowrez.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the lower class is left to walking, bicycling, or driving animal-drawn carts.  Low class families also ride on motorcycles, as this is a cheap form of faster mobility.



The design of the Nano and its low cost was an effort to provide cheap alternative transportation for families unsafely crowded on two-wheel transportation. A portion of consumers saw the Tata Nano as a viable option.  For example, an Indian blogger claims that that Nano &quot;is good for people who ride bike.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Tata Nano User Review [www.gaadi.com/review-Tata-Nano+-123]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintended Use of the Tata Nano===
The Tata Nano was ultimately purchased by the middle class and aspiring urban youth due to unforeseen economic pressures. Vishnu Mathur, the Director-General of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturing, claims that the &quot;[automobile] market continues to be tough due to...high interest rates and fuel prices.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; The Hindu [http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/car-sales-dip-825-in-november/article4185400.ece] &lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the characteristics of the Indian economy not only deterred many intended lower class consumers, but also attracted unintended users with more disposable income.  Low class consumers are still purchasing motorcycles because of their low cost and low gasoline consumption.

India is going through a period of rapid inflation implemented by the central bank.  A high borrowing rate has impacted the finances of the lower class, and they are resorting to motorbikes because &quot;especially for short distances, bikes make more sense.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Topix.com [http://www.topix.com/forum/autos/tata-nano/T20J6IA6T816H44DE] &lt;/ref&gt;  The chief financial officer of the Indian-run Hero MotoCorp. Ltd. claims that &quot;the worst affected [by India's inflation] is the passenger-car market, where the dependence on loans...is high.&quot; While 30 percent of motorcycles are bought with a loan, approximately 80 percent of cars are bought with loans. &lt;ref&gt; Bloomberg News [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  Bloomberg data shows that India has the third highest borrowing costs in Asia, with an increase in the repurchase rate by almost 4 percent since March of 2010. &lt;ref&gt;India Chooses Motorbikes Over Tata Nanos [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  When loans have such a high interest rate, the demand of the Tata Nano went down with an associated increase in demand for cheaper alternatives, like motorcycles and other less-expensive transportation.  

Petrol prices are also rising, benefiting motorcycle manufacturers because people of India are traveling less and are thus using motorcycles which work well with short distances and require less gasoline per mile.  Gasoline costs in India are Rs. 68.64 per liter and prices are now 26 percent higher than a year ago. &lt;ref&gt;India Chooses Motorbikes Over Tata Nanos [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  Passenger vehicle sales are lower than they have been for the last ten years, and &quot;two-wheeler deliveries rose 2 percent in October, extending consecutive monthly gains since January 2009.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The increase in interest rates and gas prices has not only decreased Tata Nano consumption, but those who are purchasing the Tata Nano are those in the middle class and aspiring youth.  Lower class Indian citizens continue to purchase cheaper but unsafe motorcycles and bikes, leaving the purchasing of the Tata Nano to unintended consumers.

==Tata Nano and Conflict with the Government==
Tata misjudged the public perception of rural farmers whose land they were using for the Tata Nano factory.  In May 2006, Tata announced plans to build a factory in the town of [[w:Singur|Singur]], [[w:West Bengal|West Bengal]], approximately one hour outside of [[w:Kolkata|Kolkata]].&lt;ref&gt; Hindustan Times [http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Kolkata/Court-verdict-on-Singur-mars-Didi-s-home-run/Article1-876893.aspx] &lt;/ref&gt; When economic regulations were relaxed in 1991, much of West Bengal was rapidly converted back to farmland by the Marxist government, with thousands of farmers receiving small parcels of land. By 2006, Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Industry Minister Nirupam Sen (of the same Marxist Party) were intent on bringing India's rapid growth to West Bengal, and saw the Nano factory as an opportunity to do so. It was estimated that the Nano factory would bring thousands of jobs to the region, and the politicians felt pressured to make concessions to the Tatas in order to ensure economic growth.&lt;ref&gt; Telegraph India [http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061014/asp/bengal/story_6870254.asp] &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Tata factory will certainly come up in Singur. We are trying our
best to provide land to those who want to set up factories.&quot;
-- Chief Minister Bhattarcharjee&lt;/blockquote&gt;



To provide land for the factory, Bhattarcharjee and Sen employed the arcane 1894 Land Acquisition Act, a version of eminent domain passed by the British during their rule to build public works, and bought 997 acres of farmland using state funds. The law's use of the phrase &quot;public purpose&quot; has been interpreted by the Kolkata High Court as a socio-economic decision best left to individual governments, meaning that Bhattacharjee and Sen were probably within their legal rights. However, roughly 2,250 of the over 13,000 farmers refused to sell their land. They felt their cropland was fertile enough to make a living, and that being bought out by the government was a violation of their rights. &lt;ref&gt; Telegraph India&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the urban poor from Kolkata and other larger cities joined the farmers in the fight, arguing that the peasants have emotional bond with the land, and money cannot compensate for this loss. &lt;ref&gt; Majumdar Dissertation [http://udini.proquest.com/view/peasants-against-the-nano-pqid:1936625261/] &lt;/ref&gt;

Their champion in this case became [[w:Mamata Banerjee|Mamata Banerjee]], the leader of the [[w:Trinamool Congress|Trinamool Congress]] opposition party. She rallied the coalition of farmers and urban poor to her cause, energizing them through a 25-day hunger strike in December 2006. Over the next year and a half, she stood behind rallies, human blockades, and massive strikes that eventually caused Tata to abandon the Singur site in October 2008, despite investing over Rs. 15 billion ($275M) in the project. Banerjee and her party received strong public support for their efforts, and won a large victory during May 2011 elections, unseating the Marxist party for the first time in 30 years.&lt;ref&gt; Telegraph India &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Economist [http://www.economist.com/node/12010079] &lt;/ref&gt; Tata instead built the factory in [[w:Gujarat|Gujarat]], India, sparking counter-protests in Singur from those who supported the factory because of its economic benefits, but the decision had been made. &lt;ref&gt; Majumdar Dissertation &lt;/ref&gt;

This debate over the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act and the power of the government to exercise eminent domain is still being fought in the courts. Mamata Banerjee continues to promise that all farmers will get their land back&lt;ref&gt;Hindustan Times 2[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/WestBengal/Mamata-promises-Singur-land-back-to--unwilling-landlosers/Article1-966691.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;, but the matter will be heard by the Indian Supreme Court during the next session. The Kolkata High Court declared the 1894 Act unconstitutional. If this decision is upheld, all land would immediately be returned to the farmers. If the decision is overturned, however, this will have far-reaching implications for how businesses approach capital investments in India.

==Tata Nano in the Future==
At the moment, the future of the Nano is very uncertain. It could still catch with the original intended market in India, and Tata Motors wants to sell it internationally as well. Within three years, US customers might be able to buy a slightly reconfigured Nano for under $10,000, although there are significant distribution obstacles to overcome. &lt;ref&gt; Autoblog.com [http://www.autoblog.com/2012/10/15/redesigned-tata-nano-to-arrive-in-u-s-wearing-price-tag-under/]&lt;/ref&gt; There are few predictions of what the future might hold for the Nano, but the fact remains that it is a brilliant engineering solution that, so far, has failed to appropriately manage the social interface of technology.

      <comment>Answer to the question</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, the text after the first piece of code says: &quot;A check for self assignment is not strictly necessary but can give some performance improvements in (rarely occurring) self-assignment cases.&quot;

I don't understand why a check for self assignment is not necessary.
If we have a String s1, whose str pointer is pointing somewhere, and we write then:
s1 = s1;
This will:
1) create a temporary object, initialised with s1:
String temp (s1);

2) swap str pointers with the current object (s1):
temp.swap (s1); // so here, both temp and s1 point to the same char *.

3) return (*this)= s1:

4) delete temp, thus deleting s1.str.

So why's this acceptable?

I would have thought that one would need to write:
String &amp; operator = (String const &amp;s) {
      if (this != &amp;s) {
        String temp (s); // Copy-constructor -- RAII
        temp.swap (*this); // Non-throwing swap
      }
      return *this;
    }

Can someone please explain why this is not the case?

My answer (isn't there an answer function here?): 
s and temp are not the same pointer (if the Copy contstructor is using deep copy).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structural Biochemistry/ Secondary Bonds ==
Many of the properties of protein indicate that a variety of bonds other than the peptide exist in them. These secondary bonds hold the chain in its natural configuration.
Some of secondary bonds commonly found in proteins:
     '''1.Covalent Bond- Disulfide Bond (-S-S-)'''
Covalent bonds are strongest chemical bonds contributing to protein structure. Covalent bonds arise when two atoms share electrons. Covalent bond found between [[amino acid]] residues in protein and polypeptide in the disulfide bond of two [[cysteine]] residues to yield a mole of [[cystine]].
In general, reaction may be written as:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Disulfide-bond.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The disulfide bond is with typical bond strength of 50kcal/mole, about 2A&lt;sup&gt;o

*Oxytocin : a hormone stimulating the contraction of smooth muscles expecially during childbirth. Oxytoxin is a peptide of nine amino acid that contains a disulfide bond between two cysteine.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Oxytocin with labels.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;
 
Structure of Oxytocin 1

*Insulin: two peptide chains are linked together by 2 disulfide bonds, connecting the amino acid cysteine to cysteine.
     '''2.Hydrogen Bond:'''
In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared by two other atoms.When two atoms bearing partial negative charges share partially positively charged hydrogen, the atoms are engaged in a hydrogen bond.
Hydrogen bond is about 2.8A&lt;sup&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt; in length with typical length strong of 5-8 kcal/ mole and maxima when the bond is linear. Hydrogen bonds are stronger than van der Waals bonds but weaker than covalent bond.
     '''3. Nonpolar or Hydrophobic Bond'''
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Water drop on a leaf.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hydrophobic bonds are a major force driving proper protein folding. Many amino acids ( [[Alanine]],[[Valine]], [[Leucine]], [[Isoleucine]], [[Methionine]], [[Trytophan]], [[Phenylalanine]] and [[Tyrosine]]) have the side chains  are essentially hydrophobic. It means they have little attraction for water molecules in comparison to the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
The hydrophobic also play important role in the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes and antibody-antigen interactions.
 
      '''4.Ionic ( Electrostatic Bond)'''
Ionic binds are formed as amino acids bearing opposite electrical charged in the hydrophobic core of proteins. These amino acid contribute negatively charged and positively changed side chains to the polypeptide backbone. In a long polypeptide chain containing a large number of charged side chains, there are many electrostatic interactions. Ionic bond, although weaker than the hydrogen bonds, but they can be important to protein structure because they are potent electrostatic attractions that can approach the strength of covalent bonds.
The force of such an electrostatic attraction is given by Coulomb's law:
                     F=q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;D
which is q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the charged of the two groups, r is the distance between them, and D is the dielectric constant of the medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Branding?==
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand Brand] is some type of visual representation, whether through words, images, colors, or shapes, that is used to uniquely identify a company, product, or good.  Branding of products is not only a method by which to distinguish one product from another, but is a way to increase public awareness of that product.  Branding is especially important when discussing issues at the socio-technical interface; a brand is a powerful tool that can sway public perception of a technology.

==Hydraulic Fracturing vs. Fracking==
One of the biggest issues facing our society today is the development of alternative energy sources to decrease carbon emissions and potential climate change.  As oil and gas sources dwindle, people hope to find more &quot;unconventional&quot; sources to produce these fossil fuels&lt;ref name=&quot;Linley&quot;&gt;Linley, D. (2011, August). Fracking under pressure: The environmental and social impacts and risks of shale gas development. Sustainalytics.&lt;/ref&gt;.  One such unconventional source is shale gas, extracted via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing hydraulic fracturing].  There are many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_United_States environmental] and social impacts that incite debate over the technology.  Supporters of [http://i.imgur.com/NAF7B.jpg hydraulic fracturing] explain the process as one in which safe and controlled additives or fluids are sent into the shale layer of the earth's crust, pushing the natural gas up through the well, and into a facility or storage vessel above ground.  Opponents of [http://i.imgur.com/4iv1s.jpg fracking], on the other hand, focus on the use of potential hazardous chemicals leaking into ground water, as well as excessive water consumption leading to shortages.

==Social Perspectives==
Social groups and organizations participating in the debate of this technology draw on many of the same environmental impacts; however each spins them in a way to brand the technology as either a positive or negative process.  

===Support===
By far the largest and most vocal proponents of this technology are major American oil companies.  More modest proponents are environmental departments of states in which hydraulic fracturing is practiced.

=====Chevron's Approach=====
Chevron’s website currently runs an [http://www.chevron.com/next/producingnaturalgasprotectingwater/ article accompanied by a video] explaining the process of hydraulic fracturing.  At a glance, the video's first image appears to depict trees or other foliage.  The viewer later learns that the image is actually a hydraulic fracturing well.  This subtle imagery could indicate Chevron's attempt at branding hydraulic fracturing as a nature-friendly, well-controlled process.

The video features still shots of scientists discussing complex diagrams of natural gas reservoirs. These images of scientists are presented in such a way as to brand hydraulic fracturing as a technology that has been carefully researched by experts in the field.

Throughout the video there are panoramic scenes of pristine American landscapes, mountains and vast forests dotted with comparatively small natural gas production sites.  This imagery helps to emphasize that hydraulic fracturing is well-established and that Chevron is invested in ensuring environmental and water quality.  The imagery aids in Chevron's branding of the technology as natural and green.

=====The Language of Oil Companies=====
Like Chevron, many other oil companies participating in hydraulic fracturing publish articles or webpages to explain the technology.  A survey of these articles published by nine of the top U.S. oil producers found the following word usage &lt;ref&gt;Hess Corporation 2010 corporate sustainability report. (2011, June). Retrieved December 9, 2012, from http://www.hess.com/reports/sustainability/US/2010/default.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natural gas. (2012).

&lt;/center&gt;

The word ''fracking'' is used infrequently due to the anti-fracking movement's success in branding the word as synonymous with evil corporate profiteering at the expense of the environment.  While ''natural gas'' and ''methane'' are both names for the product, the former sounds more environmentally friendly.  The word ''chemicals'' follows the same pattern, as it evokes negative feelings.  These word choices show how companies are attempting to assign a friendlier brand to the technology.

=====Ohio Department of Natural Resources=====
Another clear proponent of hydraulic fracturing is the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR).  The agency's webpage uses tactics similar to those of oil companies in its presentation of the technology.

ODNR's page on hydraulic fracturing is titled &quot;Shale Development&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Natural Resources, Shale development. (Ohio). Retrieved December 9, 2012, from https://ohiodnr.com/tabid/23415/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similar to several oil companies' pages, the ODNR never refers to the technology as ''fracking'', opting instead for a more positive-sounding brand name.  Beyond explicit re-branding of the technology, the ODNR assures readers that environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing are minimal.  For instance, the ODNR states that while water is a &quot;key ingredient&quot; in hydraulic fracturing, the technology poses no risk of drinking water shortages.  ODNR informs readers that water usage in a hydraulic fracturing well is comparable to that in more familiar water intensive practices, e.g. golf course maintenance&lt;ref&gt;Dept. of Natural Resources, Water (Flowback) From Hydraulic Fracturing. (Ohio ). Retrieved December 9, 2012, from https://ohiodnr.com/Portals/11/pdf/wastewater-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

Unlike the oil companies, the ODNR does not stand to profit directly from hydraulic fracturing development.  The department's support of the technology is the result of its mission statement: &quot;To ensure a balance between wise use and protection of our natural resources for the benefit of all&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dept. of Natural Resrouces, History and Purpose of the Department Of Natural Resources. (Ohio).  Retrieved December 9, 2012, from http://ohiodnr.com/tabid/10748/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  The ODNR's subtle re-branding efforts represent its attempts to ease public concerns over a technology it has deemed to be safe, and therefore beneficial to the state of Ohio.

===Opposition===
====Social Organizations====
[[File:Stop Frack Attack.JPG|thumbprint|right|x200px]]
In 2011, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), released its recommendations on fracking, &quot;allowing the practice in most areas of the state outside of the New York City and Syracuse watersheds&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Food&quot;&gt;Food &amp; Water Watch. (2011, July 7). 49 groups call on Cuomo for statewide fracking ban [Press release].&lt;/ref&gt;.  This exclusion of the New York City watershed potentially communicates remaining uncertainty as to the safety of the technology.  A coalition of 49 national and state level social interest groups rose up and called for a state-wide ban on the process.  Of these groups included [http://democracyforamerica.com/ Democracy for America], [http://www.frackaction.com/ Frack Action], [http://www.foe.org/ Friends of the Earth], and the [http://chej.org/ Center for Health, Environment &amp; Justice].  The coalition also sent a petition to Governor Cuomo, signed by &quot;'nearly 20,000 New Yorkers...in the first 24 hours,'&quot; according to the Campaign Manager of [http://www.credoaction.com/ CREDO Action], another participating organization &lt;ref name=&quot;Food&quot;&gt;Food &amp; Water Watch. (2011, July 7). 49 groups call on Cuomo for statewide fracking ban [Press release].&lt;/ref&gt;.   

These organizations rely heavily on language, similar to the oil companies, but to promote fracking as a harmful and hazardous technology.  They each publish articles, press releases, and letters to politicians, emphasizing the dangerous impacts of fracking.  A survey of these publications by 6 social organizations found the following word usage&lt;ref&gt;Frack Action. (n.d.). What is fracking? Retrieved from http://www.frackaction.com/what-is-fracking/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth. (2011, August 8). [Letter to Barack Obama]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CREDO Action. (n.d.).

&lt;/center&gt;

While their motive for choosing the words ''frack'' and ''chemicals'' is obvious, the higher frequency of describing the produced fuel as ''natural gas'' instead of ''methane'' is also deliberate.  Many of the organizations described the fuel as ''&quot;natural&quot; gas'', where the use of quotes directly implies their skepticism of how natural this fuel really is.

====Individuals====    
Aside from large organizations, individual citizens have also begun raising their voices in concern.  Maxime Daigle of New Brunswick, spent his career as an oil worker in Alberta, British Columbia and across the U.S.  In January 2012, he expressed his major concerns with the industry, having seen it from the inside: &quot;Some rig managers...make you contain contamination...But I've seen many times where you're told just to cover it with dirt, fresh dirt so nobody sees it&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (2012, January 26). Blow the whistle: ex-oil worker exposes the dangers of Hydro-Fracking. Westside Gazette.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Daigle effectively draws on his own first-hand experience to further perpetuate the negative branding of fracking.

In 2011, Frederick Mayer, a self described disabled veteran and resident of Candor, NY, made a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEtgvwllNpg video] of himself lighting his kitchen sink water on fire.  He sent the video to [http://www.toxicstargeting.com/ Toxics Targeting], an environmental database service.  Mayer lived near the Marcellus Shale Formation, a large natural gas deposit, and claimed the drilling is what led to a natural gas leak in his drinking water.  He shared how he reported the problem to the DEC, yet no one came to inspect his water or fix the gas leak&lt;ref&gt;Toxics Targeting. (n.d.). Ignitable drinking water in Candor, NY, above Marcellus Shale [Video file]. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEtgvwllNpg&lt;/ref&gt;.  Frederick Mayer not only added to the negative branding of fracking and its potential environmental impacts, but also highlighted the fact that even environmental groups are not doing as much as they should to help.  Describing himself as a disabled veteran, while having nothing to do with the issue, Mayer also associates fracking with harming vulnerable groups.

==A Political Case Study==
For decades, many federal policy breaks have been granted to oil and gas companies in response to “industrial, legislative and lobbying pressures&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoggan, J., DeMelle, B., Gelbspan, R., &amp; Littlemore, R. (n.d.). Gas politics are polluted [Blog post]. Retrieved from DeSmogBlog website: http://www.desmogblog.com/fracking-the-future/politics.html#footnote-22309-22 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colborn, T., Kwiatkowski, C., Schultz, K., &amp; Bachran, M. (2011). Natural gas operations from a public health perspective. International Journal of Human and Ecological Risk Assessment.  &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005 Energy Policy Act of 2005] included a controversial amendment that exempted hydraulic fracturing from part of the [http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/index.cfm Safe Drinking Water Act] (SDWA). The 2005 Act “inserted new language to exempt ‘the underground injection of fluids or propping agents (other than diesel fuels) pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities'”&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. (n.d.) Regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act. Retrieved from http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/wells_hydroreg.cfm &lt;/ref&gt;.  This amendment became known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton Halliburton] Loophole, named after one of the largest oil producers in the world.

While the Halliburton Loophole relieves the Federal Government of regulating hydraulic fracturing, states are still free to impose regulations as they see fit.  In June, 2011 the Ohio State Senate passed Senate Bill 315 granting the ODNR authority to regulate state-wide hydraulic fracturing&lt;ref&gt;Department of Natural Resources, Senate Bill 315 - Improving regulatory framework, S. 2012 (Ohio 2012). Retrieved from https://www.dnr.state.oh.us/tabid/23947/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  ODNR Director James Zehringer championed the Bill saying, “If Ohioans lose confidence in our ability to protect public health and safety, this potential boom will fizzle”&lt;ref&gt;Hearings on 315 before the House Public Utilities Commitee, 2012 Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2012) (testimony of James Zehringer).&lt;/ref&gt;.  While both ODNR and large oil companies are strong supporters of hydraulic fracturing, Zehringer recognizes that without social support, the technology cannot be successful.  He skillfully brands the ODNR as an organization that is concerned with citizen well-being in an attempt to increase acceptance of the technology, particularly by the opposition.

== Conclusions ==
One of the most important factors in determining public acceptance of a technology is the way in which relevant social groups develop a brand through use of language and imagery.  Participants in debates will try to brand the technology in a way that suits their opinions and needs.  Opponents have branded the word ''fracking'' and played off of its negative sound to brand the technology as a whole.  Supporters have tried to invoke the use of other words and imagery to brand the technology in a more positive light.  Supporters are not trying to rebrand the term ''fracking'', but instead to associate it with different language.  Once a brand has been established, rebranding societal perception of a technology is very difficult.

==Opportunities for Further Study==
Future teams may be interested in augmenting this chapter by further investigating political outcomes of this technology.  Court cases and legislation, such as the 1997 case of LEAF vs. EPA or the defeat of the 2009 NAT GAS Senate bill, may prove to be areas of great interest within the socio-technical interface of hydraulic fracturing.  It may also be of interest to research the effect of language on the success of legislation.  Additionally, future teams may look into other terms used to describe this technology.

*As of 2006, one third of all nations suffered from clean water scarcity,
&lt;ref name=&quot;uneca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Options to Enhance Survival and Growth|url=http://www.uneca.org/awich/Water%20in%20Africa.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Water scarcity''' or [[Physical water scarcity|lack of safe drinking water]] is one of the world's leading problems affecting more than 1.1 billion people globally, meaning that one in every six people lacks access to safe [[drinking water]].
&lt;ref name=&quot;bpn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts About The Global Drinking Water Crisis|url=http://blueplanetnetwork.org/water/facts|year=2010|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] set up by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[UNICEF|United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF) defines safe drinking water as &quot;water with microbial, chemical and physical characteristics that meets WHO guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality.&quot;

* With a complete lack of water, humans can on average only live up to 3 to 5 days.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Water Page|url=http://www.thewaterpage.com/live-without-water.htm|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This often forces those living in water deprived regions to turn to unsafe water resources, which then contributes to the spread of [[waterborne diseases]] including [[malaria]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], [[dysentery]] and [[diarrhea]], and can lead to diseases such as [[trachoma]], plague, and [[typhus]].
&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Facts About Water Scarcity|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/water/en/|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, water scarcity causes many people to store water in their households, which increases the risk of household water contamination and incidents of malaria and dengue fever spread by mosquitos.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;
These waterborne diseases are not usually found in developed countries because of sophisticated [[water treatment]] systems that filter and chlorinate water, but natural, untreated water sources often contain tiny disease-carrying worms and bacteria.
&lt;ref name=WS&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Scarcity: The Importance of Water &amp; Access|url=http://thewaterproject.org/water_scarcity.asp|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these waterborne sicknesses are treatable and preventable, they are nonetheless one of the leading causes of disease and death in the world. Globally, 2.2 million people die each year from diarrhea-related disease, and at any given time fifty percent of all hospital beds in the world are occupied by patients suffering from water-related diseases.&lt;ref name=bpn /&gt; 

* Efforts made by the United Nations with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] have targeted water scarcity globally. The compiled list includes eight international development goals, seven of which are directly impacted by water scarcity. Access to water affects poverty, food scarcity, educational attainment, social and economic capital of women, livelihood security, disease, and human and environmental health.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action Water for Life 2005-2015: Water Scarcity|url=http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because addressing the issue of water is so integral to reaching the MDGs, one of the sub-goals includes halving the proportion of the globe’s population without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. In March 2012, the UN announced that this goal has been met almost four years in advance, suggesting that global efforts to reduce water scarcity are on a successful trend.
&lt;ref name=remarks&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks in Honor of World Water Day|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/03/186640.htm|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* As one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], the United States plays an integral role in promoting solutions to aid with clean water scarcity. One of many efforts include [[w:USAID|USAID’s]] [[WASH]]- the WASH for Life partnership with the Gates Foundation- that works to promote water, sanitation, and hygiene. With this, the U.S. &quot;will identify, test, and scale up evidence-based approaches for delivering these services to people in some of the poorest regions&quot;. &lt;ref name=remarks/&gt;
Additionally, in March 2012, Hillary Clinton announced the U.S. Water Partnership, which will bring together people from the private sector, the philanthropic community, non-governmental organizations, academics, experts, and the government in an attempt to look for system-wide solutions. &lt;ref name=remarks/&gt;
The technologies and ability to tackle the issue of water scarcity and cleanliness are present, but it is highly a matter of accessibility. Thus, the partnership will aim at making these solutions available and obtainable at a local level.

===Can be useful for '''Drinking water/''' new page===

* Moving beyond sanitary waste disposal and pumps, clean water technology can now be found in the form of drinking straw filtration. Used as solution by Water Is Life, the straw is small, portable, and each $10. &lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;
The filtration device is designed to eliminate waterborne diseases, and as a result provide safe drinking water for one person for one year. &lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

* Other solutions to clean water scarcity issues have focused on innovative pump systems, including hand-pumps, Water for People’s “[[w:Roundabout PlayPump|Play Pumps]]”,&lt;ref name=WFP/&gt; and Pump Aid’s “Elephant Pumps”. &lt;ref name=PA/&gt;
All three designs are built to aid communities in drawing clean water from wells. The hand pump is the most basic and simple to repair, with replacement parts easily found. &lt;ref name=LWI/&gt;
Using a more creative approach, Play Pumps combine child’s play with clean water extraction through the use of playground equipment, called a roundabout. The idea behind this is as children play on the roundabout, water will simultaneously be pumped from a reservoir tank to either toilets, hand-washing stations, or for drinking water. &lt;ref name=PA/&gt;
Alternatively, Elephant Pumps are just extremely simple hand water pumps. After a well is prepared, a rope-pump mechanism is installed that is easy to maintain, uses locally sourced parts, and can be up and running in the time span of about a week. &lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Web authoring software ==

Website creation has changed from simply writing some Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code and loading to the World Wide Web. HTML is what the first website developers had to use and, while it worked, by itself it is cumbersome and tedious. It still serves a major role in web site design and is the main markup language for displaying web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. However, the growing demand for complicated and complex websites has grown to help foster the creation of Web Authoring Software.  Website creation now encompasses a range of skills including graphic design, web design, programming, system integration, audio editing and video editing.
Larger commercial web sites use Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Drupal&lt;ref&gt;
Drupal http://drupal.org/home
&lt;/ref&gt;
and Joomla&lt;ref&gt;
Joomla http://joomla.co.uk/
&lt;/ref&gt;
(open source), Adobes’ Dreamweaver (commercial software) and WordPress&lt;ref&gt;
WordPress http://wordpress.org/
&lt;/ref&gt;
(also open source).
These Web authoring software programs encompass a variety of programming tools and languages including PHP, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, and WYSIWYG HTML editors to provide custom features quickly to a website under construction.
Web authoring software is software used by web designers and developers to create applications and websites across multiple platforms including tablets and browsers. A primary purpose of using Web authoring software is to utilize web standards based framework for websites that flow easily across multiple screens. Web authoring software automates and organizes many of the tasks and steps needed to put together a well thought out website. Web site prototypes are created using artwork, video, audio, and text, using accepted standards for web page creation.

A key feature of Web authoring software is the ability to layout semantic web design using CSS inspectors and tools.
A CSS page layout uses the Cascading Style Sheets format, rather than traditional HTML tables or frames, to organize the content on a web page. The basic building block of the CSS layout is the &quot;div tag&quot;—an HTML tag that in most cases acts as a container for text, images, and other page elements. When you create a CSS layout, you place div tags on the page, add content to them, and position them in various places. Unlike table cells, which are restricted to existing somewhere within the rows and columns of a table, div tags can appear anywhere on a web page. Website developers position div tags by specifying floats, paddings, and margins, the preferred methods by today’s web standards. 

Commercial Web authoring software (for instance Dreamweaver CS6)&lt;ref&gt;
Dreamweaver http://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
eliminates having to make CSS layouts from scratch.
This may be very desirable because unaided CSS layout can be very time-consuming and be difficult because there are so many ways to do it.
Simple two-column CSS layout may be accomplished by setting floats, margins, paddings, and other CSS properties in a nearly infinite number of combinations.
CSS layouts made from scratch will not display properly in some browsers{{fact}}. Dreamweaver allows the building of pages with CSS layouts by providing 16 pre-designed layouts that work across different browsers.

* In [[Australia]] there is competition for the resources of the Darling River system between [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. In the [[Macquarie Marshes]] of NSW [[grazing]] and [[irrigation]] interests compete for water flowing to the marshes. The [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] diverted water from the [[Snowy River]] to the [[Murray River]] and the [[Murrumbidgee River]] for the benefit of irrigators and [[electricity]] generation through [[hydro-electric power]]. During recent years government has taken action to increase [[environmental flows]] to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the [[Murray Darling Basin]]. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows.

* In [[Victoria, Australia]] a proposed pipeline from the [[Goulburn Valley]] to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] has led to protests by farmers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23069045-5010020,00.html Retrieved 2009-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

* By far the largest part of [[Australia]] is [[Deserts of Australia|desert]] or semi-arid lands commonly known as the [[outback]]. In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, possibly irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole [[Murray-Darling basin]] if it does not receive sufficient water by October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7460492.stm |title=Australian rivers 'face disaster' |author=Bryant, Nick |date=June 18, 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water restrictions in Australia|Water restrictions]] are currently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from [[Drought in Australia|drought]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This helps with the understanding of hydroculture related plant propagation.

==Stem cutting==
Cut a green branch off of the desired plant above a node with a sterile cutting utensil. On the cut branch, trim off one or both sides, up to the length of next node. There should be one or two strips of bark running the length from below the bottom most node to the bottom of the cutting. Wet and dip this in rooting hormone if desired. Place the cutting into the aggregate. The more leaf area the cutting has, the more chances that the plant dries out, as a green stem is all that is necessary. Proper drainage is required: a substrate that has a higher water to air ratio attracts an-aerobic conditions and mold.

There are ways of improving the growth of stem cutting propagations. Intensifying light allows cuttings to root and sprout faster, apart from the concern that this could cause the propagation material distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;light cutting&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120123LopezBedding.html | title=Study shines light on ways to cut costs for greenhouse growers | publisher=Purdue University | work=Lopez and Currey | date=January 23, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2012 | author=Wallheimer, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azalea cuttings can be mildly heated in water to disinfect it from the fungus pathogen Rhizoctonia, and this could potentially be used for other plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;water treatment&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news180889087.html#nRlv | title=Hot Water Treatment Eliminates Rhizoctonia from Azalea Cuttings | publisher=Physorg | work=USDA Agricultural Research Service | date=December 24, 2009 | accessdate=July 31, 2012 | author=Yao, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seeds, bulbs and tubers==
Large seeds, bulbs and tubers (potatoes, avocado seeds) proved to be hardier than smaller propagation material. Propagation material is very delicate to minute water qualities. These minute water qualities are trivial to aquatic animal health. Ideally, keep the fish and other aquatic animals stress-free.

Some seeds need to have their coating removed, because it is susceptible to rot. Removing the seed coat, on certain species, also allows for quicker propagation.

==Grafting==
{{see|w:Grafting}}
[[w:Grafting|Grafting]] is not specific to hydroculture, but it may be used. A reason may be, to grow different varieties of a species of the same genus on one plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Beginnings==

The Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago as theorized by the Big Bang. Life did not arise on the primordial earth due to reducing conditions and super-hot climates. After billions of years; however, signs of molecules began to arise. It was not until 3.9 billion years ago did these molecules begin to form into protobionts. The early reducing atmosphere and conditions on earth also promoted organic synthesis. Energy was everywhere on earth due to climate, lightning, ultra-violet rays and volcanoes. The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis was proposed to explain earth's early conditions and help shed light on how the first molecules were formed. Other theories have hypothesized that the Earth could have been bombarded by asteriods that contained both D and L amino acids, but as billions of years passed the L-isomer amino acid predominated and is in all organisms today.

Evidence of Life's History: By studying fossils and through relative dating and absolute dating, geologists were able to establish a geologic record of the Earth’s history. Fossils are the remains of ancient life or activity. Types of fossils include imprint fossils, trace fossils, petrification, and amber. Relative dating provides a geologic time scale. The principle of superposition states that in sedimentary rocks, the highest stratum is the youngest and vice versa. Absolute dating is a technique that use radioactive isotopes and half life of elements to determine the actual ages of strata in geological column.     

The current geologic record divides Earth’s history into three eons: the Archaean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic eons. The Archaean and Proterozoic eons lasted approximately 4 billion years together leaving the Phanerozoic eon to encompass the most recent 500 million years of Earth’s history [2]. 

The Phanerozoic eon represents most of the time for the existence of animals on Earth. This eon is split into three eras on the geologic record: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.

[[Image:Geologic Clock - with events and periods - remake.png|thumb|The geologic record depicted as a clock analogy [3].]]

==Early Earth - Precambrian Era (4.5 Billion Years ago - 545 Million Years Ago)==

Conditions on the earth before the Cambrian explosion and prior to the three domains of life we know today were very extreme and harsh. However, protobionts (organic molecules that formed abiotically) began to form through time and were theorized to be the first molecules, and the precursor to the prokaryotic cells. After a few billion years prokaryotic cells formed and along with these prokaryotes, cyanobacteria began to grow and photosynthesize, thus releasing oxygen into the atmosphere and changing the oxygen level of the earth. Prior to this earth had little to no oxygen. With newly diversified cells, bacteria began to conjugate. Conjugation of bacteria over time therefore led to single celled eukaryotes, the protist. As protist began to replicate and grow, multicellular eukaryotes began to arise and led to multicellular organisms. These conditions over time paved way for the massive Cambrian explosion where diversity of life on a massive scale took place.

Precambrium - Archean: 3.5 bya (billions years ago) - oldest fossils (of bacteria) found. There were only prokaryotes for the first 1.5 billions years of life. Fossil of cyanobacteria were found, they were oxygenic and could carry out photosynthesis. 2.7 bya - atmosphere accumulated Oxygen and iron precipitated out of the oceans. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Precambrium - Proterozoic: 1.9 bya - oldest Eukaryotes found. 1.2bya - multicellular eukaryotes -alga- found. 700mya, there were diverse algae and soft-bodied animals. 650mya - there was a massive glacier (snowball earth) cooling of earth. 540mya - Cambrian explosion - diverse animals and algae come about. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Oxygen Revolution==

During Earth’s history, there were many key events that resulted in major evolutions. One such event was the “oxygen revolution”. Most of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere was of a biological origin, particularly from the water-splitting step of photosynthesis in ancient cyanobacteria. The oxygen gas was first dissolved by the surrounding water. The oxygen gas then started to react with dissolved iron once the concentration of oxygen was high enough. This reaction produced iron oxide which precipitated to form sediments. As the oxygen gas concentration kept rising, the seas and lakes soon became saturated with oxygen gas and the oxygen started to “gas out” of the water and into the atmosphere [2]. The amount of atmospheric oxygen gas was increasing at a gradual rate between 2.3 and 2.7 billion years ago; however, the rate of oxygen gas being added to the atmosphere spiked up rapidly causing an increase of 1% to 10% of its present level [2]. This is known as the “oxygen revolution” and it had a huge impact of the life inhabiting Earth at the time. Many prokaryotic groups became extinct due to oxygen being toxic to these groups by attacking chemical bonds, inhibiting enzymes, and damaging the cells. The species that survived did so by inhabiting an anaerobic environment. Diverse adaptations also resulted from this revolution, one of which was cellular respiration. The oxygen revolution also brought about the first eukaryotes. The origin of the eukaryotes can be further explained by the endosymbiont theory.

==Paleozic Era (545 Million Years Ago - 251 Million Years Ago)==

The Paleozice Era is marked by the cambrian explosion in which organismic diversification exploded, forming different life forms on earth. Due to lack of a fossil record prior to the Paleozic era, little can be said about when the cambrian explosion actually occured but new novelty structures such as jaws,appendages, bones, and other features on today's organisms began to form. There were also marine diversification. The first vertebrates appeared 525 mya. THere were invasion of land by many. The first land plants and fungi formed 460mya. THe first land animal Arthropods appeared. Following this, the first insects was found 396mya. Furthermore, the first land vertebrate (amphibians) appeared 360mya. The appearance of amniotes (terresterial animal) in the late Paleozoic. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during this time the earth due to continental drift began to move together and form a supercontinent, pangea. There were a reduction of shallow coastal habitats and along came cold harsh interior climates. However, the Paleozoic Era ended with a mass extinction termed the Permian Crisis. During the Permian Period about 251 million years ago, 96% of species went extinct. This occurred because massive volcanic eruptions released SO2 and CO2, causing global warming feedback. This massive release of methane by the underwater volcanoes led to a change in ocean circulation and an anoxic ocean, or an ocean depleted of oxygen. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesozoic Era (251 - 65 Million Years ago)==

The Mesozoic era, also known as the age of the dinosaurs shows more growth and diversification in organisms. Gymnosperms appeared in the early Mesozoic. During the mid-mesozoic, dinosaurs were introduced. The late Jurassic introduced birds. Origin of mammals are from early Mesozoic. 127 mya angiosperms (flowering plants) appeared. Also during this time the earth due to continental drift Pangea began to break. The end of the Mesozoic era is also marked with another mass extinction (especially of dinosaurs),the Cretaceous Crisis, theorized to have been caused by a gigantic asteroid, hitting the area of Yucatan. Layers of iridium are found around this area, thus proving that there could have been a catastrophic asteroid hitting this area affecting the plants and organisms that lived around that area during that time. The global effects included (1) crustal material ejected into stratosphere, (2) widespread fires nearer to impact, (3) reduced photosynthesis for several years, and (4) reduced global temperatures.

==Cenozoic Era(65 Million Years Ago - Present)==

The Cenozoic also known as the age of mammals began after the extinction of all the dinosaurs (except birds). The first grass appeared 40mya. At the beginning of Pleistocene, 2mya, there were glaciations. Human evolution occured during this time. Homo-sapiens as we know today began to populate the earth 100,000 years ago. There are many misconceptions: our ancestors are not chimps, not half-stooped cave dwellers, and are not contemporaries of dinosaurs.
