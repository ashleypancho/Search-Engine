      <text xml:space="preserve">In this entry the editor states: 
&quot;Dumbledore eventually had all three Hallows, he lost his head and tried to unite them, and in putting on the ring brought on the curse in his arm that was to claim his life within a year&quot;

I believe the editor is incorrect in his assumption that Dumbledore tried to &quot;unite them.&quot;  How could he?  Harry had the cloak at the time Dumbledore found the ring - he did not lose his head over thinking he could unite the three horcruxes.  His reason for losing his head and not realizing there would probably be a curse on the ring is because for a flash of a moment he believed he could bring his younger sister back from the dead with the hallow.  His remorse was great, as was his need to express it to his deceased sister.  It had nothing to do with uniting the hallows.

:The unnamed editor above is correct. While Dumbledore had heard, apparently correctly, that the one who could unite all three Hallows would in fact conquer Death, the only way to conquer Death is to accept it. &quot;To the truly organized mind, Death is but the next great adventure.&quot; Dumbledore had accepted death at that point, and was not dismayed to learn that he had at best a year left, so uniting the Hallows was no longer something he would be interested in.
:Dumbledore never had all three Hallows, although when he had the Ring, he did know where all three of them are, as Harry does when he walks, effectively unarmed, to meet Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest in the next chapter. It is perhaps worthy of note that Harry releases the Stone and returns the Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, thus deliberately losing one of the Hallows and quite possibly ending the power of the second.
:I personally believe that the reason Dumbledore put the ring on his finger is because the Horcrux in the ring, like the locket Horcrux, was tempting him in order to attempt its own survival, and had led him to believe that by use of the Resurrection Stone he would be able to restore Ariana and Kendra to life. Dumbledore recognized the Stone for what it was, I am sure, and as the locket Horcrux read Ron's thoughts and acted to play against them, I am certain that the ring Horcrux would have read and played upon Dumbledore's thoughts. We won't, of course, ever know that; it is through Snape's memories that we learn what had happened, and Snape was not present when he put the ring on. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:39, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

:So why have I not corrected this? I haven't yet had the chance. There are a lot of other things wrong with it, and I would like to hold off on touching it until I have the necessary time to fix it right, and the actual book in front of me. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:50, 3 August 2007 (UTC)


A great deal of the discussion in the &quot;Greater Picture&quot; section of this page is spent talking about Dumbledore's plan to have Snape become the true master of the Elder Wand by killing him, and how things might have unfolded if the plan was successful. However, that was not Dumbledore's true plan. He meant to die as the final master of the Elder Wand, with the allegiance of the wand not transferring to anybody at all when he died. If his plan had worked, Snape would have killed Dumbledore on Dumbledore's orders, which would not have been recognized by the Elder Wand as a defeat. The Elder Wand would never afterward have had an allegiance to any living wizard, and as a result its bloody and dangerous cycle would have been stopped forever. --[[User:Ferday|Ferday]] ([[User talk:Ferday|talk]]) 19:07, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
:An intriguing theory, and one that should be in the Greater Picture as well... as you don't seem to have put it there in the five or more months since you posted this, I will add it myself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lowland Scots Lesson One: The Basics'''
[[Image:Flag of Scotland.svg|100px|right]]

==Articles==
English, has the words &quot;'''the'''&quot;, &quot;'''a'''&quot; and &quot;'''an'''&quot;. These words are called &quot;articles&quot; and are used to refer to concepts which are specific (the, which is ''definite'') or general (a and an, which are ''indefinite'').
*''A man. The man. A group of men. The men.

Some languages will have one but not the other. Some languages have niether. Scots has both, and the rules are slightly simpler than in English.

===The===
The Scottish word for &quot;'''the'''&quot; is also '''the''' (pronounced more like &quot;theh&quot; instead of how we pronounce it &quot;thuh&quot;) and it almost exactly like in English. The only difference is that it is also used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades, occupations, sciences and academic subjects. It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a possessive pronoun: the hairst (autumn), the Wadensday (Wednesday), awa tae the kirk (off to church), the nou (at the moment), the day (today), the haingles (influenza), the Laitin (Latin), The deuk ett the bit breid (The duck ate a piece of bread), the wife (my wife) etc.
*Scots: ''The hoond. The tree. The waw.''
*English: ''The dog. The tree. The wall.''

===A===
The Lowlands word for &quot;'''a'''&quot; and &quot;'''an'''&quot; is simply &quot;'''a'''&quot;.
*Scots: ''The hoose. A aiple. The loanin an a tree.''
*English: ''The house. An apple. The field and a tree.''

==Am, Is, are, was, were==
&quot;Am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, and &quot;are&quot; are the same in Scots, but &quot;was&quot; and &quot;were&quot; are simply &quot;wis&quot;, though &quot;were&quot; is sometimes &quot;war&quot; in the language.
*Scots: ''A am, she is, we are, he wis, thay wis/war.''
*English: ''I am, she is, we are, he was, they were.''

==Pronouns==
Words like &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; are pronouns. The Scottish system has a few differences over English, as you will see below:
* '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  ''I''
* '''me'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  ''me''
* '''ma'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  ''my''
* '''ye'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  ''singular &quot;you&quot;''
* '''he'''  ''he''
* '''his''' ''his''
* '''she'''  ''she''
* '''her''' ''her''
* '''him'''  ''him''
* '''it'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;  ''it''
* '''we'''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;   ''we''
* '''us'''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;  ''us, me''
* '''thay'''  ''they''
* '''thaim'''  ''them''
* '''thair''' ''their''
* '''yese'''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;  ''plural &quot;you&quot;''
* '''yer'''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;  ''your''

The most recognizable difference is the distinction between singular and plural &quot;you&quot;. English used to have the same distinction; it used &quot;thou&quot; for singular &quot;you&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; for plural &quot;you&quot;. However, &quot;thou&quot; fell into disuse, and &quot;ye&quot; took its place and became modern &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Yese/Youse&quot; would be used in a sentence such as, &quot;A lue&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; yese/youse&quot;, which translates to, &quot;I love you all&quot;. &quot;Ye&quot; would be used in all other cases, like &quot;Wha are ye?&quot;, meaning &quot;Who are you?&quot;
Scots:
*''Hou&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; are ye?''
*''Hou are yese?''
English:
*''How are you?'' (Friendly)
*''How are you?'' (More than one person) or ''How are you all?'' or ''How are all of you?''


*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;I&quot; when used to emphasize.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;us&quot; or &quot;hus&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;ma certes&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;you&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;hit&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;oo&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;hus&quot;, &quot;us&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;youse&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;your&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;amour&quot; or &quot;love&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;whitwey&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Prepositions==
Prepositions, like the name suggests, describe positions and the relationships between things. Some language courses choose to describe these in more advanced lessons, but it's difficult to form sentences without them. Here we will introduce a few basic prepositions, but we will discuss them in greater depth in a future lesson.
* '''in'''  ''in''
* '''on'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  ''on'' (as in ''I put my books '''on''' my desk'')
* '''unner'''  ''under'' (very similar to the English word)
* '''ahint'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  ''behind''
* '''wi''' ''with''
* '''neist tae'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  ''next to''
The number of sentences which you can now build with a minimal vocabulary has increased dramatically.
*Scots: ''We are in the hoose.''
*English: ''We are in the house.''


*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;ontae&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;aback&quot; or &quot;hinder&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;til&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Vocabulary list==
This is a vocabulary list. Some of these words have appeared previously in this lesson and some are new.

* '''aiple'''  ''apple''
* '''tree'''  ''tree''
* '''door'''  ''door''
* '''eat'''  ''eat, to eat''
* '''hair'''  ''hair, a small portion''
* '''dug'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  ''dog''
* '''cat'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  ''cat''
* '''meat'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  ''food''
* '''lassie'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ''girl''
* '''moose'''  ''mouse''
* '''waw'''  ''wall''
* '''reid'''  ''red''
* '''laddie'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;  ''boy''

* '''bide'''  ''to reside, live at, lodge, stay''


*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;duggie&quot;, &quot;hoond&quot;, or &quot;tike&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;baudrons&quot;, &quot;cheetie&quot;, &quot;pous&quot;, or &quot;pousie&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;farin&quot;, &quot;leevin&quot;, &quot;mealtith&quot;, or &quot;fuid&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;lassie&quot; or &quot;quean&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;callant&quot;, &quot;lad&quot;, &quot;boy&quot;, or &quot;loun&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;buird&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;grugous&quot;, &quot;ill-farrant&quot;, &quot;uggsome&quot;, or &quot;ougly&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;lea&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Practice==

* ''Ye are John.''
* ''The hoose is reid.''

* ''The lassie wi black hair.''
* ''The dug sleeps unner a tree.''
* ''The cat eats the meat.''
* ''A sit on the chyre neist tae the table.''
* ''Yese are ahint the door in the waw.''
Translate these sentences into Lowland Scots.
* ''I am Jack.''
* ''It is under the table.''
* ''The door is in the red wall.''
* ''The mouse lives under the house.''
* ''A dog is sleeping behind the chair.''
* ''The tree is in the field.''
* ''The boy with food.''
* ''You eat an apple.''

==Answers==
Answers to the above excercises.
* ''You are John.''
* ''The house is red.''
* ''She lives in the city.''
* ''The girl with black hair.''
* ''The dog sleeps/is sleeping under a tree.''
* ''The cat eats/is eating the food.''

* ''The laddie wi the meat.''
* ''Ye eat an aiple.''

==End of lesson one==
That concludes the very first Lowland Scots lesson, and by now you should already be able to form simple sentences. Use the vocabulary you have learned to form your own sentences!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==IMHO==
I think this book starts out far too complexly.  There is no need for such complex ideas to be presented right off the bat. Doing so is only going to discourage programmers from reading on. I am going to start rewriting this and other pages so that the pages reflect the level of knowledge readers would have at that point.

Why does every article here emphasize how '''''object-oriented''''' C# is? Bolding it and waving it around and such? Yeah, I get it. This language is just like every other language. But to be honest, it isn't always a compliment. [[Special:Contributions/75.71.222.111|75.71.222.111]] ([[User talk:75.71.222.111|talk]]) 00:40, 17 March 2010 (UTC)

The page need to be improved it does not suit for a beginner student.

'''Asparagus with Sesame Seeds and Soy Sauce''' pairs very well with grilled beef, lamb or salmon.  It can also be served chilled as part of a brunch menu.  Asparagus is high in folic acid and fibre.  Using organic ingredients enhances taste, health and the environment.

Serves 4.

==Ingredients==
*20 to 32 [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] spears, preferably thin
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] (30 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] 
*1 tbsp (15 ml) sesame seed oil
*2 tbsp (30 ml) [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seed]] (If available, use Gomasio instead, and omit the salt. (see tips below))
*Kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Equipment==
*Steaming pot, bamboo steamer or asparagus steamer

==Procedure==
#Prepare steamer and bring water to a boil.
#Trim asparagus spears in half, discarding (or composting) the thicker ends.
#Steam the asparagus for 8-10 minutes, until tender, but still crisp.
#Heat a small skillet or frying pan on medium heat. Add the sesame seeds and shake or stir.  They are done when they just begin to darken and give off a pleasant toasted aroma.  Be careful not to leave unattended as they can easily burn.
#Remove asparagus from steamer, shake to drain water, and arrange on serving plate.
#Drizzle the soy sauce and the sesame oil over the asparagus.
#Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and give a very light sprinkle with the Kosher salt.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
One way to gauge the best place to cut an asparagus spear is to gently grasp each end and bend the spear.  The point at which is begins to break is where the stem begins to become tougher.

Gomasio is a Japanese seasoning made with sesame seeds and salt.  I obtain mine at a local health food store.  It can also be spelled Gomashio.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Copyright and Patents in the Internet Age=

==History of Copyright and Patents==

===Early History===
Printing press initiated copyright regulations ...
Monarchy maintained them
Later parliament maintained them and police tried to enforce them (which wasn't
feasible).

===U.S. Constitutional Basis for Copyright and Patent Law===
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants the Congress the power, among other things,
&lt;pre&gt;
To promote the progress of science and useful arts, 
by securing for limited times to authors and inventors 
the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html#science%20and%20useful%20arts

==Patent Law==
Most content in this section comes from the FTC/DOJ 2003 report on
Patents and Competition 

===What is a patent?===
A patent is essentially a monopoly on creation of a product or method for creating a product (or providing a service) granted by the government for a limited periodof time (usually 20 years from date of file or 17 years from date of grant, which ever comes first).

There are three types of patents
* utility patent (new invention or process)
* design patent (new original or ornamental design for a manufactured object)
** Examples of design patent application drawings: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/design/drawing.html
* plant patent (patent on a new variety of plant)

For further information see the Wikibooks on [[US Patent Law]] or [[Canadian Patent Law]].

===How can a patent promote the progress of science and useful arts===
A patent guarantees exclusive rights to the inventor for a given period of time and this by consequence enhances the the ability for commercialization and may be an incentive to foster innovation.
 
* inventor has 20 years to recoup research and development costs
* inventor may have easier time getting financing 
* with venture capital it should allow small firms to compete with big ones, but small firms may have trouble litigating.

{{NOTE|Litigation and market pressures makes patents an effective weapon to prevent the creation of direct competition. This allied with a lax policy of attribution of patents, has been proven a barrier for innovation.}}

===How might patents serve to slow the progress of useful arts?===
It may discourage innovation because once the exclusivity of a patent exists
no one else is allowed to build on that specific idea without paying royalties
to the patent holder (or breaking the law).  
* the advent of 'patent thickets' can create an environment where it is difficult to remain competitive without infringement.  
* a monopolist may create higher prices and lower availability of the product
* a monopolist can inhibit add-on innovation

==How can competition without patents promote the progress of science and useful arts==
With no restrictions on further development of a product, innovators are free
to begin to improve the product as soon as it is made public.

===Innovation -- what are the competitive advantages to funding R&amp;D independent of patents===
An R&amp;D infrastructure would become experienced in the area of interest and would
be more capable of follow-on innovation.  

===Commercialization===

====What are the competitive advantages to commercializing ideas one develops====

{{FA X|'''Never''' confront any suspected abusers.&lt;br&gt;'''Never''' judge whether or not a complaint is true or not. Always treat any complaint in a serious manner.}}

'''Abuse:''' is when a person's well-being is deliberately and intentionally threatened. In some jurisdictions, if you are a health care provider then you may be obligated to report abuse or neglect that you observe. In particular, if you are in any position of authority in relation to a child, you are likely required by law to report child abuse.

If you are not under a professional duty of care, it is strongly recommended that you report any instances of suspected abuse.  Stick to reporting the facts, and let the authorities determine the truth of any suspicion.  Never confront the potential abuser yourself - consider your own safety.

The most vulnerable groups are the young and elderly, but be aware of the potential for abuse in all people (such as abuse of a spouse of either gender).

;Physical abuse
:abuse involving contact intended to cause pain, injury, or other physical suffering or harm
;Emotional abuse
:a long-term situation in which one person uses his or her power or influence to adversely affect the mental well-being of another. Emotional abuse can appear in a variety of forms, including rejection, isolation, exploitation, and terror.
;Sexual abuse
:is defined by the forcing of undesired sexual acts by one person to another.
;Neglect
:a category of maltreatment, when there is a failure to provide for the proper physical care needs of a dependent.

Some forms of abuse may be more obvious such as physical abuse but the rest may be concealed depending on the victim. If you notice any whip marks, burns, bruises with an unexplained origin, slap marks, bite marks, etc., you may suspect abuse. 

If the person's life is in immediate danger then you should contact emergency medical services.  As a first aider you are in a good position to do this without suspicion - if questioned you should state that you believe the victim requires further treatment.  If possible, you should request police assistance, although not if you are in the presence of the suspected abuser. To help with this, some ambulances operate a safeword system (usually for their crews) which can be entered in to the call to flag an abuse query.  These are not widely published (to protect their usage), but if you work for a recognized organization, they may be willing to share this word with you or your group.

If the person's safety is not in immediate danger, you should contact your local government department which deals with accusations of abuse, which may vary within locations by the demographics of the person being abused (child, elder, learning difficulties etc.).  If in doubt, contact your local police, who should be able to signpost you to the most appropriate service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This section will define the naming conventions that are generally accepted by the C# development community. Some companies may define naming conventions that differ from this, but that is done on an individual basis and is generally discouraged. Some of the objects discussed in this section may be beyond the reader's knowledge at this point, but this section can be referred back to later.

==Reasoning== 
Much of the naming standards are derived from Microsoft's .NET Framework libraries. These standards have proven to make names readable and understandable &quot;at a glance&quot;. By using the correct conventions when naming objects, you ensure that other C# programmers who read your code will easily understand what objects are without having to search your code for their definition.

==Conventions==
===Namespace===
Namespaces are named using [[w:Pascal Case|Pascal Case]] (also called {{C sharp|UpperCamelCase}}) with no underscores. This means the first letter of every word in the name is capitalized. For example: {{C sharp|MyNewNamespace}}. Also, note that Pascal Case also denotes that acronyms of three or more letters should only have the first letter capitalized (MyXmlNamespace instead of MyXMLNamespace).

===Assemblies===
If an assembly contains only one namespace, they should use the same name. Otherwise, Assemblies should follow the normal Pascal Case format.

===Classes and Structures===
Pascal Case, no underscores or leading {{C sharp|C}}, {{C sharp|cls}}, or {{C sharp|I}}. Classes should not have the same name as the namespace in which they reside. Any acronyms of three or more letters should be pascal case, not all caps. Try to avoid abbreviations, and try to always use nouns.

===Exception Classes===
Follow class naming conventions, but add Exception to the end of the name. In .Net 2.0, all classes should inherit from the {{C sharp|System.Exception}} base class, and not inherit from the {{C sharp|System.ApplicationException}}.

===Interfaces===
Follow class naming conventions, but start the name with {{C sharp|I}} and capitalize the letter following the {{C sharp|I}}. Example: {{C sharp|IFoo}} The {{C sharp|I}} prefix helps to differentiate between Interfaces and classes and also to avoid name collisions.

===Functions===
Pascal Case, no underscores except in the event handlers. Try to avoid abbreviations. Many programmers have a nasty habit of overly abbreviating everything. This should be discouraged.

===Properties and Public Member Variables===
Pascal Case, no underscores. Try to avoid abbreviations.

===Parameters and Procedure-level Variables===
Camel Case (or {{C sharp|lowerCamelCase}}). Try to avoid abbreviations. Camel Case is the same as Pascal case, but the first letter of the first word is lowercased.

===Class-level Private and Protected Variables===
Camel Case with a leading underscore. Always indicate {{C sharp|protected}} or {{C sharp|private}} in the declaration. The leading underscore is the only controversial thing in this document. The leading character helps to prevent name collisions in constructors (a parameter and a private variable having the same name).

===Controls on Forms===
Pascal Case with a prefix that identifies it as being part of the UI instead of a purely coded control (example a temporary variable). Many developers use {{C sharp|ui}} as the prefix followed by a descriptive name such as {{C sharp|txtUserName}} or {{C sharp|lblUserNickName}} (&quot;txt&quot; stands for TextBox control and &quot;lbl&quot; for Label control)

Some samples are below for ASP.Net web form controls:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Control !! Prefix !! Example
|-
| Label || lbl || lblSurname
|-
| TextBox || txt || txtSurname
|-
| DataGrid || dg || dgResults
|-
| GridView || gv || gvResults2
|-
| Button || btn || btnSave
|-
| ImageButton || iBtn || iBtnSave
|-
| Hyperlink || lnk || lnkHomePage
|-
| DropDownList || ddl || ddlCompany
|-
| ListBox || lst || lstCompany
|-
| DataList || dLst || dlstAddress
|-
| DataSet || ds || dsInvoices
|-
| DataTable || dt || dtClients
|-
| DataRow || dr || drUser
|-
| Repeater || rep || repSection
|-
| Checkbox || chk || chkMailList
|-
| CheckBoxList || chk || chkAddress
|-
| RadioButton || rBtn || rBtnSex
|-
| RadioButtonList || rBtn || rBtnAgeGroup
|-
| Image || img || imgLogo
|-
| Panel || pnl || pnlSevtion
|-
| PlaceHolder || plh || plhHeader
|-
| Calendar || txt|| txtMyDate
|-
| AdRotator || adr || adrBanner
|-
| Table || tbl || tblResults
|-
| [All] Validators || val (N/A) || valCreditCardNumber
|-
| ValidationSummary || vals (N/A) || valsErrors
|}

===Constants===
Pascal Case. The use of SCREAMING_CAPS is discouraged. This is a large change from earlier conventions. Most developers now realize that in using SCREAMING_CAPS they betray more implementation than is necessary. A large portion of the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/czefa0ke .NET Framework Design Guidelines] is dedicated to this discussion.

==Example== 
Here is an example of a class that uses all of these naming conventions combined.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

namespace MyExampleNamespace
{
    public class Customer : IDisposable
    {
        private string _customerName;
        public string CustomerName 
        { 
            get 
            { 
                return _customerName; 
            }
            set
            {
                _customerName = value;
                _lastUpdated = DateTime.Now;
            }
        }

        private DateTime _lastUpdated;

        public DateTime LastUpdated
        {
            get
            {
                return _lastUpdated;
            }
            private set
            {
                _lastUpdated = value;
            }
        }

        public void UpdateCustomer(string newName)
        {
            if (!newName.Equals(CustomerName))
            {
                CustomerName = newName;
            }
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            //Do nothing
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Would it be better to get an image of just an inhaler for the image of asthma inhalers?  The first one is of Advair which doesn't replace a fast-acting inhaler for sudden symptoms. [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 22:45, 23 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] awakens in the early hours, pondering the daunting task [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] gave him and the tales about Albus' young life. Bored, he explores the mansion. On the second landing, the room [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Harry previously used has been searched, presumably by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] room on the next floor has also been searched; amid the mess is a handwritten letter from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]] to Sirius thanking him for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|toy broomstick]] he gave Harry for his first birthday. A half-torn photo shows baby Harry riding the broomstick. The letter's second page is also missing, but the first one mentions [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], a famous wizard historian who often visits, and that Dumbledore borrowed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. The letter ends halfway through Lily's sentence saying that she is, &quot;surprised that Dumbledore...&quot; Harry searches unsuccessfully for the second page. 

Harry shows [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] what he found and immediately wants to go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] to meet Bathilda Bagshot and ask about his parents and the Dumbledore family. Hermione believes it is too dangerous and unrelated to their mission. Harry then notices [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]]'s full name posted on a door; it matches the initials [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 28|R.A.B.]] on the note found inside the fake Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Hermione calls [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Alohomora|unlocks the door]]. Inside, they hunt for Slytherin's Locket, but find nothing. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 6|remembers]] a locket that no one could open and was tossed away. Harry suspects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], the Black family [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] who was continually retrieving discarded items, may have hidden it. 

Kreacher says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] stole the locket; he also tells them that when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] required a House-elf, his master, Regulus Black, gave him Kreacher. At a lake inside a cave, Voldemort forced Kreacher to drink a potion from a basin that made him think horrible thoughts. Voldemort placed a locket into the emptied basin and refilled it with more potion. Kreacher, abandoned and in misery, crawled to the water to drink, only to be dragged under the surface. However, Kreacher, as ordered, returned to his master.

Regulus, rejecting Voldemort's beliefs, apparently discovered the Locket was a Horcrux and had Kreacher take him to the cave. Kreacher was ordered to force Regulus to drink all the potion, then to replace the real Locket with a fake one. After consuming the potion, Regulus, thirsty, drank from the lake, only to be pulled under by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]]. Kreacher was unable to destroy the real Locket as he had been ordered. Because he was commanded to reveal nothing, Kreacher alone knew Regulus' fate. Kreacher, distraught over failing his master, sobs uncontrollably.

Harry, though still upset by Kreacher's part in Sirius' death, is bothered more by Voldemort exploiting Kreacher. Hermione explains [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]] are used to brutal treatment, so he never resented Voldemort's abuse. Also, from Kreacher's perspective, Sirius betrayed the Black family by leaving home. The Trio must now find the Locket. Harry wins Kreacher's allegiance by telling him that their mission is to destroy the Locket, as Regulus wanted. When he gives Kreacher the fake locket, Kreacher is overcome by receiving a Black family heirloom. Harry then orders the elf to fetch Mundungus. Kreacher [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]] to find him.

== Analysis ==

While much information regarding the Trio's Horcrux quest is revealed, Harry's relationship to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], the house he inherited from Sirius Black, should also be examined. The house, which seems frozen in the past, provides the Trio a safe haven. Harry was happy here during his brief visits with Sirius, but he hardly considers it home, nor does he now find it comforting. Instead, its murky, decaying interior is filled with sad reminders of Harry's lost godfather who endured his own unhappy childhood there. Like the fugitive Sirius, who was long confined inside as the Ministry hunted him, Harry finds the residence to be as much a bleak prison as it is a protective refuge. Even its name reflects its grimness. The Trio must also contend with Kreacher, the belligerent House-elf Harry also inherited, and the fanatical [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Mrs. Black]]'s screaming portrait. As depressing as Grimmauld Place might be, however, for now, it is secure and comfortable, and Kreacher, fully under Harry's control, is unable to betray them, though given the opportunity, he probably would if he was able to. The house has also yielded a fortuitous, if unexpected, result: a clue leading to a Horcrux. 

Although many readers correctly guessed the answer, one of the most intriguing mysteries in the series, R.A.B.'s identity, is finally definitively solved. Regulus Arcturus Black is arguably the most important ''unseen'' character in the series. Like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], Regulus quickly learned that being a Death Eater required far more unpleasantness than he had ever imagined or could provide. And once recruited, there is no leaving the Dark Lord's service alive. Unable to escape with his life, Regulus instead devised the plan to steal what he clearly believed to be Voldemort's single Horcrux, certain he would be killed in the process, but dying in the belief that he had helped to thwart the Dark Lord. 

More is also learned about Regulus' and Kreacher's characters, their relationship with each other, with Voldemort, and what motivated them. Until now, the fanatically faithful Black family House-elf has been seen only as a rather nasty and unpleasant servant who is forced by circumstance to serve Harry, and who, if possible, would probably use any means to expose him to Voldemort. Not only does Kreacher's story explain how Regulus recovered the Locket Horcrux, but it also spotlights the callous ill-treatment the Wizarding world inflicts upon enslaved House-elves, and what little regard there is for their well-being or personal rights. 

Harry remains conflicted over Kreacher, repulsed and angry that he betrayed Sirius to Voldemort, but also sympathetic to how the House-elf was exploited by the Dark Lord. Hermione explains that House-elves expect to be mistreated, and Harry comes to understand that they are hapless pawns, often abused and misused at their master's discretion. Even the name &quot;Kreacher&quot; (creature) implies that he and other House-elves are considered as little more than domesticated animals, albeit intelligent talking ones whose sole purpose and identity is to serve their wizard masters. Although he appears to be a despicable, inconsolable (and half-mad) wretch, Kreacher's character has been molded by the maltreatment heaped on him over the years, and by anguish over having to conceal Regulus' fate, probably coupled with remorse for being involved in it, and failing to follow his Master's final orders. Like many wizards, Sirius also treated the House-elf poorly or indifferently, though their mutual loathing was a contributing factor. Under Harry's continued kind, gentle treatment, however, it is possible that Kreacher could be transformed; even by the this chapter's end, after a very short interaction with Harry, he already seems far more willing to do Harry's bidding than we have ever seen.

As a small side light here, we should note Kreacher's return to his master. After being pulled under the lake by the Inferi, Kreacher had &quot;come back&quot;. He never explains, he simply says he had returned to his master. It is a fair supposition that he used the House-elf form of Apparition to do so, and perhaps it is just something that he naturally does and it therefore lacks a name. We already have seen that House-elves can Apparate within Hogwarts, where the school's protective charms normally prevent Apparition. Voldemort has presumably prevented Apparition in the Horcrux cave to force any would-be thieves into running the gantlet&lt;!-- check definition of this word before changing it please --&gt; of the lake and the Inferi. Equally, however, he clearly has failed to prevent House-elves from Apparating in the cave. Whether this is an oversight on Voldemort's part, which would support the readers' belief in his discounting non-Human magic, or whether it is simply impossible for human spell-casters to prevent Elf Apparition, is unknown.

Lily's letter to Sirius Black is a typical thank-you note and unlikely containing anything Death Eaters would consider important. That makes it even more intriguing as to why only its second half is missing. What remains provides useful information for Harry, however. Lily mentions the elderly Bathilda Bagshot, a famous wizard historian who lives in Godric's Hollow, who Lily apparently was acquainted with, and may know much about the Dumbledore clan. Harry immediately wants to go to Godric's Hollow, not only to meet Bathilda and learn more about Dumbledore and his family from her, but also to see his birthplace. Hermione vetoes this, arguing that it is unrelated to their mission, too dangerous, and she suspects Voldemort may have set a trap there. Hermione instead encourages Harry to trust his own feelings and memories about Dumbledore, rather than believing malicious rumors and unsubstantiated innuendos spread by Ron's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Aunt Muriel]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], and others.

The letter also mentions that Dumbledore borrowed James' Invisibility Cloak, though for what purpose is still unknown. This reminds us that Dumbledore had this Cloak in his possession when James died, and perhaps is intended to pique the reader's curiosity as to why he might have wanted it. The letter is also significant in that it is probably the first time Harry has seen his mother's handwriting or read her own words. For Harry, who has tended to identify with his father more than his mother, it awakens new-found feelings that tie him closer to her. It also shows yet another means by which the dead are able to speak from beyond the grave and affect the living.

The torn photograph adds to the mystery. Presumably its missing half contained either James' or Lily's image, proudly watching their young son flying about on his first toy broomstick. Just why someone would take the ripped half is unknown, and certainly curious.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===

#Harry wants to meet with Bathilda Bagshot to learn more about Dumbledore. Who else might have been interested in talking to Bathilda about him and why?
#Why does Hermione tell Harry to rely on his own memories about Dumbledore, rather than what others have to say? 
#How has Kreacher's behavior toward Harry changed? What might account for this?
#Why didn't Kreacher destroy the Locket Horcrux? Given what is known about Horcruxes and Elf magic, could he have destroyed it?
#Why is Harry both judgmental and sympathetic to Kreacher? What is Hermione's explanation and do Ron and Harry agree?

=== Further Study ===

#Why would only the second page of Lily's letter's and her image from the photo be missing? Who might have taken them?
#What could Harry learn about his parents and Dumbledore from talking to Bathilda Bagshot? Would her revelations be any more truthful, accurate, or unbiased than anyone else's?
#Why does Hermione advise Harry against going to Godric's Hollow or talking to Bathilda Bagshot? Should Harry listen to her advice? Explain.
#Harry suspects Death Eaters searched Grimmauld Place. Why might that assumption be wrong? Who might have searched it and why?
#How did Regulus Black know that the Locket was a Horcrux? Why was he willing to forfeit his life to destroy it?
#Kreacher says the potion he was forced to drink made him think horrible thoughts. Based on what is known about his character, what might those thoughts have been?
#Why would Regulus drink the potion, knowing it was likely harmful, rather than order Kreacher or some other House-elf to do so?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The missing half of Lily's letter and the torn photograph are significant, though not in the way readers might expect. It was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] who took the letter and the photo (with Lily's image), apparently for personal reasons rather than because they contained any vital information relating to Voldemort, Dumbledore, or the Order of the Phoenix.

The letter's mentioning that Dumbledore borrowed James' Invisibility Cloak is also significant. It will be learned that the Cloak is one of the three titular Deathly Hallows. Dumbledore's wand is another Hallow, and he was searching for the third, apparently hoping that the three Deathly Hallow's legendary ability to conquer death would reunite him with his lost family. 

It is never explained how Regulus discovered that the Locket was a Horcrux. He also apparently never understood how to dispatch one, as he only directed Kreacher to take and destroy it, apparently assuming any strong magical charm would do the job. Kreacher, unable to destroy it with conventional magic, merely kept it. Harry has already learned, by means of Hermione's research, that there are only a few methods to destroy these Dark magical objects, and he must find some alternative means to eliminate Voldemort's Horcruxes. Like Regulus, Harry will likewise task someone (Neville Longbottom) to kill the last Horcrux in the event that he, Ron, or Hermione are unable to during the Battle at Hogwarts. Harry, unfortunately, neglects to instruct Neville on just how to accomplish this, leaving Neville to his own devices.

Kreacher being able to easily Apparate in and out of Voldemort's highly secure sea cave demonstrates how Elf magic differs from wizard magic. This ability, which we have now seen several times in Hogwarts, will be seen again in a later chapter when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] rescues the imprisoned Trio and several others by Apparating into a magically protected area. This ability also underscores a major weakness in Voldemort&amp;mdash;a failure to consider that anyone he considers inferior could actually be more powerful magically.

Also, Hermione's fears about Godric's Hollow will prove to be well-founded, though it will later be her idea to go there.

=== Connections ===
* Sirius having sent Harry a broom for his first birthday, as mentioned in this chapter, echoes Sirius' later purchase of a Firebolt racing broom for Harry at Christmas in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 11|Harry's second year at Hogwarts]]. At the time, of course, it is unknown who had sent it; Sirius reveals his role [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 22|near the end of that book]].</text>

== BasicStamp ==

The BasicStamp family of microcontrollers is manufactured by Parallax. The BasicStamps contain a Microchip PIC microcontroller unit preloaded with a PBASIC interpreter program, a voltage regulator, and a flash memory unit. The benefits are the power and small size of the PIC controller, with the added benefits of extended memory and the PBASIC instruction language, which is easier to understand and use then the PIC assembly language.

== About this Book ==

This book is written both as an introduction to PBASIC programming, but also to embedded programming in general. For a more in-depth look at embedded systems and embedded programming, see [[Embedded Systems]]. 

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book is for anybody interested in learning to program embedded systems. One of the primary uses of the BasicStamp, at least in terms of education, is robotics. Parallax sells a number of robotics kits that are based off the BasicStamp architecture. Beyond the use in robotics, there are a number of other areas where BasicStamps can be used with great success.

An accompanying course at Wikiversity, [[Wikiversity:Introduction to Robotics|Introduction to Robotics]] will be using this textbook and the BasicStamp architecture to teach students about robotics.

== What are the Prequisites? ==

Students should have a basis of understanding in elementary algebra. No prior programming experience is required. The use of and interpretation of graphs will also be a useful skill, but is not strictly required. A background in chemistry or physics where mathematics is used to model physical phenomina will also be helpful. The reader should be able to read and understand metric system units, and be able to make simple conversions between units. For instance, the reader should know that 1000 microseconds are in 1 millisecond. 

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will attempt to look at the PBASIC programming language as it is used in practice: in an embedded application. Therefore, we will need to discuss certain things that aren't purely software, such as voltage and electric circuits, sensors and actuators, etc. We attempt to keep discussions on these subjects as simple as possible, so that the reader can use the concepts in their project, but don't get weighted down with complicated mathematical theory. We do, however, need to provide enough explanation of certain concepts that the reader can employ them safely and effectively. 

== Are There Any Aides for This Book? ==

There is a robotics course at Wikiversity that uses the BasicStamp and the PBASIC language to operate simple robots. That course uses this book as it's primary text. If the reader is interested in robotics, and would also like some hands-on assignments to help demonstrate the concepts learned in this book, it is recommended that they also participate in the Wikiversity course. The course is located here:

*[[v:Introduction to Robotics|Introduction to Robotics]]

Because of it's focus on robotics, the Wikiversity course may present information in a slightly different order from the way it is present here, and it may also focus more or less of different topics.</text>

== Microcontrollers ==

A modern desktop computer contains a special type of chip called a &quot;Microprocessor&quot;. Microprocessors are common, and you hear about them all the time: &quot;Pentium&quot;, &quot;Athlon&quot;, &quot;Core 2 Duo&quot;, etc. A microprocessor can do certain math calculations and it can execute instructions, but it relies on the rest of your computer (mother board, RAM, etc) to operate. Take away one of the other parts of the system, and your computer will not work.

Similar to a microprocessor is the '''microcontroller''', a smaller type of device that is more self-reliant. Microcontrollers do not need a special motherboard, or a special power supply, or even additional RAM to operate: you can plug them in and they will work perfectly. Microcontrollers are also typically very small and cheap as well, making them a good addition to almost any design project.

Microcontrollers can be found in all sorts of devices, anywhere from a cellular phone to a digital microwave to your car and your television. If you have something that has buttons, or something more complicated then a paper weight, it probably has a microcontroller inside.

== MicroChip PIC ==

A common and popular type of microcontroller is the PIC, made by a company called Microchip. PIC is not just one microcontroller, but a whole family of them, each with a different size, different shape, different abilities, and a different price. Because of the large range of options, the small size, and the low price, PIC microncontrollers have been very popular devices among hobbyists and engineers. However, PICs have a number of different problems that make their use more difficult:
#They are difficult to program. Some PICs can only be programmed once, which means that you can't make any mistakes (and everybody makes mistakes). For PICs that can be reprogrammed, you need to either build a programmer or you need to buy one. Programmers are relatively complex circuits and can be tough to build. However, the programmers that you can buy might be very expensive.
#They are programmed using an assembly language. Assembly language is very low-level, meaning that it is easier for a computer to understand, and harder for a human to understand. Also, programming in assembly requires you know know what is inside the microcontroller, the &quot;architecture&quot;, which can be very difficult indeed.
#They don't have power regulation. A PIC requires a separate power regulator circuit, to help prevent too much power from going into the chip and destroying it. Power regulators typically need to be built by hand, which can be tricky.

== BasicStamp ==

The Parallax company decided to use the PIC processor, but to make it easier for people to use. They took a very small version of the PIC, added memory for bigger programs, added a voltage regulator, added an oscillator, and they preprogrammed it with a BASIC interpreter. The result was the BasicStamp. BASIC is a family of computer programming languages which were designed to be very simple and easy to learn. It is much easier and faster to write a program in BASIC then it is to write the same program in PIC assembly. The designer now doesn't need to build any of the circuits that needed to be built with the PIC: no voltage regulator, no oscillator circuit, and no programmer. This helps to speed up development time. Projects using the BasicStamps can be smaller and simpler then projects using just PICs.

The version of BASIC used in the BasicStamp is called PBASIC. This book will discuss the PBASIC language as it applies to the BasicStamp.

Curves is a powerful tool found in The Gimp, it can be used for many things, such as fixing a colour cast.

----

To use the curves tool, go to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Tools &gt; Colour Tools &gt; Curves'' and you should see a window similar to this:

You can adjust the &quot;Value&quot; channel, which will brighten/darken the image depending on whether you drag the line up or down.
Down will darken, up will lighten.

You can also adjust the Red, Blue, Green, and Alpha channels.

If your picture has a green colour cast, open up Curves, switch to the green channel, then move the line toward the bottom a little bit, until the cast is gone.

You can also switch the curve style, from smooth to jagged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Koch's Snowflake is another geometric iterative fractal, based this time on an equilateral triangle. It was first published in 1906 by the Swede

The iterative step, like Cantor's Set, is applied to any remaining line segments. This step consists of splitting a line in 3, removing the middle third and replacing it with two copies of itself angled 60 degrees apart, to make a kink in the line similar to the equilateral triangle.

An interesting feature of this curve is how quickly it grows in complexity - the numer of edges increases by 4 with every iteration, with the length of the perimeter increasing by 4/3. This means that the actual Koch Snowflake has an infinite perimeter.

== Binary Numbers ==

When we think about numbers that we use every day, we are thinking about numbers in '''base 10'''. This means that there are 10 different digits that we can use: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Using these 10 digits and powers of 10, we can create any number in our system:

:&lt;math&gt;123 = 1 \times 10^2 + 2 \times 10^1 + 3 \times 10^0&lt;/math&gt;

In a '''binary''' or &quot;base 2&quot; system, we only have two digits: 0 and 1. To make a number in binary, we use powers of 2 instead of powers of 10:

:&lt;math&gt;10101 = 1 \times 2^4 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 21&lt;/math&gt;

When talking about numbers in different systems, it is common to use subscripts. A subscript of 10 means the number is in base 10, and a subscript of 2 means the number is in base 2. For instance:

:&lt;math&gt;1010_2 = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 10_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

== Common Data Types ==

Computers are very limited, and the space that they have to store numbers is fixed. This means that there are a certain number of bits available, no more and no less. Certain sizes of numbers are so common that they have special names.

=== Bit ===

A '''bit''' is a single binary number, either a 0 or a 1.

=== Nibble ===

A '''nibble''' is 4 bits, and can contain values from 0 to 15. 

=== Byte ===

A '''byte''' is 8 bits (2 nibbles) and can contain values from 0 to 255.

=== Word ===

A '''word''' is 16 bits long (2 bytes or 4 nibbles) and can contain values from 0 to 65535.

== Available Storage ==

The BASIC Stamp has 128 bytes (64 words) of data storage that can be used by your program as '''variables'''. We will discuss variables later.

== Limitations ==

There are a number of limitations when working with computer numbers. 

=== Negative Numbers ===

In order to support both positive and negative numbers, PBASIC needs to &quot;steal&quot; one of the bits from the number to represent the sign. Consequently, the range of all of our data types gets smaller:

;Bits:Bits cannot be signed.
;Nibble:Signed nibbles can go from -8 to 7
;Byte:Signed bytes can go from -128 to 127
;Word:Signed words can go from -32768 to 32767

Negative numbers are stored in a special way called '''two's complement'''. We will not cover this here.

=== Fractions ===

Some computers are capable of dealing with fractional numbers, called &quot;floating-point numbers&quot;. However, BASIC Stamps cannot deal with fractions. This means that whenever we try to use a fraction, the BASIC Stamp will ''always round down''. This means that the number 1.9 will become 1 inside the BASIC Stamp. Some people may find it strange that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

However in computers, this is common.

=== Overflow ===

Datatypes have a fixed width, and they cannot hold numbers that are too big. If we try to store a number too big in a variable, the top-most bits will be &quot;chopped off&quot;. If we are talking about bytes, we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;255 + 2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is called '''overflow''', and is something that we need to pay attention to when doing arithmetic. If a byte or a nibble is too small, we can always use words instead. But if we want to store a number that is greater then 65535, then we are in trouble!

== Writing Numbers ==

There are several ways that a programmer may wish to specify a number: Binary, Decimal, or Hexadecimal. Hexadecimal, which we won't discuss in this book, is another useful number system using a base of 16.

To write a decimal number, we just write the number with no prefix, such as: &quot;99&quot;. If we want to write a binary number, we use the &quot;%&quot; prefix, such as: &quot;%110011&quot;. To write in hexadecimal, we would use the &quot;$&quot; prefix as so: &quot;$AF99&quot;. 

=== ASCII ===

In a computer, everything is stored in binary. This means that even things that aren't numbers, such as letters or other characters, are stored using binary numbers. There is a special code that assigns every character to a special binary pattern called '''ASCII'''. To write a letter in ASCII, we use the double-quotes such as:

 MyVariable = &quot;A&quot;

Notice that a number and the ASCII code for that digit are not the same value:

 MyVariable = 1

 MyVariable = &quot;1&quot;

These two are not the same! However, ASCII has a special property that all the characters and digits are arranged from lowest to highest, and so we can do math with ASCII characters in some instances:

 MyVariable = &quot;A&quot; + 1

Now MyVariable is equal to &quot;B&quot;! Also, we can convert digits into regular binary numbers by using a simple relation:

 MyVariable = &quot;1&quot; - &quot;0&quot;

Now MyVariable is equal to the binary number 1. We will discuss variables more later, but these examples should be self-explanatory for now.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PBASIC/Page}}

== Arithmetic Operators ==

We can use some of the basic arithmetic operators for common operations. Operators can be used with variables, constants, or numbers.

=== Common Operators ===

;Addition:To add two numbers together, we use the &quot;+&quot; operator:
 Var1 + Var2
;Subtraction:To subtract one number from the other, we use the &quot;-&quot; operator:
 Var1 - Var2
;Multiplication:To multiply, we use the &quot;*&quot; operator:
 Var * Var2
;Division:To divide two numbers, we use the &quot;/&quot; operator:
 Var1 / Var2

=== Other Math Functions ===

;Power: We can use exponents with the &quot;**&quot; operator:
 Var1 ** Var2

== Assignment ==

We can use the &quot;=&quot; operator to assign a value to a variable. For instance, we can write:

 MyVar VAR Byte
 MyVar = 10

 MyVar VAR Byte
 MyVar = 10 + 5

 MyVar VAR Byte
 MyVar2 VAR Byte
 MyVar = 10
 MyVar2 = MyVar + 10

We can also write a ''self-assignment'', or an assignment where a variable appears on the left and the right side of the statement:

 MyVar VAR Byte
 MyVar = 10
 MyVar = MyVar + 1

On the third line of this program, MyVar equals 10, and then we add one and store the new result into MyVar again. After this program runs, MyVar contains the value of 11.

== Overflow and Underflow ==

Overflow occurs when we attempt to store a number in a variable that is too large for that variable. For instance, if we try to store a number that is larger then 255 in a Byte, or a number that is larger then 65535 in a word. Underflow is the exact opposite problem, where we attempt to create a negative number that is so low that the variable cannot hold it.</text>

== Need for Storage ==

When we write a program, it's always a good thing to be able to store data that we are using, and to manipulate that data. If we want to set aside some storage for a particular use, we need to tell the computer to save that space, and we need to give the space a name. A variable is a storage location, like a box or a shelf in real life, that has a name. Think about the common algebraic equation for a straight line:

:&lt;math&gt;y = mx + b&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''y'' is a variable that can take values dependant on the values for the other parameters.



== Variables ==

A variable is a storage location where we can hold values. A variable can be the size of one of our datatypes, such as a bit, a nibble, a byte, and a word. Once we define a variable, the size of it is fixed: If we define a byte, our variable cannot contain values over 255.

=== Defining a Variable ===

To define a variable, we use the VAR keyword. First we need to give a name to our variable, and the name for the variable cannot be the same as any of the reserved words. Variable names must start with a letter, may contain letters or numbers, and are not case sensitive. Here are some examples:

 MyVariable1 VAR Bit
 MyVariable2 VAR Nib
 MyVariable3 VAR Byte
 MyVariable4 VAR Word

=== Aliases ===

We can give names to the individual parts of our variables. For instance, we know that a byte is made up of 8 bits, and if we want we can give each of these bits a name, if we want. Notice that bit numbers start at 0, not 1. Here are some examples:

 MyVariable VAR Byte
 FirstBit VAR MyVariable.Bit0
 FirstNib VAR MyVariable.Nib0
 SecondNib VAR MyVariable.Nib1
 FirstBitFirstNib VAR FirstNib.Bit0

Notice that the variable &lt;code&gt;FirstBit&lt;/code&gt; is the same exact thing as &lt;code&gt;FirstNibFirstBit&lt;/code&gt;. 

=== Arrays ===

If we have multiple data values that are related, and we don't want to give them all individual names, we can create an '''array'''. An array is a large variable that contains many &quot;boxes&quot;, each with an address. The array has a name, and to access an individual box in the array, you need the name of the array and the address. Here are some examples:

 MyArray VAR Byte(10)

This creates an array with 10 bytes. Each byte can still only contain numbers up to 255, and we cannot combine multiple bytes in our array to make larger numbers.

We can use aliases with array elements too:

 MyArray VAR Byte(10)
 MyVariable VAR MyArray(0)

We can also make more complicated aliases, but we need to keep the box address at the end:

 MyArray VAR Byte(10)
 MyVariable VAR MyArray.Nib1.Bit0(0)

== Constants ==

Sometimes when we are doing calculations, we can define a thing called a '''constant''' to make things easier. Constants are just numbers, not variables, and once you set the value it cannot be changed. A common example of a constant that people use is &amp;pi; = 3.1415.... Instead of having to write out &amp;pi; to several decimal points each time we want to use it, we can simply define a constant value with the name &quot;pi&quot;. To define a constant, we use the CON keyword. Here are a few examples:

 Ten CON 10
 ACouple CON 2
 ABunch CON 1024

Constants are useful for a number of reasons:
#Makes mathematical equations easier to read.
#If we need to change a value, we only change the CON definition, and we dont need to change it everywhere in the code</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lowland Scots Lesson Two: Numbers and Greetings'''

==Number Basics==
The number system in Scots is very similar to English, which is obvious because Lowlands is English's closest relative. The numbers are as follows;
*'''wan&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  ''one''
*'''twa'''  ''two''
*'''three'''  ''three''
*'''fower'''  ''four''
*'''five'''  ''five''
*'''sax'''  ''six''
*'''seiven'''  ''seven''
*'''aicht'''  ''eight''
*'''nine'''  ''nine''
*'''ten'''  ''ten''
*'''eleiven'''  ''eleven''
*'''twal'''  ''twelve''
*'''thirteen'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  ''thirteen''
*'''fowerteen'''  ''fourteen''
*'''fifteen'''  ''fifteen''
*'''saxteen'''  ''sixteen''
*'''seiventeen'''  ''seventeen''
*'''aichteen'''  ''eighteen''
*'''nineteen'''&lt;!-- ? --&gt;  ''nineteen''
*'''twinty'''  ''twenty''

*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Also pronounced &quot;yin&quot; &quot;een&quot; or &quot;wan&quot; and &quot;ae&quot; also pronounced &quot;yae&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;thritteen&quot; or &quot;deil's dizzen&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Greetings==
Some common phrases include as follows:
*Scots: ''walcome. hous it gaun?&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; a'am daein fine.&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt; thank ye. thanks. hou much. cheerio.''
*English: ''welcome. how are you? I am well. thank you. Thanks. how much? good-bye.''


*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: It literally says &quot;how is it going?&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: It literally says &quot;I'm doing fine&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: &quot;A am&quot; would coloquially be contracted into the word &quot;A'm&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

===Dialogue===
Scots:
*John: Whit like?&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
*Mary: A'm daein fine. An yersel?&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
*John: A'm daein fine an aw. Thanks for askin! A'm awa the nou. See ye efter.&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
*Mary: See ye efter.

English:
*John: How are you?
*Mary: I'm well. You?
*John: I'm well, too. Thanks for asking! I got to go now. Bye.
*Mary: Bye.

Literal Translations:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; ''&quot;What like?&quot;'' - similar in meaning to: &quot;How's things?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; ''&quot;I'm doing fine. And yourself?&quot;''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; ''&quot;I'm doing fine and all. Thanks for asking. I'm away the now. See you after&quot;''

==End of lesson two==
Now that lesson two is complete, you'd should also be able to have a simple conversation with anybody that speaks Scots. You can even count up to &quot;twinty&quot;! In the next lesson, we will discuss more advanced number material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PBASIC/Page}}

== Control Flow ==

Computers are only able to perform one action at a time. This means that if we write up a large program with many instructions, that the BasicStamp will execute those instructions one at a time, starting at the top and moving to the bottom. The order in which the BasicStamp executes instructions is called the '''control flow'''. There are several tools that we can use to change the control flow, so that it doesnt just start at the top and move to the bottom.

=== Tokens and the Instruction Pointer ===

When we '''compile''' our program, the computer changes the code that we have written into a series of '''tokens''' that the BasicStamp can understand. This process is very complicated, so we won't discuss it any further in this book. When we upload our program to the BasicStamp, all of the tokens from the program are stored, in order, in the BasicStamp's FLASH memory unit. The tokens are stored in an array. A special address variable, called the '''instruction pointer''' points at the different elements in the token array, and whatever the instruction pointer points at is the instruction that the BasicStamp will perform at that moment.

== Labels ==

We can create special tags called '''labels''' that are like addresses or anchors. If we create a label in our code, we can '''jump''' to it from other parts of our program by using special instructions called GOTO, GOSUB, or branches called IF / THEN. Labels must have a name, just like a variable. They must:
*Start with a letter
*Contain letters or numbers
*End with a colon &quot;:&quot;

== GOTO ==

The most simple way to jump to a label that we have defined is through the use of the GOTO command. The GOTO command causes the instruction pointer to point at the label, instead of the next instruction.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

With Snatchers surrounding the camp, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] quickly jinxes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s face to hide his identity. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Hermione are forced out of the tent and bound with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], who have also been captured. Assuming that the Trio are students on the run, the Snatchers check a wanted list. Hermione claims she is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]], a half-blood. Ron identifies himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], but the Snatchers know this is untrue, and Ron then claims he is a Weasley relative. Harry identifies himself as Vernon Dudley, a Slytherin student, and accurately describes the Slytherin Common room: he and Ron (using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to impersonate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]) were there during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 12|their second year at Hogwarts]]. However, the Snatchers recognize Hermione's photo in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] and find Harry's glasses. The scar beneath his puffy, jinxed forehead is barely discernible, leaving them unsure. They also find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]].

Harry, meanwhile, has slipped back into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s mind and sees a black fortress with a tall tower within; an ancient man says he was expecting Voldemort, but tells him that he never had it.

Believing he has captured &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot;, the Snatchers' leader, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], takes the captives to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord's]] headquarters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] believes Voldemort will forgive him when he turns over Harry Potter, but he first orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to verify Harry's identity. Draco, fearful and hesitant, claims to be unsure. Draco's mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], notices that Harry's wand does not match [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]]'s description, and wants to be positive it is him before summoning Voldemort. Narcissa recognizes Hermione from Madam Malkin's robe shop and also her picture in the ''Daily Prophet''. Lucius prods Draco to identify Ron and Hermione, and he reluctantly admits it could be them.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] enters and is also uncertain if it's Harry, but wants to inform Voldemort immediately, though Lucius claims it is his right to do so. Greyback interjects, saying he captured Potter and demands the reward; he also wants Hermione as a prize. As Lucius is about to touch his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] to Summon Lord Voldemort, Bellatrix shrieks: a Snatcher has Gryffindor's Sword. When he is reluctant to hand it over, Bellatrix [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] all the Snatchers except Greyback, who is now on his knees. Bellatrix screams that they are all in peril if her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] vault has been breached.

Harry, Ron, Dean and Griphook are taken to the cellar, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] and Ollivander are also imprisoned, while Hermione is left upstairs to be interrogated. Bellatrix [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|tortures her]] to learn if the Sword was stolen from the Lestrange's vault; Ron, hearing Hermione's screams of pain, becomes distraught. With Luna's help and light from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]], Harry, Ron, Dean, and Griphook are unbound, though Griphook is badly injured.

Searching his pouch, Harry sees a blue flash in the mirror shard, and frantically begs for help. Upstairs, Hermione, despite being tortured, tells Bellatrix the Sword is a fake. Lucius Malfoy sends Draco to fetch Griphook so he can verify this, and Harry quickly tells Griphook to claim the Sword is fake. After Draco collects Griphook, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] into the cellar and confirms he can Disapparate with humans.

Again, Harry peers through Voldemort's eyes, seeing the old man telling Voldemort that killing him will bring him no nearer to what he seeks.

Dobby Apparates Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s home. When the loud cracking Disapparition noise brings [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] to the cellar to investigate, Harry and Ron attack him. Wormtail grabs Harry, choking him with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 33|silver hand]]. Harry reminds Wormtail that he is owed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 19|life debt]]. Hesitating, Wormtail momentarily relaxes his grip, and the silver hand turns on him, fatally strangling its owner.

Ron and Harry rush upstairs, armed only with Wormtail's wand. Griphook has declared the Gryffindor Sword is a fake. Bellatrix, satisfied her vault is safe, summons Voldemort, then offers Hermione to Greyback as a reward. Harry's scar explodes with pain as he sees Voldemort, angry at being summoned, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing]] the old man. Ron bursts into the room and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Bellatrix with Wormtail's wand while Harry, who runs in after him, catches it and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Lucius Malfoy. Bellatrix, pressing a silver knife to Hermione's neck, orders them to drop the wands; Draco collects them. Dobby suddenly reappears, dropping the crystal chandelier on Bellatrix, Hermione, and Griphook, and disarming Narcissa. As Ron pulls Hermione out from under the chandelier, Harry grabs all three wands from Draco and Stuns Greyback. When Bellatrix addresses Dobby as an enslaved [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]], Dobby declares he is free and has come to save Harry Potter and his friends. Harry tosses a wand to Ron, and tells him to go. Harry, Griphook and Dobby also Disapparate to safety, but Bellatrix's silver knife has seriously wounded Dobby. Cradled in Harry's arms, Dobby whispers, &quot;Harry&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Potter&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&quot; and dies.

== Analysis ==

Several characters show personality traits that have only been glimpsed previously. Ron's feelings for Hermione are further developed as he listens to Bellatrix torturing her, and when he fiercely tries to prevent her falling prey to Fenrir Greyback's perverted desires. This marks yet another turning point in Ron's maturity as he faces the possibility of losing someone he cares deeply about, and must act to save her, regardless of his own safety. Harry also shows faith in the unknown again by trusting that the blue eye in the mirror is someone who has been watching over him and will send help. Harry's trust has been somewhat affected by the eye resembling Dumbledore, though Harry still doubts his late mentor's motives. Harry's faith is rewarded, however, when Dobby appears, though it is still unknown who sent him or why.

The character dynamics are a little different at Malfoy Manor, and readers have seen how Voldemort demands absolute fidelity and obedience from his servants. Here it appears that most support him only out of fear or for personal gain, though there is certainly no guarantee that loyalty will be rewarded or lives spared. This has created conflict among his followers that is starting to undermine Voldemort's rule. Bellatrix and Lucius here vie with one another for power and favor, leaving Narcissa Malfoy the unenviable task of choosing between supporting her sister or her husband. Though unseen here, we have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|earlier evidence]] that Narcissa's devotion is only to her husband and son. Fenrir Greyback, meanwhile, desires material compensation (which includes Hermione), while the cowardly Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew) sought out the Dark Lord only for protection against the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], who would likely execute him for betraying the Potters and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Wormtail was also burdened by his life debt to Harry, an obligation he had no choice but to fulfill, and which Voldemort fatally punished him for when he did. Voldemort may have been unaware that Wormtail owed this life debt when he crafted the silver hand; it is almost certain that Wormtail would never willingly have divulged this information to Voldemort, though Pettigrew's weak mind would be far too easy for the Dark Lord to penetrate and read his thoughts; however, knowing how meek and untrustworthy Wormtail was, it is likely that Voldemort created the silver appendage as a convenient mechanism to retaliate against any disloyalty or disobedience, however slight, and, finally, to eliminate a relatively useless minion when he was no longer needed.

Draco Malfoy, meanwhile, clearly shows that he is ''not'' his father's son; when Draco is again forced into a difficult situation, he is torn between intrinsic compassion, family loyalty, and fearing Voldemort. Although he obviously recognizes Harry and the others imprisoned at Malfoy Manor, as with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] on the Astronomy Tower (in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]), and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] that Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|forced him to torture]], he resists taking any action that will endanger another. Only under his family's pressure and knowing he will be unable to lie convincingly does he admit that Harry's two companions ''could'' be Ron and Hermione. It seems unlikely that Draco has any fonder feelings for Harry and the others than he ever did and is still an obnoxious bully, but he is neither vicious nor a killer. Like Harry's cousin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]], there is an invisible line his innate humanity prevents him from ever crossing. Despite being raised with &quot;pure-blood&quot; rhetoric and elitist conditioning, Draco is mostly a half-hearted Voldemort follower, foolishly trailing along out of family duty, for adventure, and the prestige he believes it bestows. Like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], he soon finds himself in over his head, lacking the inherent evil nature to be a true Death Eater. His refusal to harm Harry and Dumbledore goes against everything he has been taught. By now, Draco probably realizes that Voldemort is only using him to punish his family and will likely kill him and his parents once they are no longer useful. Ultimately, Draco shows strength and morality by protecting the Trio, even though betraying them could help win back Voldemort's favor for his family. Consequently, Draco fails to realize that his compassion makes him a far better person than his flawed, reprehensible father; instead, he believes himself a cowardly failure. A very different Draco might have been seen here, however, had he succumbed to fatally cursing Dumbledore that fateful night on the Astronomy Tower, his soul indelibly stained by murder.

Dobby's role is also examined here. In his last act, Dobby dies a martyr and a true hero. He defies the humans who had enslaved him and breaks the promise he made to Harry during his second year never to try and save his life again. Breaking this promise comes exactly when Harry is in mortal peril and when only an Elf's unique magical abilities can save him. Dobby's life has revolved around the hope that Harry would improve other House-elves' situations by defeating Voldemort, and his admiration is clearly reflected by his dying words. Far from the fearful, cowering slave Harry first met in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', his noble, grand courage is climaxed by his daring rescue, but perhaps most importantly, he dies a free elf, which Harry will note on his tombstone. 

Although the unfortunate experience at Malfoy Manor has resulted in Dobby's tragic death, Dean, Griphook, Luna, and Ollivander are rescued from an uncertain, but likely deadly, fate. Also, Bellatrix Lestrange's frantic behavior about her vault may signal something that the Trio will need to know.

One point perhaps worth mentioning is that once again the difference between House-elf Apparition and human Apparition is seen. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 1|the first chapter]], Death Eaters Apparate just outside Malfoy Manor's gates and then proceed on foot; similarly, the Snatchers Apparate to just outside the same gates and proceed on foot once admitted. This is a clear indication that Apparition has been barred inside the Manor grounds. Yet Dobby Apparates in and out. It is curious, perhaps, that Harry and Ron, once they have defeated Bellatrix, are able to Apparate out of the manor; though the spells around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]] apparently prevented Apparition in either direction, perhaps Voldemort or Lucius worked a more advanced version of that spell, so it is only Apparition into the manor which is prohibited. Or perhaps it is a matter of timing: Voldemort is unlikely to want to Apparate to a location outside the protection of Malfoy Manor, so he might have arranged the spell preventing Apparition so that he could disable it, allowing himself to Apparate when he chose. As he has just Disapparated to return to Malfoy Manor, it is possible that he temporarily disabled the anti-Apparition spells to allow himself entry, and that provided a loophole which Harry and Ron were able to utilize.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In discussing Draco Malfoy's humanity, it should be noted that Dumbledore had also recognized this trait in him. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|As we will find out shortly]], by the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Dumbledore knew that Voldemort had tasked Draco with murdering him. This was why Dumbledore extracted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]] promise, that, if necessary, Snape would kill Dumbledore: primarily to save Draco's soul from that first, destructive act that would cost him that humanity and irretrievably push him to the Dark side. Dumbledore was also aware that Draco would likely fail in his mission, likely resulting in his execution, and suspected that another Death Eater would complete the job. Snape would allow Dumbledore to die with dignity and by his own design, whereas other Death Eaters would not. 

Draco is not entirely redeemed, however, and in a later chapter, he will attempt to capture Harry for Voldemort, though he may be motivated by trying to reprieve his family from the Dark Lord's wrath. In this light, it is important to compare Draco's behaviour here, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|later in the story]], when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are searching for something in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], and Draco, with his sidekicks Crabbe and Goyle, tries to intervene and capture Harry for the Dark Lord. We will see that back at Hogwarts, away from his family's influence and with his minions in tow, Draco once more reverts to his previous, bullying self. This will be short-lived, as Draco once again falls apart when he is separated from his followers. This is typical bully behaviour, particularly one like Draco who has learned his techniques from one of his parents. Without his &quot;gang's&quot; support, Draco is cowardly. Even with his cronies, whenever things deviate from his internal script, he has little recourse except to run away — note his reaction when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 15|Hermione slapped him]] in an earlier year.

Harry, witnessing Bellatrix's near-panic when the Sword of Gryffindor is discovered, and remembering Griphook's earlier words that the replica Sword of Gryffindor was moved from the Headmaster's office to a Gringotts vault, will correctly guess that it is the Lestrange vault where the fake Sword is secured, and that there is another object stored there that Voldemort highly values. Harry will correctly surmise that this is another [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], and that it is Hufflepuff's Cup, that being the only Founders' artifact that was mentioned or seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey's]] memory, but not examined.

The reader likely recognizes the high tower that Voldemort is inspecting as Nurmengard, and may have guessed that the old man who Voldemort is interrogating is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. This constitutes, in Voldemort's mind, the penultimate link in the chain that he is following towards the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]]. He will learn that Grindelwald had lost the wand to Dumbledore, and will guess that Dumbledore had the wand interred with him. Very shortly, Harry, who will have reached the same conclusion, will have to decide whether he will race Voldemort to Hogwarts for that wand, or whether he will continue to chase Horcruxes. It will be mentioned later that event timing in this chapter is somewhat critical; Harry must be distracted enough that he withdraws from Voldemort's mind just as Voldemort is examining Grindelwald's memories. If Harry perceives the battle between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, tinged as it is bound to be by the memories of their friendship (and possibly more than friendship), &lt;!-- Glad you added the &quot;possibly more than friendship&quot; comment! It is entirely appropriate to acknowledge it in this way. -Raven --&gt; the turmoil in Harry's mind could only be increased, causing him to be less likely to make the necessary decisions to close this book satisfactorily. To this end, Hermione's torture and Harry's fight with Pettigrew are necessary to this final book's plot.

In light of what happens in future chapters, we should note the various wands that are changing hands in this chapter. Harry's own damaged wand remains, of course, hidden and useless in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Moke|Moke-skin]] bag. The short blackthorn wand Harry was using, Ron's wand, and Hermione's wand are all captured by the Snatchers, and while we see the blackthorn wand again, its role in the upcoming battle is insignificant. Ron captures Pettigrew's wand and uses it to disarm Bellatrix; Harry uses Bellatrix' wand to Stun Lucius Malfoy, who still lacks a wand, having surrendered his to Voldemort. Bellatrix forces Harry and Ron to drop their wands, and Draco collects them. After the chandelier falls, Harry recovers Bellatrix' and Pettigrew's wands from Draco, as well as claiming Draco's, Stuns Fenrir and tosses one wand to Ron. Narcissa attempts to jinx Harry but is disarmed by Dobby. The other Snatchers are excluded from the matter, as Bellatrix had previously Stunned everyone when her demand for the Sword of Gryffindor was resisted. So as they leave Malfoy Manor, they take Pettigrew's, Draco's, and Bellatrix' captured wands, leaving Hermione's, Ron's, and the blackthorn one Harry had been so annoyed by. Harry will guess, without much support, that the Death Eaters will interrogate Hermione's wand and determine that it had broken Harry's wand, the one that Voldemort so feared. We will see no evidence, however, that this has actually occurred, or that a wand can be interrogated with such high precision after so lengthy a time and many intervening spells.</text>

== Hmmm, bummer! ==

I guess you're trying to talk with the authors of the [[Ecology]] book? Unfortunately the early authors haven't been around for a while. I know quite a bit about the subject (and wikibooks), so if you have any questions or need someone to bounce ideas off of, feel free to ask me! --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:46, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

== Page Counting ==

Hello Paul, I saw your message in staff lounge. I have written a javascript that can count all sorts of things about a page, including the number of characters, words, etc. If you tell me what pages you want counted I can do it for you and post you the results. Also, if you would like to do it for yourself, I can install the script on your user account javascript page (at [[User:PaulWLepp/monobook.js]]) and you could use it yourself. Let me know what you would prefer. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:17, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

:I have installed the script for you. What browser are you using? I have tested it in IE and FireFox, but I have not tested it to work in Opera or Safari. If you need compatibility with either of these other browsers, let me know and I can test it/fix it as needed. To ensure that the script is loaded, do a hard page reset. In IE or FireFox, you can press CTRL + F5 to do a hard reset. 
:To use the script, go to [[User:Whiteknight/Tester Gadget]]. You should see a small textbox there and two buttons, &quot;get&quot; and &quot;clear&quot;. Type the title of the page you want to check into the box and click &quot;Get&quot;. The page will be analyzed, and the results will be displayed. Clicking &quot;Clear&quot; will clear the results.
:Please let me know if it works, and if there are any other options or features that you think I could add to future versions of it. If it does not work, let me know what happens, what browser you are using, etc, and I will try to help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:40, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== [[Introduction to Bioinformatics]] ==

There is an outline that you can work with or adjust and some initial content at [[Bioinformatics]]. That book has been abandoned, so you could refactor it and also gain the benefit of the one-word title. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:03, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

:We encourage continued improvement upon existing texts.  If you don't care for a page, you can mark it with {{tlx|delete|your reason}}.  If you decide to adopt the book, please let me know and I'll remove [[Introduction to Bioinformatics]] to avoid confusion.

== Ruby Data Types ==

As mentioned in the previous chapter, everything in Ruby is an object. Everything has a class. Don't believe me? Try running this bit of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
h = {&quot;hash?&quot; =&gt; &quot;yep, it\'s a hash!&quot;, &quot;the answer to everything&quot; =&gt; 42, :linux =&gt; &quot;fun for coders.&quot;}
puts &quot;Stringy string McString!&quot;.class
puts 1.class
puts nil.class
puts h.class
puts :symbol.class
&lt;/source&gt;
displays
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
String
Fixnum
NilClass
Hash
Symbol
&lt;/source&gt;


See? Everything is an object. Every object has a method called &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; that returns that object's class. You can call methods on pretty much anything. Earlier you saw an example of this in the form of &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;3.times&lt;/source&gt;. (Technically when you call a method you're sending a message to the object, but I'll leave the significance of that for later.)&lt;br&gt;
Something that makes this extreme object oriented-ness very fun for me is the fact that all classes are open, meaning you can add variables and methods to a class at any time during the execution of your code. This, however, is a discussion of datatypes.

== Constants ==
We'll start off with constants because they're simple. Two things to remember about constants:&lt;br&gt;
1. Constants start with capital letters. &lt;tt&gt;Constant&lt;/tt&gt; is a constant. &lt;tt&gt;constant&lt;/tt&gt; is not a constant.&lt;br&gt;
2. You can change the values of constants, but Ruby will give you a warning. (Silly, I know... but what can you do?)&lt;br&gt;
Congrats. Now you're an expert on Ruby constants.

== Symbols ==
So did you notice something weird about that first code listing? &quot;What the heck was that colon thingy about?&quot;
Well, it just so happens that Ruby's object oriented ways have a cost: lots of objects make for slow code. Every time you type a string, Ruby makes a new object. Regardless of whether two strings are identical, Ruby treats every instance as a new object. You could have &quot;live long and prosper&quot; in your code once and then again later on and Ruby wouldn't even realize that they're pretty much the same thing. Here is a sample irb session which demonstrates this fact:

&lt;tt&gt;irb&gt; &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&quot;live long and prosper&quot;.object_id&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&gt; -507772268&lt;br&gt;
irb&gt; &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&quot;live long and prosper&quot;.object_id&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&gt; -507776538&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Notice that the object ID returned by irb Ruby is different even for the same two strings.

To get around this memory hoggishness, Ruby has provided &quot;symbols.&quot; &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Symbol&lt;/source&gt;s are lightweight objects best used for comparisons and internal logic. If the user doesn't ever see it, why not use a symbol rather than a string? Your code will thank you for it. Let us try running the above code using symbols instead of strings:

&lt;tt&gt;irb&gt; &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;:my_symbol.object_id&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&gt; 150808&lt;br&gt;
irb&gt; &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;:my_symbol.object_id&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&gt; 150808&lt;br&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

Symbols are denoted by the colon sitting out in front of them, like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;:symbol_name&lt;/source&gt;

== Hashes ==
Hashes are like dictionaries, in a sense. You have a key, a reference, and you look it up to find the associated object, the definition. 

The best way to illustrate this, I think, is with a quick demonstration:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
hash = { :leia =&gt; &quot;Princess from Alderaan&quot;, :han =&gt; &quot;Rebel without a cause&quot;, :luke =&gt; &quot;Farmboy turned Jedi&quot;}
puts hash[:leia]
puts hash[:han]
puts hash[:luke]
&lt;/source&gt;
displays
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Princess from Alderaan
Rebel without a cause
Farmboy turned Jedi
&lt;/source&gt;

I could have also written this like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
hash = { :leia =&gt; &quot;Princess from Alderaan&quot;, :han =&gt; &quot;Rebel without a cause&quot;, :luke =&gt; &quot;Farmboy turned Jedi&quot;}
hash.each do |key, value|
     puts value
end
&lt;/source&gt;
This code cycles through each element in the hash, putting the key in the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;key&lt;/source&gt; variable and the value in the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;value&lt;/source&gt; variable, which is then displayed
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Princess of Alderaan
Rebel without a cause
Farmboy turned Jedi
&lt;/source&gt;

I could have been more verbose about defining my hash; I could have written it like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
hash = Hash.[](:leia =&gt; &quot;Princess from Alderaan&quot;, :han =&gt; &quot;Rebel without a cause&quot;, :luke =&gt; &quot;Farmboy turned Jedi&quot;)
hash.each do |key, value|
     puts value
end
&lt;/source&gt;

If I felt like offing Luke, I could do something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
hash.delete(:luke)
&lt;/source&gt;
Now Luke's no longer in the hash.
Or lets say I just had a vendetta against farmboys in general. I could do this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
hash.delete_if {|key, value| value.downcase.match(&quot;farmboy&quot;)}
&lt;/source&gt;
This iterates through each key-value pair and deletes it, but only if the block of code following it returns &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;true&lt;/source&gt;. In the block I made the value lowercase (in case the farmboys decided to start doing stuff like &quot;FaRmBoY!1!&quot;) and then checked to see if &quot;farmboy&quot; matched anything in its contents. I could have used a regular expression, but that's another story entirely.

I could add Lando into the mix by assigning a new value to the hash:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
hash[:lando] = &quot;Dashing and debonair city administrator.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

I can measure the hash with &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;hash.length&lt;/source&gt;. I can look at only keys with the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;hash.inspect&lt;/source&gt; method, which returns the hash's keys as an &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;. Speaking of which...

== Arrays ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;s are a lot like &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Hash&lt;/source&gt;es, except that the keys are always consecutive numbers, and always starts at 0. In an &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt; with five items, the ''last'' element would be found at &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array[4]&lt;/source&gt; and the ''first'' element would be found at &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array[0]&lt;/source&gt;. In addition, all the methods that you just learned with &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Hash&lt;/source&gt;es can also be applied to &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;s.

Here are two ways to create an &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
array1 = [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;array!&quot;]
array2 = []
array2 &lt;&lt; &quot;This&quot;   # index 0
array2 &lt;&lt; &quot;is&quot;     # index 1
array2 &lt;&lt; &quot;also&quot;   # index 2
array2 &lt;&lt; &quot;an&quot;     # index 3
array2 &lt;&lt; &quot;array!&quot; # index 4
&lt;/source&gt;
As you may have guessed, the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/source&gt; operator pushes values onto the end of an &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;. If I were to write &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;puts array2[4]&lt;/source&gt; after declaring those two &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;s the output would be &lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array!&lt;/source&gt;. Of course, if I felt like simultaneously getting &lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array!&lt;/source&gt; and deleting it from the array, I could just &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array.pop&lt;/source&gt; it off. The &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array.pop&lt;/source&gt; method returns the ''last'' element in an array and then immediately removes it from that array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
string = array2.pop
&lt;/source&gt;
Then &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string&lt;/source&gt; would hold &lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array!&lt;/source&gt; and &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array2&lt;/source&gt; would be an element shorter.&lt;br&gt;
If I kept doing this, array2 wouldn't hold any elements. I can check for this condition by calling the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array.empty?&lt;/source&gt; method. For example, the following bit of code moves all the elements from one &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt; to another:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
array1 &lt;&lt; array2.pop until array2.empty?
&lt;/source&gt;
Here's something that really excites me: &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt;s can be subtracted from, and added to, each other. I can't vouch for ''every'' language that's out there, but I know that Java, C++, C# and perl would all look at me like I was a crazy person if I tried to execute the following bit of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
array3 = array1 - array2
array4 = array1 + array2
&lt;/source&gt;

After that code is evaluated, all of the following are true:
* &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array3&lt;/source&gt; contains all of the elements that &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array1&lt;/source&gt; did, except the ones that were also in &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array2&lt;/source&gt;. 
* All the elements of &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array1&lt;/source&gt;, minus the elements of &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array2&lt;/source&gt;, are now contained within &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array3&lt;/source&gt;. 
* &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array4&lt;/source&gt; now contains all the elements of both &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array1&lt;/source&gt; and &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array2&lt;/source&gt;.

You may search for a particular value in variable &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array1&lt;/source&gt; with the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array.include?&lt;/source&gt; method: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;array1.include?(&quot;Is this in here?&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

If you just wanted to turn the whole &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/source&gt; into a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt;, you could:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;string = array2.join(&quot; &quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
If array2 had the value that we  declared in the last example, then &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string&lt;/source&gt;'s value would be 
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;This is also an array!&lt;/source&gt; 

We could have called the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Array.join&lt;/source&gt; method without any arguments:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;string = array2.join&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string&lt;/source&gt;'s value would now be
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Thisisalsoanarray!&lt;/source&gt;

== Strings ==
I would recommend reading the chapters on [[Ruby_Programming/Strings|strings]] and [[Ruby_Programming/Alternate quotes|alternate quotes]] now if you haven't already. This chapter is going to cover some pretty spiffy things with &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt;s and just assume that you already know the information in these two chapters.

In Ruby, there are some pretty cool built-in functions where &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt;s are concerned. For example, you can multiply them:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot; * 5&lt;/source&gt; 
yields 
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Danger, Will Robinson!Danger, Will Robinson!Danger, Will Robinson!Danger, Will Robinson!Danger, Will Robinson!&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt;s may also be compared:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;&lt;/source&gt; 
yields 
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;true&lt;/source&gt;

The preceding evaluation is actually comparing the ASCII values of the characters. But what, I hear you ask, is the ASCII value of an given character?
With ruby versions prior to 1.9 you can find the ASCII value of a character with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;puts ?A&lt;/source&gt;
However, With Ruby version 1.9 or later [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1270209/getting-an-ascii-character-code-in-ruby-fails that no longer works]. Instead, you can try the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String.ord&lt;/source&gt; method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;puts &quot;A&quot;.ord&lt;/source&gt;
Either approach will display
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;65&lt;/source&gt;
which is the ASCII value of &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;. Simply replace &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; with whichever character you wish to inquire about.

To perform the opposite conversion (from &lt;tt&gt;65&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, for instance), use the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Integer.chr&lt;/source&gt; method: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;puts 65.chr&lt;/source&gt; 
displays 
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/source&gt;

Concatenation works the same as most other languages: putting a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;+&lt;/source&gt; character between two &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt;s will yield a new &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; whose value is the same as the others, one after another:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;&quot;Hi, this is &quot; + &quot;a concatenated string!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
yields
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Hi, this is a concatenated string!&lt;/source&gt;

For handling pesky &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; variables without using the concatenate operator, you can use interpolation. In the following chunk of code &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string1&lt;/source&gt;, &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string2&lt;/source&gt;, and &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string3&lt;/source&gt; are identical:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
thing1 = &quot;Red fish, &quot;
thing2 = &quot;blue fish.&quot;
string1 = thing1 + thing2 + &quot; And so on and so forth.&quot;
string2 = &quot;#{thing1 + thing2} And so on and so forth.&quot;
string3 = &quot;#{thing1}#{thing2} And so on and so forth.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you need to iterate through (that is, step through each of) the letters in a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; object, you can use the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String.scan&lt;/source&gt; method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
thing = &quot;Red fish&quot;
thing.scan(/./) {|letter| puts letter}
&lt;/source&gt;
Displays each letter in &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/source&gt; (puts automatically adds a newline after each call):
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
R
e
d
 
f
i
s
h
&lt;/source&gt;
But what's with that weird &quot;&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;/./&lt;/source&gt;&quot; thing in the parameter? That, my friend, is called a [[Ruby_Programming/Reference/Objects/Regexp|''regular expression'']]. They're helpful little buggers, quite powerful, but outside the scope of this discussion. All you need to know for now is that &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;/./&lt;/source&gt; is &quot;regex&quot; speak for &quot;any ''one'' character.&quot; If we had used &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;/../&lt;/source&gt; then ruby would have iterated over each group of two characters, and missed the last one since there's an odd number of characters!

Another use for regular expressions can be found with the &lt;tt&gt;=~&lt;/tt&gt; operator. You can check to see if a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; matches a regular expression using the match ''operator'', &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;=~&lt;/source&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
puts &quot;Yeah, there's a number in this one.&quot; if &quot;C3-P0, human-cyborg relations&quot; =~ /[0-9]/
&lt;/source&gt;
displays
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Yeah, there's a number in this one.&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String.match&lt;/source&gt; method works much the same way, except it can accept a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; as a parameter as well. This is helpful if you're getting regular expressions from a source outside the code. Here's what it looks like in action:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
puts &quot;Yep, they mentioned Jabba in this one.&quot; if &quot;Jabba the Hutt&quot;.match(&quot;Jabba&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Alright, that's enough about regular expressions. Even though you can use regular expressions with the next two examples, we'll just use regular old &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt;s. Lets pretend you work at the Ministry of Truth and you need to replace a word in a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; with another word. You can try something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
string1 = &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;
string2 = string1.sub(&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Now &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;string2&lt;/source&gt; contains &lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;2 + 2 = 5&lt;/source&gt;. But what if the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; contains lots of lies like the one you just corrected? &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String.sub&lt;/source&gt; only replaces the first occurrence of a word! I guess you could iterate through the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; using &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String.match&lt;/source&gt; method and a &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;while&lt;/source&gt; loop, but there's a much more efficient way to accomplish this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
winston = %q{   Down with Big Brother!
		Down with Big Brother!
		Down with Big Brother!
		Down with Big Brother!
		Down with Big Brother!}
winston.gsub(&quot;Down with&quot;, &quot;Long live&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Big Brother would be ''so'' proud! &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String.gsub&lt;/source&gt; is the &quot;''g''lobal ''sub''stitute&quot; function. Every occurrence of &quot;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Down with&lt;/source&gt;&quot; has now been replaced with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Long live&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; so now &lt;tt&gt;winston&lt;/tt&gt; is only proclaiming its love for Big Brother, not its disdain thereof.&lt;br&gt;
On that happy note, lets move on to &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/source&gt;s and &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Float&lt;/source&gt;s. If you want to learn more about methods in the &lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;String&lt;/source&gt; class, look at the end of this chapter for a quick reference table.

== Numbers (Integers and Floats) ==
You can skip this paragraph if you know all the standard number operators. For those who don't, here's a crash course. &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; adds two numbers together. &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; subtracts them. &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; divides. &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; multiplies. &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; returns the remainder of two divided numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alright, integers are numbers with no decimal place. Floats are numbers with decimal places. &lt;tt&gt;10 / 3&lt;/tt&gt; yields &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; because dividing two integers yields an integer. Since integers have no decimal places all you get is &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;. If you tried &lt;tt&gt;10.0 / 3&lt;/tt&gt; you would get &lt;tt&gt;3.33333...&lt;/tt&gt; If you have even one float in the mix you get a float back. Capice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alright, let's get down to the fun part. Everything in Ruby is an object, let me reiterate. That means that pretty much everything has at least one method. Integers and floats are no exception. First I'll show you some integer methods.&lt;br&gt;
Here we have the venerable &lt;tt&gt;times&lt;/tt&gt; method. Use it whenever you want to do something more than once. Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;I will now count to 99...&quot;
100.times {|number| puts number}
5.times {puts &quot;Guess what?&quot;}
puts &quot;I'm done!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
This will print out the numbers 0 through 99, print out &lt;tt&gt;Guess what?&lt;/tt&gt; five times, then say &lt;tt&gt;I'm done!&lt;/tt&gt; It's basically a simplified &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop. It's a little slower than a &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop by a few hundredths of a second or so; keep that in mind if you're ever writing Ruby code for NASA. ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alright, we're nearly done, six more methods to go. Here are three of them:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# First a visit from The Count...
1.upto(10) {|number| puts &quot;#{number} Ruby loops, ah-ah-ah!&quot;}

# Then a quick stop at NASA...
puts &quot;T-minus...&quot;
10.downto(1) {|x| puts x}
puts &quot;Blast-off!&quot;

# Finally we'll settle down with an obscure Schoolhouse Rock video...
5.step(50, 5) {|x| puts x}
&lt;/source&gt;
Alright, that should make sense. In case it didn't, &lt;tt&gt;upto&lt;/tt&gt; counts up from the number it's called from to the number passed in its parameter. &lt;tt&gt;downto&lt;/tt&gt; does the same, except it counts down instead of up. Finally, &lt;tt&gt;step&lt;/tt&gt; counts from the number its called from to the first number in its parameters by the second number in its parameters. So &lt;tt&gt;5.step(25, 5) {|x| puts x}&lt;/tt&gt; would output every multiple of five starting with five and ending at twenty-five.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Time for the last three:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
string1 = 451.to_s
string2 = 98.6.to_s
int = 4.5.to_i
float = 5.to_f
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;to_s&lt;/tt&gt; converts floats and integers to strings. &lt;tt&gt;to_i&lt;/tt&gt; converts floats to integers. &lt;tt&gt;to_f&lt;/tt&gt; converts integers to floats. There you have it. All the data types of Ruby in a nutshell. Now here's that quick reference table for string methods I promised you.

== Additional String Methods ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# Outputs 1585761545
&quot;Mary J&quot;.hash

# Outputs &quot;concatenate&quot;
&quot;concat&quot; + &quot;enate&quot;

# Outputs &quot;Washington&quot;
&quot;washington&quot;.capitalize

# Outputs &quot;uppercase&quot;
&quot;UPPERCASE&quot;.downcase

# Outputs &quot;LOWERCASE&quot;
&quot;lowercase&quot;.upcase

# Outputs &quot;Henry VII&quot;
&quot;Henry VIII&quot;.chop

# Outputs &quot;rorriM&quot;
&quot;Mirror&quot;.reverse

# Outputs 810
&quot;All Fears&quot;.sum

# Outputs cRaZyWaTeRs
&quot;CrAzYwAtErS&quot;.swapcase

# Outputs &quot;Nexu&quot; (next advances the word up one value, as if it were a number.)
&quot;Next&quot;.next

# After this, nxt == &quot;Neyn&quot; (to help you understand the trippiness of next)
nxt = &quot;Next&quot;
20.times {nxt = nxt.next}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Runtime Static Initialization Order Idioms&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Control the order of initialization and destruction of non-local static objects across compilation units that are otherwise ordered in an implementation dependent manner.

=== Motivation ===
* Order of initialization of static objects spread across different compilation units is not well defined. Order of destruction is the reverse of initialization order but initialization order itself is implementation defined. Bring order to this chaos.
* The destructor of static objects are non-trivial and have important side-effects that have to happen

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The following idioms are commonly used to control the order of initialization of static objects.

* [[More C%2B%2B Idioms/Nifty Counter | Nifty Counter Idiom (a.k.a. Schwarz Counter Idiom)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Construct On First Use&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Ensure that an object is initialized before its first use. Specifically, ensure that non-local static object is initialized before its first use.

=== Also Known As ===
Lazy construction/evaluation

=== Motivation ===
Static objects that have non-trivial constructors must be initialized before they are used. It is possible to access an uninitialized non-local static object before its initialization if proper care is not exercised.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct Bar {
  Bar () {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bar::Bar()\n&quot;;
  }
  void f () {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bar::f()\n&quot;;
  }
};
struct Foo {
  Foo () {
    bar_.f ();
  }
  static Bar bar_;
};

Foo f;
Bar Foo::bar_;

int main () {}
&lt;/source&gt;
In the above code, Bar::f() gets called before its constructor. It should be avoided.
=== Solution and Sample Code ===
There are 2 possible solutions, which depends upon whether the destructor of the object in consideration has non-trivial destruction semantics. Wrap the otherwise static object in a function so that function initializes it before it is used.

* '''Construct on first use using dynamic allocation'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct Foo {
  Foo () {
    bar().f ();
  }
 Bar &amp; bar () {
    static Bar *b = new Bar ();
    return *b;
 }
};
&lt;/source&gt;
If the object has a destructor with non-trivial semantics, local static object is used instead of dynamic allocation as given below.

* '''Construct on first use using local static'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct Foo {
  Foo () {
    bar().f ();
  }
 Bar &amp; bar () {
    static Bar b;
    return b;
 }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Known Uses ===
* Singleton pattern implementations often use this idiom.
* ACE_TSS&lt;T&gt; class template in Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE) for creating and accessing objects in thread specific storage (TSS) uses this idiom.

=== Related Idioms ===
* [[More C%2B%2B Idioms/Nifty Counter|Nifty/Schwarz Counter]]

Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the help desk.

Dear Nickyudichak,

Welcome to Wikibooks!

Is Lo Langesi is a relatively static, slowly-changing language, encumbered by years of literature, like [[French]]?
Then please give us a reference to that literature.
Wikibooks is a great place for such languages.

Or is Lo Langesi is a dynamic, rapidly-changing language, free from compatibility barnacles?
The Conlang Wikia ( http://conlang.wikia.com/ ) is a great place for such languages.

Even though each one of the over 4375 wiki online has a pretty narrow focus, I suspect there is nothing that anyone could think up that wouldn't be on-topic at some wiki.

{{recipesummary|Casserole recipes|6|prep ½ hour&lt;br&gt;total 45 minutes|2}}

==The Chili==

===Ingredients===

* 4 strips [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], cut in small pieces
* 1½ [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coffee|instant coffee]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]] (canned)
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburger]]
* 1 pound [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 can (15-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]]) diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]

===Procedure===

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|425°F]].
# Dice onion and cut beef into small pieces.
# [[Cookbook:Fry|Fry]] bacon at medium-high heat in big [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]].
# Lower heat to medium and put in brown sugar, chili powder, coffee, cumin, jalapeños, oregano, and paprika. 
# Cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
# Add onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
# Add beef pieces and hamburger and cook until lightly done, maybe 8 or 10 minutes.
# While beef is cooking, start on cornbread.
# Add tomatoes to skillet and cook 1 minute, stirring deeply to keep anything from sticking to the bottom.

==The cornbread==

===Ingredients===

* 2 tablespoons (¼ stick) butter
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|corn meal]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

===Procedure===

# Melt, then cool butter.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] butter, egg, and milk together.
# Combine corn meal, flour, and salt, then add baking powder and baking soda.
# Stir in liquid mixture (butter, egg, and milk).
# Set aside and go back to chili recipe above.

==The Casserole==

===Ingredients===

* Chili mix
* Cornbread mix

===Procedure===

# Spray a 9x12 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|baking pan]] with [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking spray]].
# Put entire chili recipe in baking pan and smooth surface.
# Spoon cornbread mixture over chili mixture and smooth with a large spoon.
# [[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] about 20 minutes, or until cornbread pulls away from the sides of the pan.
# Serve in bowls, making sure every large spoonful has both textures.

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===

* Beans in the chili would probably be too much starch.
* Finish seasoning the chili before assembling with cornbread.

= Motivation =
You would like to be able to select all rows in a table using a single trigger.

= Approach =
You can put a list of items in a table and have a single column that has a checkbox in it.  You can then use the index function to change the selected item.

               &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;@selected&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Discussion ==
Note that the setvalues inside the repeat blocks do not work.  I have tried to use the current() function inside the repeat like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;xf:repeat&gt;
      &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;current()/@selected&quot; value=&quot;'false'&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


but with no luck.

If anyone knows how to get this working, please let us know.  Thanks - Dan

==== Alternate Way ====
Note: &lt;xf:repeat&gt; does not work inside &lt;xf:action&gt;. 
Here is the workaround for this.

&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;count&quot;&gt;
       &lt;count/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:instance&gt;    
   &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;instance('count')&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;xf:trigger&gt;
       &lt;xf:label&gt;Select all repeat&lt;/xf:label&gt;
       &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
           &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('count')&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xf:action while=&quot;instance('count') &amp;lt; count(item)&quot;&gt;
              &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('count')&quot; value=&quot;instance('count') + 1&quot; /&gt;
	      &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;item[number(instance('count'))]/@selected&quot; value=&quot;'true'&quot; /&gt;	
           &lt;/xf:action&gt;
	&lt;/xf:action&gt;
    &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lesson Three: Advanced numbers, Plurals, and Interrogatives'''

==Numbers==
&lt;!-- how do you say twenty one? --&gt;
Here is a list of more advanced numbers;
'''thirty'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  ''thirty''
'''fowerty'''  ''forty''
'''fifty'''  ''fifty''
'''saxty'''  ''sixty''
'''seiventy'''  ''seventy''
'''aichty'''  ''eighty''
&lt;!-- what's ninety? --&gt;
'''hunder'''  ''hundred''
'''thoosand'''  ''thousand''

===Ordinal, Cardinal===
Numbers like &quot;ane&quot;, &quot;twa&quot;, and &quot;three&quot; are cardinal numbers, and that means that they are a generalized kind of number used to denote the size of a set. That's what you've learned so far. Ordinal numbers, however are another type of number used to accommodate infinite sequences and to classify sets with certain kinds of order structures on them. In English, Cardinal numbers would be &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;third&quot;, though most numbers have &quot;-th&quot; added to them. In Scots, you generally add a &quot;-t&quot; to the end of the word, like so.
*Scots: seicont, fowert, fift, saxt, seivent.
*English: second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.

Notice how &quot;first&quot; and &quot;third&quot; weren't included in that list. That's because they are irregular like in English. In Scots, &quot;first&quot; is &quot;first&quot;, or sometimes &quot;foremaist&quot;, and &quot;third&quot; is &quot;thrid&quot; or &quot;third&quot;.


*&lt;Small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Also &quot;thritty&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Plural form==
Plural is when the word becomes more than one. In English, the plural form is usually &quot;-(e)s&quot;. In Lowland Scots, nouns usually form their plural by adding &quot;-(e)s&quot; to the end of a word, but some irregular plurals occur. For example; &quot;ee&quot;/&quot;een&quot; (&quot;eye&quot;/&quot;eyes&quot;), &quot;cauf&quot;/&quot;caur&quot; (&quot;calf&quot;/&quot;calves&quot;), &quot;horse&quot;/&quot;horse&quot; (&quot;horse&quot;/&quot;horses&quot;), &quot;cou&quot;/&quot;kye&quot; (&quot;cow&quot;/&quot;cows&quot;), &quot;shae&quot;/&quot;shuin&quot; (&quot;shoe&quot;/&quot;shoes&quot;). Nouns of measure and quantity unchanged in the plural. Words include, &quot;fower fit&quot; (&quot;four feet&quot;), &quot;twa mile&quot; (&quot;two miles&quot;), &quot;five pund&quot; (&quot;five pounds&quot;), &quot;three hunderwecht&quot; (&quot;three hundredweight&quot;). Regular plurals include &quot;laifs&quot; (&quot;loaves&quot;), &quot;leafs&quot; (&quot;leaves&quot;), &quot;shelfs&quot; (&quot;shelves&quot;) and &quot;wifes&quot; (&quot;wives&quot;), etc.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Note that at least one fan site has placed the '''''Battle of Hogwarts''''' as occurring on 2 May, which would mean [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] had returned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] the evening of 1 May. The author has stated also that this date should be possible to determine from the text.
 
The climactic battle of the entire series is fought as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] returns to Hogwarts in search of what he believes to be the last-but-one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], in hopes of destroying it and thus taking nearly the final step in blocking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s apparent immortality. Learning of Harry's mission, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] assists in the sacking of headmaster [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], and in preparing the school to be besieged. All underage wizards, and all of Slytherin house, are evacuated, and the remaining wizards, being the school staff and of-age students, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]], prepare to meet the attack of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. During the preparations, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] opens the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], and with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], destroys the Cup Horcrux that they have been carrying, using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] fangs.

Harry has determined that the last Horcrux is probably Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem, and recalls that he had seen it in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. He, Ron, and Hermione enter the Room, but are followed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. In the ensuing fight, Harry finds and loses the diadem, and Crabbe eventually sets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]]. The Fiendfyre consumes everything in the room, including Crabbe, but Harry and Ron rescue Draco and Goyle. Harry also catches the diadem, which is being tossed around by the fire; as he examines it after exiting the room, it screams thinly and falls apart.

The battle is raging fiercely now, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] inside the school. Hermione asks Harry to look into Voldemort's mind and say where he is. Harry finds that he is in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]]. Making their way there through the tunnel under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]], the Trio arrive just in time to see Voldemort murder Snape, in the belief that this will allow him to tap the full power of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]]. As his last living act, Snape gives Harry a jar of his memories. Unseen, Voldemort announces a one-hour break in hostilities, and promises that if Harry will come to him in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], nobody else will be harmed.

The Trio return to the school, where Harry, alone, takes Snape's memories and places them in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. There, he learns that Snape had been acting always to preserve Harry's life, at Dumbledore's request, out of Snape's unrequited love for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Harry's mother]]. Knowing now that he, himself, is acting as an accidental Horcrux, Harry leaves the school to find Voldemort. Using the Elder Wand, Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Harry.

Harry, surprisingly, does not seem to be dead, but is, instead, in a sort of way station that looks like King's Cross railway station. Here he meets Dumbledore, and has much that was puzzling him explained, including that Voldemort's using Harry's blood in his reanimation had extended the protection granted by Lily's blood: so long as Voldemort lived, he could not kill Harry. Harry, given the choice of going onwards or going back, chooses to go back and finish Voldemort once and for all.

Returning to his body in the Forest, Harry plays dead, and Voldemort has him carried to Hogwarts. There, Voldemort taunts the defenders, though his jinxes seem ineffective. When he chooses to torture [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], by putting the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] on his head and setting it afire, Neville produces the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] from the hat and beheads [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]].

As Voldemort screams in anger, reinforcements arrive for the defenders, and the battle is rejoined. It eventually centers in the Great Hall, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] is defeated by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]. Harry and Voldemort now duel, and Voldemort's Killing Curse again rebounds, killing him.

== Event Details ==

Note: this battle covers several chapters of the final book in the series. As such, the event details are quite lengthy. In the course of the battle, notably in the hiatus, several plot points that do not have to do directly with the battle are discussed and resolved. As they do not have any effect on the course of the battle itself, they will be skipped for reasons of length. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], sensing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s thoughts when he is told that the cup [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] has been stolen, learns that the one Horcrux they have not yet been able to identify is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. With [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], he resolves to get there first and prevent Voldemort retrieving it. Arriving at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], they are caught by the curfew, and are rescued by the innkeeper at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], who Harry identifies as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]]. Once Harry convinces Aberforth to help them, he shows them a secret passage which leads to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] within Hogwarts School.

There, Harry finds many members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], who had found the school too hot for them but wanted to stay, in order to continue with their program of guerrilla warfare against the current administration. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who had become the leader of the group, says that he had used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]] that Hermione had [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|bewitched]] earlier to recall all of the DA, and sure enough, past DA members start arriving through the tunnel from the Hog's Head. Asking about missing artifacts of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]], Harry is told about her lost diadem, and decides that this is almost certainly what Voldemort would have used for his Horcrux. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] takes Harry to the Ravenclaw common room, to see a statue of Rowena with the diadem so that he knows what to look for. He is caught there by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], who summons Voldemort by way of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] on her arm, and is then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] by Luna. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] then arrive. When Amycus decides that he will blame Alecto's summoning of Voldemort on the students, McGonagall refuses to put her students in danger, whereupon Amycus spits at her. Harry, outraged, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|curses]] him. Revealing himself to McGonagall, Harry says that he is hunting something in Hogwarts, at Dumbledore's request, and that Voldemort is on his way to try and find the same object. McGonagall sends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] messengers to summon the other Heads of House, and starts for the Great Hall. On the way, the way, they encounter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Headmaster Snape]], and he and McGonagall duel. As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] arrive, followed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], Snape retreats into an empty classroom, jumps out the window, and flies off into the night.

Returning to the Room of Requirement, Harry finds that several members of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] have arrived, but Ron and Hermione have vanished. He tells the assembled people that Voldemort is on his way, and that the fighters are gathering in the Great Hall for instructions. An argument breaks out with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who wants to help fight; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly]] eventually relents to the point of allowing Ginny to stay at Hogwarts if she stays in the Room of Requirement. As this conversation winds up, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] arrives and declares that he was a stupid prat, that he has left the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] and wants to rejoin the family. He is welcomed with open arms.

While Harry wanders the halls searching for Ron and Hermione, the school's defences are prepared. At Professor McGonagall's command, statues and suits of armor come suddenly to life all over the castle, arming themselves and taking up positions on the battlements. We see Professor Sprout and Neville planning defences using the dangerous plants from the greenhouses, and meet again with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], as he is thrown into the school through a window with his boarhound, Fang, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]]. Still searching either for inspiration, or for Ron and Hermione, Harry goes to the Great Hall. Here, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] informs the students of the plan to defend their school. All students are asked to leave, except those who are of age who want to help. Suddenly, Voldemort's voice rings through the hall. Voldemort informs the school that if they surrender Harry to him by midnight, nobody in the school will be hurt. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] spots Harry, and stands, shrieking for someone to grab him; all of Gryffindor house rises in a mass, pointing wands at the Slytherins, almost immediately followed by all of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Professor McGonagall announces that all of Slytherin house will be evacuated, though those of age in the other three houses are welcome to stay if they wish.

Prompted by Professor McGonagall, Harry again sets out in search of the Horcrux. A phrase nags at him: &quot;not seen in living memory.&quot; Perhaps the ghosts would know, they have been around much longer than anyone else. Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], and asks him where he might find the Ravenclaw house ghost. Somewhat miffed at having his own offer of help dismissed, Nick indicates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|The Grey Lady]], and Harry eventually chases her down. Talking to her, he finds that she is the ghost of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s daughter, and that in life she had stolen her mother's diadem and hidden it in a forest in Albania. She ashamedly admits to having told one other student about it, many years before. Harry privately thinks that the Grey Lady is only one of many who have been hoodwinked by Tom Riddle. He now remembers having seen an old diadem before; he had, in fact, used it to mark the location in the Room of Requirement where he had hidden his Potions book the year before.

As he is returning to the Room of Requirement, Harry finds Ron and Hermione. Ron had opened the Chamber of Secrets by mimicking the sounds Harry had made to open the Locket, and Hermione had recovered several [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] fangs, using one of them to destroy the Cup Horcrux. The Trio return to the Room of Requirement to clear it out, finding Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|Mrs. Longbottom]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] there. Tonks demands to know where her husband Remus Lupin is, and Harry tells her he was planning on taking a group of fighters into the grounds. Mrs. Longbottom immediately goes to join in the battle, and Tonks to find her husband. Once Harry finally clears everyone out of the Room of Requirement, he re-opens it as the junk storage warehouse where he had placed the diadem. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter and start searching for the diadem; as Harry finds it, however, he is cornered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and his sidekicks, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. The ensuing duel ends when Crabbe sets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]], a magical fire that consumes all. Harry spots some old brooms, and the Trio mount them to escape; as they leave, though, Harry sees Malfoy and Goyle and rescues them, then sees the Diadem being thrown about by the Fiendfyre and grabs that as well. As they fly out into the corridor, the door slams shut behind them and vanishes. Now landed, Harry watches as the diadem screams thinly and falls apart. Hermione mentions that Fiendfyre is another of the very few things that will destroy Horcruxes.

Harry realizes that it is midnight, and the attack on the school has begun. Details are few and far between at first.  Death Eaters, clearly based out of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], come streaming out in great numbers. They are flanked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|giants]] and by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|huge spiders]] of the forest. Curses and jinxes fly in every direction, lighting up the sky in green and red. The giants savagely attack the school, demolishing its walls in places.  The spiders attack as well, swarming up the walls and into the holes created by the giants. Harry meets Percy and Fred in the halls; Percy jinxes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], saying that Thicknesse may consider that his resignation. An explosion shatters the walls, and falling stones kill Fred.

Voldemort is strangely missing from the battle as student and Order members fight side-by-side in small gangs. Battles rage in the main grounds, the Entrance Hall and outside the Great Hall.  Even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] gets a piece of the action, hurling dangerous roots at the Death Eaters and taunting them. Hermione asks Harry to locate Voldemort; Harry enters Voldemort's mind and sees him dispatching a haggard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] to fetch Severus Snape. Harry reports that Voldemort is in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]].

Harry, Ron, and Hermione head for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] and the secret passage to the Shrieking Shack. Blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], Harry is rescued by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] casting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronuses]] to drive them away. They are separated from the Trio by giants, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron enter the tunnel under the Whomping Willow alone.

In the Shrieking Shack, Harry sees Voldemort talking to Snape. Voldemort is disappointed in the performance of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] that he had taken from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] tomb. He clearly believes that the Wand currently owes allegiance to Snape because Snape had killed Dumbledore, and will not be fully Voldemort's until Snape dies. So saying, he throws [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] at Snape. Nagini bites Snape, and Voldemort leaves with Nagini. Harry leaves concealment to try and help Snape. Snape releases a large quantity of memory, which Harry gathers in a crystal vial. Snape then dies, looking into Harry's eyes.

Suddenly, just as the Death Eaters were gaining the upper hand, the battle ceases; Voldemort calls his troops back. He issues a warning to all inside, telling them that if they do not hand over Harry Potter in one hour, he will order his troops to kill everyone in Hogwarts. Harry, Hermione, and Ron return to the school through the tunnel, and Hermione and Ron enter the Great Hall to mourn the losses of their friends. Harry, ashamed at the damage he has caused, takes the vial of memories to the headmaster's office and examines them with Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. In Snape's memories, Harry finds that Snape, always loyal to Dumbledore because of a promise he had made out of his unrequited love for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Harry's mother]], had been playing a dangerous double game, protecting Harry while pretending to be Voldemort's most loyal lieutenant, and that a shard of Voldemort's soul had broken off and adhered to Harry when Voldemort had tried to kill him. Dumbledore believes that Harry must be killed by Voldemort to destroy this soul shard.

Knowing that he must die, Harry now leaves the headmaster's office and heads for the Forbidden Forest. Passing Neville on the grounds, he tells Neville that if he does not return from where he is going, Voldemort's snake must be killed. Finding the Resurrection Stone inside the Golden Snitch that Dumbledore had left, Harry summons the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shades]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. They protect him from the Dementors as he walks through the forest. Reaching the Death Eaters' campsite, Harry drops the Resurrection Stone, and the shades vanish. Voldemort, spotting Harry, attempts to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kill]] him.

Harry finds himself in a place that looks like King's Cross Station. There he speaks with Dumbledore, who tells him that the soul shard that had been stuck to him is now gone, and that Harry has the choice to go back and defeat Voldemort, or to go onwards. Harry chooses to go back, in the hopes of finally defeating Voldemort.

Returning to the Forbidden Forest, Harry plays dead. From what he hears, it seems that Voldemort has apparently also fallen unconscious, but is now reviving. He orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] to examine Harry, to see if he is dead. Narcissa, hearing from Harry that Draco is still alive and in the school, and knowing that the only way to go to him is to end the war, lies to Voldemort, saying that Harry is dead. Voldemort forces Hagrid to carry Harry out of the forest and back to the school. 

As the hour elapses, the forces inside Hogwarts are awaiting the next wave of attack when Voldemort's voice sounds around them.  He presents Harry Potter's body to the assembled forces.  Aghast, the Defenders of Hogwarts shriek their rage at the Dark Lord. Neville stands against the Dark Lord, and Voldemort brings the Sorting Hat from the Headmaster's office, forces it down over Neville's head, and sets it afire. Neville produces the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] from the hat and cuts off Nagini's head, and the battle is renewed.  This time the Hogwarts' forces are bolstered by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], joining battle from the Forest; by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House Elves]], who charge out of the Hogwarts kitchens bearing knives and attack the Death Eaters savagely; and by a crowd of reinforcements, apparently composed of the parents and neighbours of every child in Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff House from all over the country.

Most of the Death Eaters are quickly routed; Voldemort and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] continue to fend off those fighting them. Harry, under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], follows the battle into the Great Hall. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], protecting her children, kills Bellatrix Lestrange, Voldemort turns his wand on Molly. Harry, revealing himself as he shields Molly, gives Voldemort the chance to redeem himself; he refuses, and tries to kill Harry. His curse again rebounds, and Voldemort dies of his own killing curse.

== Notable Consequences ==

Ron's suddenly thinking about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]] in the kitchens, and telling Hermione that they ought to warn them, is a turning point in their relationship. Hermione recognizes it as a sign of maturity, that Ron is now thinking of others, and it deepens her love for him.

The battle results, indirectly, in the destruction of the soul shard adhering to Harry, and of Nagini, Voldemort's final Horcrux. With the destruction of five Horcruxes prior to this, Voldemort's immortality is ended, and when Voldemort dies, it is permanent.

The death of Voldemort and many of his followers brings Voldemort's second reign of terror to an end. Wizarding Britain, which has been living in fear for the last two years, suddenly finds itself again free from the grasp of the Death Eaters and their leader, Lord Voldemort. Harry Potter, without a doubt one of the people most affected by the war, having lost parents, godfather, mentor, and many friends, now finds himself free of the burden that was placed on him before his birth, when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] named him as the only one that could defeat the Dark Lord. This will also give him freedom to pursue what he has always wished: a family of his own, which he hopes to find next to Ginny Weasley.

== Analysis ==

One of the signs of Harry's increasing maturity is his treatment of the Hallows. As he confronts Voldemort, he knows that he has just released one of the Hallows to fall, unseen and irretrievable, on the forest floor; he is carrying another under his robe; and he believes the third, although it is in Voldemort's hand, currently owes its allegiance to him. During his walk through the forest, he has effectively united all three of the Hallows under his command, and so has, if the legend holds, conquered Death. When he faces Voldemort, he believes that he will die, and he is naturally afraid. A less mature wizard would have assumed the words of the legend were literal, and would have clutched the three Hallows to himself, in the belief that they would shield him from death. Harry knows that it is the man who is not afraid of Death who has truly conquered it, as death itself cannot be denied, but the fear of death is often far worse than death itself. Knowing this, Harry has decided that he will not allow the fear of death to prevent him from doing what he must, and with that decision has conquered death. Having done so, he no longer needs the Hallows, and we will see that he releases two of the three, keeping only the Cloak which he intends to pass on to his son.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

This being the climactic battle of the entire series, it must draw together all the dangling threads of the seven-book narrative. As a device to allow these threads to be drawn together and tied up, the battle actually has been written with an intermission. During this intermission, we first see Snape's memories of events, which explains many of the paradoxes surrounding Snape's actions, and finally reveals Snape's motivations throughout the entire series, as well as the riddle of Dumbledore's damaged hand in the previous year. Then, in the Waystation, Dumbledore ties up the threads involving the Hallows, Harry's soul fragment, and aspects of wandlore as they affect Harry through the story. A purist might suggest that this was an awkward way of getting the necessary information to us, but perhaps it is a measure of Rowling's skill that this device feels true to the nature of Snape, Voldemort, and Dumbledore. It does seem, however, that after having briefly decided to chart his own course, Harry is once again placed in a situation where he can only react to what is going on around him.

One thing that should be mentioned is that the soul fragment adhering to Harry, while it presumably would work like a Horcrux to hold the remnants of Voldemort's soul to the Earth, is not a Horcrux. There is more information on this in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes#Greater Picture|Horcruxes]] topic, but in brief, indications are that the Elder Wand, even when wielded by its true master, does not have the necessary power to destroy a Horcrux. The fact that the soul fragment adhering to Harry is destroyed by the Elder Wand would argue that it is not a Horcrux. It is also true that the necessary magic to create a Horcrux and tie it completely to a physical object was not performed; Voldemort, dying from the rebounding spell that had been meant to kill Harry, would not have been able to perform that magic.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:44, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

== Stroller pages ==

In practice there is a copyright message on the website.  As such we need explicit permission of the website owner to host material here.  Regrettably your message (?) on the talk page is inadequate, sorry --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:44, 26 July 2007 (UTC)
:Hi Sarah - I was just trying to answer you [[Talk:Buying the Right Stroller|here]] as you were posting to me.  I understand it from you point of view however there is no legal &quot;proof&quot; that you have the right to grant the license I'm afraid.  Read through the link and the copyright bits.  For more help the [[WB:SL|staff lounge]] may be the best place to ask (won't be dependent on whether a particular individual is online).  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:07, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

Hello Sarah, welcome to Wikibooks! I left a message to you and Herby on his talk page about this issue. If you are who you say you are, if the material is under the GFDL, and if this is what you want, you should be able to upload your preexisting materials here. We have had donations of preexisting materials before without hassle, so I can't imagine that in this case everybody is going to raise a big stink. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:17, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

:Aplogies for the confusion Sarah - we will sort it!  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:51, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

::I got the links, checked them out, and I can see the copyright tags for GFDL. So long as the page is GFDL, it doesnt matter whether you are the author or not (although it's nice that you are!). I would post some links back to the original website just to be safe. 
::Anyway, sorry about all this mess, i wish you luck here on wikibooks, and if you have any questions or if you need any help, please feel free to ask me any time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:26, 31 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">G'day Richard Giuly, welcome to Wikibooks. I see you've started a book on [[Continuum Mechanics]], and note that you use a bit of mathematical formulae. You might be interested to try your hand at the MathML extension, which allows you to express your formulas in a richer format; see [[m:Help:Displaying a formula]]. And now, here's our stock standard welcome block:

G'day, can you explain please how this template is useful? It presently only provides the pipe character, |, which is generally available on standard keyboards, and if it isn't present or doesn't work, it is available as a special character when editing (look underneath the edit box). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:17, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

:Aha, I see that you're using it to put the pipe character into your templates! There is already a solution for that, standard across all wiki projects: {{tl|!}}
:See [[m:Help:Template#A parameter value containing a pipe character]] for details. If you can fix your templates to use this instead of {{tl|pipe}}, I can delete that template for you. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:27, 27 July 2007 (UTC)
::Yes, I can. [[User:Eyu100|Eyu100]] 00:43, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Thanks, have deleted the pipe template now. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:22, 27 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

Back on topic, I don't know much about water, since I purchase water from the store for my brews and have never paid much attention to modifying waters to emulate given beers or beer styles, since such anal control over my beer has not yet occured to me as a worthwhile endevour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PD-PhilippinesGov==
G'day, {{tl|PD-PhilippinesGov}} poses a interesting problem. Images using this license tag (there are two at present) aren't really ''public domain'' because they may not be used for commercial purposes without permission of the authors. As such, would they be acceptable under this policy? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:09, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

:I would say no, but I've clarified the public domain section of this proposal to make that clearer. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:25, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

::Much what I was thinking. The [[:Image:Ph seal of pampanga.png|seal]] could possibly stay under Fair Use provisions, if it is actually necessary (although a quick glance at the only page using it suggests that it isn't necessary). The [[:Image:Kalahi-Cidss-Seeing-Poverty-Clearly-Banner.jpg|banner]] is purely decorative, however, so I might notify the uploader that their image will be deleted soon. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:31, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

== Approval as policy ==

We should approve this as policy. A link to the Foundation resolution for the sake of convenience: [[foundation:Resolution:Licensing policy]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:33, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

*{{Support}}. I don't find any serious fault with this proposal as written. It's a pretty good match to the de facto way we've been handling images now for a long time. In essence, I dont think that this policy is going to change anything, and it will help to cover our assess if the foundation decides to try to enforce that resolution that mike linked to. Without a media policy (called an &quot;EDP&quot; in the resolution), we are not allowed to have any fair use images, and so all of our existing fair use images would need to be deleted. The alternative to this policy, which I think maintains the status quo, would be a massive purge of fair use images. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:41, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}}. I modified the screenshot clause slightly, as some licensees make certain demands on how their screenshots are used. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:41, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
*{{support|Strong support}} - This really does describe what we've been doing in the past. Plus it makes sense. I'm ''very'' happy with the explicit rejection of allowing a fair use claim on media a user has created themselves, media used with permission, and &quot;commissioned&quot; works. There are several media files which would be excluded by this policy coming into force, and getting rid of them is absolutely the right thing to do. As well, the rejection of decorative uses of non-free media is great, and so is requiring the deletion of unused non-free media. &lt;s&gt;Finally, there is an implicit requirement to use {{tlx|Fair use rationale}} to provide that, but I'm going to make it explicit in order to comply with the resolution linked above.&lt;/s&gt; &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:47, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
*:What was wrong with the requirement for a fair use rationale? If there is discussion about this, can it please take place in the open (i.e. talk pages), not in cloistered hallways? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
*::I don't think there was a problem with using a rationale, I think the problem was in requiring people to use that particular template. I think I agree with Mike though, using that template will help to keep things standard, so I think we should require it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:52, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
*::No, that requirement is still present in the current revision in 2 separate places. The change I made then reverted would have required a particular template be used, which wasn't non-controversial and should therefore be discussed first. I hadn't gotten around to explaining that in full here; I got distracted. I still think we should require the use of a template (actually a [[Template:Fair use rationale|single template]] for consistency's sake) because ''A)'' it makes good sense (this is what templates are for) and ''B)'' I believe that is the intent of the &quot;machine-readable&quot; clause in the Foundation resolution. Either way, I'd support this policy, but I think the change I made (then reverted) would be an improvement. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:56, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
*::Nobody that I know of is questioning the need for rationals. I think requiring rationals is something too new for Wikibooks to be saying only one specific template must be used in order to be acceptable. There may be many ways to supply a rational that may work, and the community should be free to experiment with that. I don't think it makes good sense to limit our options right now, when as a community there is no history for the use of and the requiring of rationals to determine what is acceptable or not. I believe the intent of the [[w:machine-readable|machine-readable]] clause is about making sure rationals are supplied in a computer format that is easily accessible to anyone using any computer or OS, rather then for instance suppling a hard copy only, providing a rational upon request over the phone, or providing a rational in other way that would require extra work to supply on a computer. In short its a single template only verses allowing many possible templates disagreement rather then a disagreement over rationals. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:54, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' The proposed policy should be revised as there are inconsistencies on its text, a lot of legal babel that could and should be avoided. There is no need to define specific interpretations of licenses on the proposed text (the use of wikipedia links would suffice and reduce errors. As an example I point out that &quot;Public domain works are works not protected by copyright laws&quot; is not correct (see [[w:Public domain|Public domain]]). Removing that extra fat from the text would make it more readable and simplify its use. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:42, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
:Since [[User:Darklama]] reverted my changes I also point out that at Wikibooks we don't use the GFDL but the GFDL [[Wikibooks:Copyright|with some restrictions]] (that is '''GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts''' ), this distinction on this proposal text isn't very important but we should aim to make this clear to users and the text deals with specific licensing issues. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:54, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

:: Did you read [[w:Public domain]]? It says in the section on &quot;No legal restriction on use&quot;:
:: {{cquote|A creative work is said to be in the public domain if there are no laws which restrict its use by the public at large. For instance, a work may be in the public domain if no laws establish proprietary rights over the work, or if the work or its subject matter are specifically excluded from existing laws.''}}
:: I don't know what legal babel your talking about. There isn't anything in this proposal about legal issues or legal talk, only a brief summary of what public domain is, what non-free use is, and what free licenses are as it applies to this project and to Wikimedia projects on the whole. I don't think the information on public domain is incorrect, nor do I see any &quot;extra fat&quot; in this policy.
:: This policy isn't about specific licensing issues, as that is a legal issue. This policy is about what types of media content is acceptable for use on Wikibooks. We've already been over the fact and established that we disagree on the interpretation of the GFDL enough. Don't try to turn this into an issue over trying to prove a point. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:12, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

::: And ?!? PD works '''are''' under protection of the copyright law, they are public property but their use may also have some restrictions, like the obligation in providing information about the original author, there are many nuances to PD, In PD the authorship of the work doesn't change, the creator is the same only the ownership defaults to the public. One case were copyright law can be called upon to protect PD is to establish authorship of a work (I can't see any other instance were any other user, change or alteration would cause problems).
::: The problem is that the summary isn't brief or even needed on the proposed text, all could be done under a generalization   of the final objectives and links to wikipedia could be given to enable users to learn more about the specific licenses so they could check about them if they need to.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:41, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
::::Sorry, I don't see how any of this is relevant to approving the policy. Panic: Are there requirements or prohibitions in the proposal that you disagree with? If so, which ones? If not, please don't drag us off-course and towards territory adequately discussed in the past, and best left alone.

So we understand each other I repeat that the mention of Wikibooks use of the GFDL should be corrected and the verbosity of the text should be reduced, I don't see the point for it to include some phrases like &quot;These freedoms may not be restricted, and attempting to restrict these freedoms for an image or media file is grounds for immediate deletion of that file.&quot; it is unnecessary since anything uploaded would have to respect the previously mentioned freedoms (there is no way around it open for abuse). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:28, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

----
As there was enthusiastic support, and the comments from Panic are vaguely supportive as well, I have declared this as now being policy. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:02, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

== Updates ==

I updated this for the license transition, but it also needs to be updated to reflect that we now point uploads to Commons by default, and allow only fair use media on Wikibooks. Users who have read and understand this policy and can show they have a need to do so can request local upload rights for those media files. As well, we should think about updating the upload form to reflect all of the above. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:55, 15 January 2010 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''Anapneo''''' is a spell that is used to clear a blocked airway.

== Extended description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Professor Slughorn cast this spell on Marcus Belby when the latter began to choke after swallowing too fast.

== Analysis ==

The incantation for this spell is based on the Greek πνοη (breath), which is also seen in a number of words in English starting with &quot;pneu-&quot;; the prefixed α may mean &quot;no&quot; with the αν in front of that negating the negative, to change this to mean &quot;restore stopped breath&quot;.

All the pages Freedom of Information Act 2000/anything should be moved to WikiSource, I think. They're not textbooks. I'm not sure if WS covers legislative text, but WB certainly doesn't.
Take a look at a few:
*[[Freedom of Information Act 2000/Part 1c]]
*[[Freedom of Information Act 2000/Part 1d]]
*[[Freedom of Information Act 2000/Part 3]]
*[[Freedom of Information Act 2000/Schedule 1(I-V)]]

:Sorry, I tagged all of them with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; but I went back and changed them to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{transwiki|wikisource}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, seeing as how that's more appropriate. Someone who knows how should do that, and ''then'' delete them. I guess I'll close this 'debate'. -[[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 05:16, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

I've posted a message at Wikisource about these pages, asking if they are acceptable. If Wikisource turns them down, should I reopen this VfD, or simply delete the pages? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:08, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:I'd say there covered rather clearly under [[wikisource:Wikisource:What Wikisource includes#Documentary sources]]. If not, then I'd delete them - legislation is available online from the government, so there's no need to have them on wiki at all, much less on WB.

:Actually these are Crown Copyright, which as far as I know is not compatable with the GFDL. (Which is kind of ironic for a freedom of information act, now that I think about it :P)--[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:49, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

::I had to go back and check what country this Act was from. Apparently, UK Crown Copyright is explicitly ''not'' compatible with the GFDL (etc.) so it is a copyright violation on top of not being a textbook. Even if WS will take legislation, they can't keep this stuff because it'd be a copyvio.

:'''Very Weak Keep''' - Only because this really is more of an appendix to [[Open Source]], and if it isn't deleted, it perhaps ought to be formally made into a supplimentary appendix of that Wikibook as a page move.  This is an '''''old Wikibook''''', with the first edits going back to nearly the very beginning of this project, which is why I even hesitate.  Yes, Wikibooks has adapted and changed to a more textboook focus, but this has not been a book which has been hiding in a back corner of Wikibooks either.  It has been mentioned as a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Freeware|candidate for merged content]] in VfD discussions, [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/February 2005 voting|a Book of the Month candidate]], and is [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Freeware|heavily linked]] to other Wikibooks content.  This last point especially shows somewhat of the age of this content... which is one of the criticisms above.  While not a textbook, it is a directory, and one of the potential ideas for what Wikibooks may have been if a hard-core textbook only philosophy hadn't taken ahold here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:38, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

I removed a speedy tag from this.  Deletionist that I may be (I'm getting better) this page is not in my opinion able to be deleted speedily.  The narrative on the tag was ''Unnecessary to maintain here, can be accessed directly some other way. This is asking to get stale and a far better interface is already available at the actual source of this data.'' I'm sure [[User:Withinfocus]] with be along to give their views.  For now I have no vote --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:56, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:There has never been the urge here at wikibooks, like there is at wikipedia or other wikis, for users to categorize themselves. Your average wikibooks user has fewer &quot;user boxes&quot; on their pages: we make fewer boxes and we use fewer boxes. To a degree, i think people are prefectly contented with this situation. I mention this to say that this page, like so many user categories, is interesting but is ultimately not really needed around here. Edit counts change every day. I know, that in a good swing, I can amass more then 100 edits a day. This list therefore is a loose approximation, at best, of a person's edit counts. At worst this list is an inaccurate representation of the worth of our many editors. I do agree that there are places where this information is better represented, such as the various edit counters or the statistics pages or whatever. This list just can't be maintained and should probably be deleted (or locked for historical purposes, with a note to the fact). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:42, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' I don't find this to be useful, time spent maintaining this would be better spent explaining how to access the source of the information in the help space. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:19, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' - It's all been said above. This is an unnecessary maintenance task. I like Xixtas' recommendation to mention the live tool to get this data somewhere in the Help namespace, but we don't need a Main namespace page that I can almost guarantee will get stale often. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:38, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' - I agree that this shouldn't be a speedy. However, this list will constantly be stale and keeping it fresh(ish) will be a drain on manpower that could be better used in other ways. Instead, we should find a way to automatically create a list of the top 20/50/100/... contributors by edit count (which may or may not be possible - I have no experience with the software's inner workings). At the very least, make some instructions to get the data straight from the source. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:55, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' - pointless information. Knowing that a user contributes a fair amount might be useful (and can be determined in several different ways), but a list like this does little good and suffers from all the problems listed at the top of the page. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:04, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''', I don't really see too much historical value in this, since all the older numbers are outdated and not really useful for anything. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:36, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

== Here We Go ==

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] 20:38, 7 September 2007 (UTC)
All the people from USA I have met online are never connected to engineering. :( Well, cheers, to the mechanical engineering in the making. I myself am trying to get a course at the IITs hopefully in 2008.

I've been thinking of editing my notes and classroom illustrations and putting them here on wikibooks to be able to help people out, especially in India, where we have a lot of sub standard books that aim to capitalize on the lack of awareness of the students.

Presently, the idea is in the making, because I am formulating a modus operandi ;) to get the work done efficiently.

Since I have completed a highschool course in Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Calculus and misc. Mathematics Topics, Physics (except Relativistic Mechanics) and Chemistry (all of the three branches), I have a sound knowledge of the pre-requisites of chemistry. And basically, even I am self-studying.

Because you have been proficient with Computer Languages and their syntaxes, you will be of great help to the various projects going around!!

Do care to drop in at [[Problems In Highschool Chemistry]], I will be adding content to it and other wikibooks regularly, and run a forum to discuss the possibilities, ups and down etc. --[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] 20:38, 7 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of this page is to provide a list of all relevant music, guitar and guitar related terms, arranged alphabetically. Ideally they should be kept brief, around two to three sentences.

==List of Terms==

* '''Archtop:''' A type of electric guitar that has a hollow body. Therefore making it part acoustic and part electric. This hybrid construction means the tone of these guitars differs from the solid-body electric guitar. They are used extensively by guitarists who play jazz.

* '''B.C. Rich:''' is a manufacturer of guitars and bass guitars founded by the late Bernardo Chavez Rico in 1969. Currently most B.C. Rich guitars are manufactured in Asia but luthiers of the company's custom shop continue to hand-make instruments. Hanser Music Group now operates the Southern California B.C. Rich custom shop. As of 2001, no member of the Rico family is involved in the production of B.C. Rich guitars.

* '''Blues Scale:''' a pentatonic scale with the addition of the &quot;blue&quot; note: diminished fifth.   

* '''Chromatic scale:''' Western music organizes its twelve sounds into a scale known as the chromatic scale. The chromatic scale is available at different frequencies. This can best be seen on the layout of the keyboard with its five black keys and seven white keys representing successive registers of the chromatic scale.

* '''Cutaway:''' Applicable to acoustics since electric guitar can take virtually any shape. A place on the body of the guitar where part of the body front and back is &quot;cut away&quot;, and then the sides wrapped around the removed area. The result looks like a regular acoustic guitar. The purpose of the cutaway is to allow the guitarist's hand to fret notes further down the neck.

* '''EMG Incorporated:''' A company based in Santa Rosa, California, which manufactures guitar pickups.  Founded in 1976, the company was originally called &quot;Dirtywork Studios&quot;.  The name was changed to &quot;Overlend&quot; (spelled &quot;Overland&quot; in some sources.  &quot;EMG&quot; stands for &quot;Electro-Magnetic Generator&quot;. EMG pickups are standard equipment on some models from guitar manufacturers such as BC Rich, ESP Guitars, Ibanez and Jackson Guitars.

* '''Epiphone Company:''' A musical instrument manufacturer founded in 1873 by Anastasios Stathopoulos.  Epiphone was bought by Chicago Music Company, who also owned Gibson Guitar Corporation, in 1957. Epiphone was Gibson's main rival in the archtop guitar market. Their professional archtops, including the Emperor, Deluxe, Broadway and Triumph. Aside from their guitars, Epiphone also made bass guitars, banjos and other stringed instruments.  However, the company's weakness in the aftermath of World War II allowed Gibson to absorb it.　

* '''Feedback:''' A high pitched sound that comes through an amplification system when the output from the speakers or amplifiers are picked up by the microphones or pickups, creating an infinite loop.

* '''Fret:''' The fretboard of the guitar is divided into twelve squares known as frets. Fretwire is the name given to the thin metal strips that are hammered into the wood of the fretboard to delineate each fret. When you press a string down within a fret, you change the length of the string and therefore the frequency that it vibrates at.

* '''Fretboard:''' The thin piece of wood attached to the face of the neck on the front side of the guitar. It consists of the frets and provides a smooth surface for the guitarist's fingers to make contact with.

* '''Guitar:''' A  stringed musical instrument (chordophone) that is plucked when played. A descendant of the Spanish vihuela (16th century) and the earlier medieval four-course Latin guitar.

* '''Headshell:''' The plastic or metal covering on the end of a piece of cabling use to connect to an amplifier.

* '''Headstock:''' The piece on the end of the neck that has the tuning pegs and nut attached to it.

* '''Humbucker:''' A type of pickup that uses two coils at opposite polarity, thereby eliminating some of the background hum on single coil pickups.

* '''Ibanez:''' A guitar brand owned by Hoshino Gakki and based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. Hoshino Gakki were one of the first Japanese musical instrument companies to gain a significant foothold in the United States and Europe. 

* '''Interval:''' A name used to describe the relationship between two notes. There are two types of intervals in music: harmonic or melodic. The numerical part of the interval name is found by counting the letters used in notation: C to E is an interval of a third, F to D is an interval of a sixth.

* '''Jazz:''' An American music genre that has its origins in the ragtime and blues music of the early 1900s. Jazz music is characterized by collective improvisation, the use of syncopation and an extended harmonic approach to chords. 

* '''Masonite:''' A type of hardboard invented by William H. Mason. It is formed using wooden chips, blasting them into long fibers with steam and then forming them into boards. The boards are then pressed and heated to form the finished boards. No glue or other material is added. The long fibers give Masonite a high bending strength, tensile strength, density and stability. Unlike other composite wood panels produced using formaldehyde-based resins to bind fibers, Masonite is made using natural ingredients only, which makes it an environmentally friendly product.

* '''Mode:''' A scale system that precedes the modern &quot;major-minor&quot; system. Used extensively by medieval composers (Gregorian chant being the most well-known example). Two of the &quot;Church modes&quot; went on to form the basis of our &quot;major-minor&quot; system: Ionian and Aeolian. 

* '''Neck:''' The long piece of wood that extends from the body to headstock that the guitar strings are tensioned across and which has the fretboard. Thus allowing the guitarist to shorten (fret) the open strings to produce a higher pitch.

* '''Note:''' A standardized measurement of an increase in pitch. Notes are described as being sharp or flat in relation to how higher or lower they are in relation to the accepted method of tuning.

* '''Octave:''' It is the note that a ''scale'' starts and ends on. Octaves occur at double or half a given frequency. If you press down any string at the twelfth fret, you are halving the string, so the string will play an octave higher.

* '''Pentatonic scale:''' A scale that uses five notes that is found in most cultures world-wide and is considered to be of ancient origin. In the modern &quot;major-minor&quot; system is considered as either a natural minor scale or major scale with the second and sixth omitted.

* '''Pick-up:''' A magnetic coil that detects the string vibration on an electric guitar. There are two main kinds, single-coil and humbuckers.

* '''Pick:''' A piece of plastic or metal used to hit the strings. Also referred to as a plectrum.

* '''Pitch:''' A measure of how high or low a sound is, which on the guitar is related to how fast or slow the string is vibrating. Shorter strings vibrate faster, and make higher notes.

* '''Root note:''' The term is usually used to describe the first note from which a chord is constructed. It is sometimes used to describe the first note of a scale.

* '''Scale:''' Derived from the Italian word &quot;scala&quot; meaning &quot;ladder&quot;. A sequential ordering of notes using set intervals that represents a tonal centre (key) or quality.

* '''Semitone:''' The smallest interval in music. The chromatic scale that contains all the available notes in western music contains twelve semitones. 

* '''Shergold Guitars:''' (or Shergold Woodcrafts Limited) Guitar manufacturer. Established in October 1967 by former Burns of London employees Jack Golder and Norman Houlder. Based in East London, the company moved from Forest Gate to Harold Wood in 1973.

* '''Tonic:''' The name of the first note of a scale. It may also refer to the chord built on the first note of the scale. 

* '''Tone:''' A general term to refer to the texture, colour or mood of a particular sound. For instruments it specifically refers to the general qualities of the sound produced.

* '''Tone (alternate):''' A measurement between one note and another note, consisting of two semitones. On the guitar it is measured by two frets.

* '''Tremolo bar:''' An alternative name for a vibrato bar. This was popularized by Leo Fender, who misnamed it when it was invented.

* '''Tuner:''' An electronic tuning aid for guitarists. It shows the frequency in hertz of a struck string using a display especially designed for guitar string frequencies; thereby allowing the guitarist to lower or higher the pitch of the string until the correct frequency for each string is achieved. 

*'''Whammy bar:''' Another name for a vibrato bar.
* '''Vibrato bar:''' A device on electric guitars that allows you to quickly lower and raise the pitch of your strings, thereby allowing you to move the tone up and down as you wish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A knowledge of chord progressions will help you communicate and play with other musicians. It is a ''must'' for participating in any kind of jam session. Knowing the most commonly used chord progressions and forms allows for greater enjoyment and unity when playing with other musicians.

Most songs use three or more chords though some songs exist that only use two chords. Often musicians will embellish chords by adding or removing notes and to provide further interest may vary the rhythm. One chord &quot;structures&quot; are uncommon but they do exist. For instance, Frere Jacques is a one-chord song because it can be played against a single major chord. The melody &quot;Taps&quot;, traditionally used at American military funerals, and which is very evocative, consists only of the notes which comprise the C-major chord (C, E, G).  One chord songs are rare on guitar.


==The I-IV-V ==
The most common chord progression is the I-IV-V. Note that Roman Numerals are used to describe these chord progressions. Many songs use only these three chords. If one views chords as a set of balancing scales with the root note and octave root at opposing ends it will be noted that the IV and V chords are at equal distance respectively to the root and octave root. Take for example the key of C major:

'''C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C'''

You will see that the G note (or chord) is a fifth above the root note. The note F is a fifth below the octave. This movement of a fifth is very pleasing to the human ear in its sense of balance and cohesion in relation to the root note. Another way to view chord progressions is that of a journey. In the sense that the root (or tonic) chord is the starting point and the octave root is at the end. All other points (chords) provide interest and variation with the fourth and the fifth chord occupying a special place on the journey due to them being half-way.

Many chord progressions start at the tonic (I), moves away to somewhere else, only to come back to the tonic. You can play this progression with major chords or you can substitute minor chords for the IV or V.

===Applying the I-IV-V===
This progression is pretty much the backbone of popular western music. Eddie Cochran, Muddy Waters and Buddy Holly are three artists who have used this progression extensively with great effect. Note that this chord progression uses a V7 chord. A V7 chord is just a V chord with an extra note. It is so common a device that when learning a chord progression many guitarist will play it through a few times using I-IV-V (normal V chord with no extra note) and then will play the chord progression I-IV-V7 a few times before switching back to the normal I-IV-V.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

==The I-vi-IV-V==
When picked with triplets, this progression is most commonly recognized from rock ballads in the 1980s, but it is widely used in many other styles of music. This progression is commonly referred to as the 50's progression, because it was common to many of the popular songs of the 1950's, notably &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. Here's the progression in the key of G major.

File: D major chord for guitar (open).png|'''D major (V)'''


&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

==The I-V-I-I==
This is a popular progression at the beginning of a much larger line, and can be combined with many other scale degrees.

==The ii-V-I==

As its name indicates, the progression is: ii-min7, V7 and Imaj7.

File:C major 7 chord for guitar (third fret bar).png|'''Cmaj7 (I)'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

Alternatively you can change the chord type on the II, and alter the voicing of the V. Some examples are:
* ii-m7b5(9) V7alt Imaj7

===Applying the ii-V-I===
ii-V-Is can be chained together, creating complex progressions. Here's an example:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File:C major chord for guitar (3rd fret bar).png|'''C major (I)'''
File:Bm7b5 chord for guitar (open position in first inversion).png|'''Bm7b5 (ii)'''
File:E7 chord for guitar (open with no fifth).png|'''E7 (V)'''
File:Am7 chord for guitar (open with doubled seventh).png|'''Am7 (I)'''
File:Dm7 chord for guitar (open).png|'''Dm7 (ii)'''
File:G7 chord for guitar (third fret barre with seventh on D string).png|'''G7 (V)'''
File:C major 7 chord for guitar (third fret bar).png|'''C maj7 (I)'''


&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
  C      Bm7b5 E7   (I     ii  V)
  Am7    Dm7   G7   (I     ii  V)
  C      (etc...)   (I     etc..)
&lt;/font&gt;
An example of complicated progression that can be created this way is the [[w:Coltrane changes|&quot;Coltrane Changes&quot;]], where the &quot;I&quot; chords move by Major 3rd intervals. Here's a simple example:
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
  Dm7  G7  Cmaj7    (ii V I  )
  F#m7 B7  Emaj7    (ii V I  )
  Bbm7 Eb7 Abmaj7   (ii V I  )
  Dm7  etc...       (I etc...)
&lt;/font&gt;
The way the ii-V-I progression works is first that it moves by 4ths upwards, which very often produces interesting results, and the 7th goes down a half tone below and becomes the following chord's 3rd.

==The Minor ii-V-i==
Another commonly used chord progression is the minor ii-V-i. One can derive this from the melodic minor scales shown above, while substituting a IminMaj7 for the IMaj7 chord, or by using three [[wikipedia:modes|modes]] from one [[wikipedia:harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]] , which produces the following chord progression:

      <comment>/* Comparison Operators */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PBASIC/Page}}

== Comparison Operators ==

A computer processor, such as the BasicStamp is capable of comparing two numbers and testing their relationship. The BasicStamp can compare two numbers and determine if they are equal, not equal, greater than, or less than. We can use special comparison operators to ask the BasicStamp to compare numbers.

;Equal:To determine if two numbers are equal, we use the &quot;=&quot; operator.
;Not Equal: To determine if two numbers are not equal, we use the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator.
;Greater Than: To determine if one number is greater than the other, we use the &quot;&gt;&quot; operator.
;Greater Than or Equal:To determine if one number is greater than ''or equal to'' another number, we use the &quot;&gt;=&quot; operator.
;Less Than: We can use the &quot;&lt;&quot; operator to determine if one number is less than the other.
;Less Than or Equal:We can use the &quot;&lt;=&quot; operator to determine if one number is less than ''or equal to'' another number.

== IF / THEN Branches ==

Once we compare two numbers, we can ask the BasicStamp to take action depending on that comparison. Using the IF / THEN structure, we can perform a jump if the condition is true, and we will not jump if the condition is false. The format of the instruction is:

 IF [Condition] THEN [Label]

Where [Condition is a comparison of two values (two variables or a variable and a constant, for instance). If the comparison is true, then the control flow jumps to the [Label].

== IF / THEN / Else Structures ==

Sometimes we want to have a second option. for instance, we want to do one thing if the comparison is true, and we want to do a different thing if the comparison is false. Here is an example, using a single IF / THEN branch, and GOTOs:

 IF [Condition] THEN GoTrue
   ... 'Do this if the condition is false
   GOTO EndBranch
 GoTrue:
   ... 'Do this if the condition is true
   GOTO EndBranch
 EndBranch:

Only one set of code in this case will be executed, depending on whether the condition is true or false. There are other ways to arrange this, of course.

== Simple Loops ==

We can use GOTO to create a simple infinite loop. The program will repeat the code in the middle of the loop forver:

 LoopTop:
   ... 'Do this infinitely
 GOTO LoopTop

We can use IF / THEN branches to create more advanced loops as well. However, most of the advanced loops that we can create can be made in a better way. We will discuss more advanced loops in the next chapter.</text>

      <comment>/* Nested Loops */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PBASIC/Page}}

== Looping ==

There are times when we want to repeat a certain portion of code several times. For small numbers of repeats, we could use something simple like Copy + Paste in our editor. However if we want to repeat an action many times, or even if we want to repeat infinitely, we need to use special techniques called '''loops'''. Using our GOTO function we have already seen a basic type of loop, but there are other types of loops that we can use. In some cases there are many ways to perform the same task.

== Infinite Loops ==

We have already seen a simple loop using the GOTO function. Here is a good example:

 LoopTop:
    ... 'code to repeat goes here
 GOTO LoopTop

Instead of having to create a new label and then jump to it, we can use a specialized structure called DO / LOOP that performs the same task, but is easier for people to read and understand.

=== DO / LOOP ===

A DO / LOOP structure is an infinite loop, but it doesnt require us to create a label. To use a DO / LOOP, we write:

 DO
    ... 'code to repeat goes here
 LOOP

== FOR / NEXT ==

If we have a certain piece of code that we want to repeat a finite number of times, we can't use an infinite loop, we need to use a '''counter variable''' to count the number of loops. We have already seen a basic implementation of this concept in the chapter on branches, but now we are going to look at a better structure for this, the FOR / NEXT loop. A FOR / NEXT loop allows us to do several things in a very simple and clean way:
#Initialize our counter variable
#Increment our counter variable every loop
#Check the counter variable to see if it has reached a final value. If it has reached  the final value we exit the loop.

A FOR / NEXT loop looks like this:

 FOR MyCounter = 0 TO 10
    ... 'code here will be repeated 11 times
 NEXT

== Nested Loops ==

We can put one loop inside another loop. This is useful for many complicated programs that need to repeat sets of loops. Loops that are inside other loops are called '''nested loops'''. Also, the outer-most loop is typically called the ''parent'' loop, and the inside loops are called the ''child'' loops. Each child loop must have a different counter variable from it's parent loop, or the system will not work correctly.</text>

      <comment>/* Readability */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PBASIC/Page}}

== Reusing Code ==

We have seen in our chapters on loops that there are many times that we want to repeat certain blocks of code multiple times. A loop repeats these blocks one after the other, but what if we want to repeat a block of code at different times?

We can use a special tool called a '''subroutine''' to make a block of code repeatable. We can &quot;call&quot; our subroutine at any point in our program, and when the subroutine ends, the control flow will jump back to where it was.

When we move control flow into a subroutine, we say that we &quot;call&quot; the subroutine, or that we &quot;enter&quot; it. Similarly, when the subroutine has completed, we say that we &quot;exit&quot; the subroutine, or that we &quot;return from it&quot;.

== GOSUB and RETURN ==

Subroutines start with a label. Instead of using a GOTO jump, we use the GOSUB instruction to enter the subroutine. The GOSUB does two things:
#it jumps to the subroutine's label, like a regular GOTO
#it stores the old value of the instruction pointer, so that after the subroutine the control flow can return to where it was. 
The second point is important, because it allows us to return to our previous position. 

The RETURN instruction, at the end of the subroutine, loads the saved value of the instruction pointer.

== Subroutines ==

A basic subroutine looks like this:

 MySubroutine:
    ... 'Do this in the subroutine
 RETURN

== Readability ==

One of the big benefits to using subroutines is that they help to make your code much easier to read for other people. Many times the person who writes a program will understand it very well, but it may not be so obvious to other people, such as teammates. For instance, if we have a robot using the BasicStamp, and we want to make that robot walk around in the shape of a square, we can use subroutines to do it easily:

 GOSUB MoveForward
 GOSUB TurnRight
 GOSUB MoveForward
 GOSUB TurnRight
 GOSUB MoveForward
 GOSUB TurnRight
 GOSUB MoveForward
 GOSUB TurnRight

Or, we can combine our subroutines with a loop to make it even easier:

 FOR MyCounter = 1 TO 4
    GOSUB MoveForward
    GOSUB TurnRight
 NEXT

The subroutines for &lt;code&gt;MoveForward&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TurnRight&lt;/code&gt; may be very complicated, but any person can read the small block of code above and understand what the robot will do.</text>

      <comment>/* Planning Your Training */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to Use This Book ==

This book is intended primarily as a manual for training retrievers for field sports.  As such, it contains many training plans, each associated with a particular training objective.  The training plans are presented in a series of chapters to provide organization for the material.

However, '''''this book does not present training plans in the order that training is to occur.'''''  Quite the contrary, a puppy is never too young to begin retrieving, yet the marked retrieve is one of the later chapters of this book.

What, then, is the correct sequence of training?  The answer is that the training cannot be done in a rigid sequence, for several reasons:

# It is essential that many of these skills be started as soon as possible.  Examples of cues that deserve immediate training are &quot;here&quot;, &quot;sit&quot;, and &quot;give it&quot;.
# During the dog's life, many of those same skills will need constant reinforcement.  If you train a particular skill and then do not practice it, you may find that it is not reliable when you need it, even though it was entirely reliable at one time.  But which skills need shoring up over the dog's life varies with the dog.  For example, a dog with a predisposition toward resource guarding may need continuous practice with a highly reinforcing &quot;give it&quot; his whole life.

No single sequence of training is right for all trainers and all dogs.  Eventually, your retriever will need to learn all of the skills presented in this book.  Therefore, the best plan is to begin working on a number of skills in parallel, one in one session and one in another, and continue to add more as you complete work in those previously started.

=== Getting Started ===

Begin by examining the table of contents (TOC) for the entire book.  A consolidated TOC is available at the top of the [[../Print Version | Print Version]] of this book.

At the minimum, you may also wish to click on particular topics and glance at the material to get a sense of the content.  Thoroughly study the material whenever you prefer to do so:

* Some readers prefer to read and digest the entire contents of a manual before starting work.
* Others prefer to defer thorough study of a particular topic until they are about to use the material.

=== Planning Your Training ===

Next comes the key to a solid training progression.  '''''As you organize each session, day, or week's training, review the TOC again.'''''  If an item catches your eye that you've never read before or for which you've forgotten some of the details, click the link and read the material for that topic as well.  Then you will have the information you need to plan your next segment of training.

By continually reviewing the TOC, you'll be able to maintain perspective of where you are in your dog's training, and to select the best project for you and your dog at all times.

Here's a general approach for choosing particular training projects:

* Limit your choices for each session to those training plans for which the dog is ready.  Information in each training plan, such as prequesites and sections on ''Extending the Behavior'', will help you make that determination.

* From among those plans for which the dog is ready, select the ones you deem most important at the time:

:— Perhaps you'll choose one that you feel deserves a higher history of reinforcement because of its importance in the dog's life, such as recall.

:— Or perhaps you'll choose one that is ready for more work because you've been concentrating on other areas.

:— Or one day you give a cue in the field and your dog doesn't respond correctly, perhaps too slow, perhaps not at all.  So you decide to dedicate an evening, or perhaps a week of evenings, to practicing that cue, perhaps adding the clicker and some high-value treats, to the re-training process.</text>

A computer program that doesn't communicate with the outside world is very boring indeed. Programs, including programs on our BasicStamp need to take '''input''' and generate '''output'''.

== INPUT and OUTPUT ==

The BasicStamp has 16 basic I/O pins, all of which can be used as either an input or an output. To specify that a pin is an input we use the INPUT command:

 INPUT 12

This makes pin 12 an input pin. To specify that a pin is being used as an output, the OUTPUT command can be used:

 OUTPUT 15

This makes pin 15 an output.

=== DIRS Register ===

The INPUT and OUTPUT commands affect a special memory value called DIRS. DIRS, which is short for &quot;Directions&quot; is a special memory location known as a &quot;Tri-State Buffer&quot;. DIRS contains 16 bits, each corresponding to one of the I/O ports. If the pin in DIRS is a 0, then the corresponding pin is an input. If the pin in DIRS is a 1, then the corresponding pin is an output.

For instance, if we wanted to set the top byte to be input, and the bottom byte to be output, we could write:

 DIRS = %1111111100000000

This is easier then having to write 16 INPUT and OUTPUT commands!

== I/O Ports ==

=== 1-Bit Ports ===

I/O ports have a special name, using the prefix &quot;In&quot; or &quot;Out&quot;, followed by the pin number. For instance, if we have a variable called MyVariable, and if all the ports were properly designated as INPUT or OUTPUT, we could write all of the following:

 MyVariable = IN3

 MyVariable = IN5 + 10

 OUT12 = MyVariable

 OUT15 = MyVariable - 10

=== Multi-Bit Ports ===

We can combine multiple I/O pins into multi-bit I/O ports. Each port has a specific name:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Direction !! Word !! Byte !! Nibble !! Bit
|-
|Input || INS || INL, INH || INA, INB, INC, IND || IN0 - IN15
|-
|Output || OUTS || OUTL, OUTH || OUTA, OUTB, OUTC, OUTD || OUT0 - OUT15
|}

The &quot;S&quot; suffix is used to denote the whole 16-bit word. &quot;L&quot; is for the low byte, &quot;H&quot; is for the high byte. &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are used for the 4 possible nibbles, with &quot;A&quot; being the lowest (pins 0 - 3) and &quot;D&quot; being the highest (pins 12 - 15).

== Sending and Receiving ==

When we want to send data from the BasicStamp to another device, we write that data to an output port. The external device that we are trying to communicate with will then read that value from an input port, and use that value internally. Data values to read and write from the BasicStamp are 5 volt values. Too much voltage will cause damage to the circuit, and too little voltage cannot be read. In general, we can associate our values for 1 and 0 with voltages:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Binary
! Voltage
|-
! 1 
| +5V
|-
! 0 
| 0V
|}

== &quot;Voltage?&quot; ==

We are going to digress from the main narrative of the book here for a minute and discuss some issues of electricity. Because of the embedded nature of the BasicStamp, most projects that involve them are going to also involve some manner of hardware integration. Improperly connecting your BasicStamp to external hardware can cause damage to the chip, and could even cause harm to you.

=== Ohm's Law ===

A basic law of electricity, and the only such law that we need to consider for the purposes of this book, is '''Ohm's Law'''. Ohm's law can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;v = iR&lt;/math&gt;

''v'' is the voltage, in volts. ''i'' is the current, in amps. ''R'' is the resistance, in Ohms. 

We know that the output port of the BasicStamp supplies 5V. If there is too much current, the stamp could get hot or even become damaged. We should try to keep our current to 5 milliamps or less (preferably less). This means, using Ohms's law that:

:&lt;math&gt;5 = (5\times10^{-3})R&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{5}{(5\times10^{-3})} = 1000 = 1k\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for every circuit we use with our BasicStamp, we should have at least 1000&amp;Omega; of resistance. Any less resistance and we risk damage to our BasicStamp.</text>

Hello, I have joined wikibooks to learn and help where possible.

I edit under the same name at the english wikipedia and commons. As of June 2007 I have started editing at Quote, Source and now here.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electromagnetics pertains to [[Electromagnetic Fields]], [[/Electromagnetic Waves/]], and various other electromagnetic constructs.

Please visit [[Electrodynamics]] for the time being as this is far less complete.

The intention is to arrange information primarily from wikipedia in a linear (book type) fashion with chapters where sections in the chapters are wikipedia articles such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mode Transverse modes]. In this way it can be used for a course. The current obstacle is how to allow these pages to be dynamically included such that updates to those pages are also updated in the book. To keep both updated manually results in a duplication of effort. It is possible that it will remain a compilation of ordered links and recommended readings, perhaps with the addition of sample problems.

Light, Microwaves, X-rays, Cosmic radiation, etc. are all electromagnetic phenomenon.

In the case of static fields each component can exist independantly meaning you can study [[Magnetostatics]] and [[FHSST_Physics_Electrostatics:Electrostatics|Electrostatics]] separately.

In the case of time varying fields they are inseparably linked meaning [[Electrodynamics]] also includes dynamic magnetic elements.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lutheran teaching can be summarized with the three Reformation solas.  Salvation is by God's grace alone (''sola gratia'') through faith alone (''sola fide'') for the sake of Jesus Christ's atoning death and ''without'' any merit on the part of those who are redeemed.  The Bible alone (''sola Scriptura'') is the sole norm and basis of all Christian doctrine and anything which is contrary to what Scripture teaches is not in accordance with God's Will

Historically, Lutherans trace themselves to Martin Luther, who was the founder of the Protestant Reformation.  In order to preserve the legacy and teaching of the Reformation, a group of pastors and theologians in Germany (where Luther lived) gathered together the three ecumenical creeds  as well as the key works of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon into the Lutheran Confessions (also known as the Book of Concord).  The Book of Concord is recognized as a faithful and true interpretation of the Bible and it is the symbol and body of doctrine for the Lutheran faith.  Contained in the Book of Concord are the [[w:Nicene Creed|Nicene Creed]], [[w:Apostles Creed|Apostles Creed]], [[w:Athanasian Creed|Athanasian Creed]], the unaltered [[w:Augsburg Confession|Augsburg Confession]], the [[w:Apology to the Augsburg Confession|Apology to the Augsburg Confession]], the [[w:Smalcald Articles|Smalcald Articles]], the [[w:Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope|Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]], [[w:Luther's Small Catechism|Luther's Small Catechism]], [[w:Luther's Large Catechism]] and the [[w:Formula of Concord|Formula of Concord]], all of which describe the doctrine and faith of the Lutheran Church.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:44, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi, I think there is a problem with the image you recently uploaded. You have copied it from a book stating that one of the authors has given you permission to use it under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. The book itself states that the copyright is held by The Benjamin / Cummings Publishing Company. If this copyright includes the image, and there is no indication that it doesn't, then the author probably can't re-license it this way. There is a procedure, although I can't find the link, for getting copyright clearance communicated to the Wiki projects where it isn't clear - I'm going to ask for advice when I find it. Meanwhile, I'm going to tag the image as having a copyright problem. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:36, 1 January 2009 (UTC)
:Okay, the URL you've given on the book page, as opposed to the image page, gives a suitable license. So, I'll update the URL on the image so this query doesn't get raised by anyone again. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:40, 1 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hyperbola &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. Ellipse &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{(a^2+b^2)} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

i. Show that ellipse &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has eccentricity &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{e}&lt;/math&gt; [1 mark]&lt;br/&gt;
ii. If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; intersect at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the first quadrant, show that the acute angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between the tangents to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha = \sqrt{2}(e + \tfrac{1}{e})&lt;/math&gt; [6 marks]

For part ii., here's my working:
#&lt;math&gt;P(a\sec\theta,b\tan\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;, from the definition of a hyperbola
#&lt;math&gt;P(\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\cos\theta,b\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, from the definition of an ellipse (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ellipse = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&lt;/math&gt;)
#&lt;math&gt;\therefore b\tan\theta = b\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta = \sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2}cos\theta = a\sec\theta&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = a&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;)
##&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2 = a^2&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;b^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Ted Tonks''''' is the father of [[../Nymphadora Tonks/]]

== Role in the Books ==

{{../../Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[../../Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

It is mentioned that [[../Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda Black]] was burned off the tapestry of the Black family tree because she married Ted Tonks, a Muggle (in fact, a Muggle-born wizard). This made Andromeda a blood traitor.

=== [[../../Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When [[../Harry Potter/]] has to leave [[../../Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys' house]] because the blood protection he received from his mother will end when he becomes of age, it is to Ted Tonks house that he will go first. He crashes on the grounds of the house, and Ted heals his injuries.

When [[../Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] follows Harry to [[../../Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], he is volunteering to travel with Harry, [[../Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[../Ron Weasley|Ron]], to give them any help he can. He says that he has left Tonks (which would be Nymphadora) with Ted and Andromeda. Harry sends him back to take care of Dora and their unborn child. 

Near the beginning of December, Harry, Hermione, and Ron hear a group of people who are traveling through the countryside, to escape the current Ministry edicts. Ted is among their number, and he passes on some information about the sword of Gryffindor.

Ron, when he returns to the group, brings a small wireless with him. This wireless will occasionally pick up a program called &quot;Potterwatch&quot;, a pirate signal that tells the true news of what is going on. The one program they receive, around the end of March, tells that Ted had been killed, along with two other members of the group that had been traveling with him.

&lt;!--{{JET:TOC}}--&gt;
Data can be added to tables using the &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; statement. The statement takes the following basic form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Insert Into {tablename}
    [In {external-db-path}]
    [{column-list}]
    [{select-statement} | {values-list}]
&lt;/source&gt;

{| class='wikitable'
| &lt;code&gt;{tablename}&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of an existing table into which rows will be inserted.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{external-db-path}&lt;/code&gt;
| A Windows path to an external database in which the target table resides. The external database can be another JET database, or any other database that the JET drivers can connect to (include dBase and Paradox databases).
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt;
| A comma-separated list of columns within a pair of parentheses, specifying which columns in the target table will be populated by the &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; statement. If omitted, then all columns will be populated by the &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; statement. Any column not specified by the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; will be set to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, unless the column has a default value set.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{select-statement}&lt;/code&gt;
| A &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; statement that returns the same number of columns as the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt;, or the number of columns in the target table if the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; is omitted.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{values-list}&lt;/code&gt;
| A comma-separated list of expressions within a pair of parentheses, providing the same number of values as there are columns in the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt;, or the number of columns in the target table if the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; is omitted.

Also having input to this field were the innovative team at the Mental Researh Institute in Palo Alto, California. Carry on the work of Don Jackson, the team of Fisch, Weakland, Waltzawick, Bodin et alia looked at communication in mental health issues. They came up with the 'Double Bind Theory' and the'Theory of Schizophrenia'. Their work in this field should not be overlooked.'''</text>

== Copying from Wikipedia ==

G'day Mike, great work you're doing on the Cookbook. Please note, however, that if you want to base a module on something out of Wikipedia, or another Wiki project, you should request an import so that we can maintain the edit histories for the information as required under our licensing provisions. I've tagged a couple of your new articles as being copy-and-paste imports for now, but you need to go back and list them on [[WB:RFI]] so that an admin can bring across the edit history. thanks, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:01, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

:Okay, I left a message on [[WB:RFI]].  However, I decided the arab-cuisine article is not suitable for the basis of a cookbook and so I have deleted all the content leaving only the title and indices.  I will start writing it from scratch. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] 16:20, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks, mate. I hope you don't mind, but I edited the listing a little to make it clearer to whoever does the import. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:29, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

== Fair use images ==

G'day Mike, when uploading images under the assumption of Fair Use, please tag them with the license tag {{tl|fair use}} instead of the two non-existent templates you've been using. I'd appreciate it if you could go back over the images you've uploaded and fix that; I've already done some, but you keep uploading more with the old tags. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:23, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

: Only with pleasure. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] 19:25, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks mate, much appreciated. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:22, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

== Image licensing ==

G'day Mike, you can specify the license on your images more specifically by selecting one of the tags from [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Image namespace|this page]]. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:08, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

:Hi Mike, thanks for the reply. I think there is only or maybe two without a fair use rationale. I'm only tagging them in the hope that some other kind soul will fix the rationale templates. They won't be deleted if they meet the fair use criteria. The tagging just provides a useful way of me finding them all again (i.e., providing a list of ones that need fixing) rather than a &quot;fix it in 7 days or be deleted&quot; warning.

Commonly known as Hellebores, the genus ''Helleborus'' is comprised of approximately 20 species (ongoing fieldwork may see this figure change) of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. The genus is native to much of Europe, from western Great Britain, Spain and Portugal, eastward across the Mediterranean region and central Europe into Romania and Ukraine, and along the north coast of Turkey into the Caucasus. The greatest concentration of species occurs in the Balkans. One atypical species (''H. thibetanus'') comes from western China; another atypical species (''H. vesicarius'') inhabits a small area on the border between Turkey and Syria.

Hellebores are toxic if ingested, causing tinnitus, vertigo, stupor, thirst, a feeling of suffocation, swelling of the tongue and throat, emesis and catharsis, bradycardia (slowing of the pulse), and finally collapse and death from cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hellebore|title=1911 Encyclopedia Brittanica, citing Codronchius (Comm.... de elleb., 1610), Castellus (De helleb. epist., 1622), Horace (Sat. ii. 3.80-83, Ep. ad Pis. 300).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The flowers have five &quot;petals&quot; (actually sepals or tepals) surrounding a ring of small, cup-like nectaries (petals modified to hold nectar). The sepals do not fall as petals would, but remain on the plant, sometimes for many months. Recent research in Spain suggests that the persistent calyx contributes to the development of the seeds (Herrera 2005).

==Growing conditions==
Hellebores grow best in shady locations with rich, well-drained soils. They do well in dry shade during the summer months.

==Species==
====Caulescent species====
These four species have leaves on their flowering stems (in ''[[../H. vesicarius/]]'' the stems die back each year; it also has basal leaves).
*''[[../Helleborus argutifolius/]]'' – '''Corsican hellebore'''
*''[[../Helleborus foetidus/]]'' – '''Stinking hellebore''' or '''Setterwort'''
*''[[../Helleborus lividus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus vesicarius/]]''

====Acaulescent (stemless) species====
These species have basal leaves. They have no true leaves on their flower stalks (although there are leafy bracts where the flower stalks branch).
*''[[../Helleborus atrorubens/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus croaticus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus cyclophyllus/]]'' 
*''[[../Helleborus dumetorum/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus abruzzicus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus liguricus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus bocconei/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus multifidus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus niger/]]'' – '''Christmas rose''' or '''Black hellebore'''
*''[[../Helleborus odorus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus orientalis/]]'' – '''Lenten rose''', '''Lenten hellebore''', '''oriental hellebore''' ('''''N.B.''''' most of the Lenten hellebores in gardens are now considered to be ''H.'' × ''hybridus''&lt;!-- NB for Editors: Please keep hybrid × signs outside inverted commas, otherwise they will appear italicised on certain browsers --&gt;)
*''[[../Helleborus purpurascens/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus thibetanus/]]'' (syn. ''H. chinensis'')
*''[[../Helleborus torquatus/]]''
*''[[../Helleborus viridis/]]'' - '''Green hellebore''' or '''Bear's-foot''' 
*''[[../Helleborus occidentalis/]]'' (formerly ''H. viridis'' subsp. ''occidentalis'')

Other species names (now considered invalid) may be encountered in older literature, including ''H. hyemalis'', ''H. polychromus'', ''H. ranunculinus'', ''H. trifolius''.

====Hellebore hybrids====
&lt;!-- NB for editors: Please keep hybrid × signs outside inverted commas, otherwise they will appear italicised on certain browsers --&gt;   
[[Image:Hellebore flowers.jpg|thumb|left|Hellebore species and hybrids: ''Helleborus viridis'' (top left); ''H. foetidus'' (top right) with cross-section; flowers of various specimens of ''H.'' × ''hybridus'', including doubles]]
[[Image:Hellebore flower - greenish white P.2005.04.04.jpg|thumb|right|A flower of ''H.'' × ''hybridus'' with olive-green nectaries visible behind the stamens]]
[[Image:Lenteroos rood plant.jpg|thumb|right|''H.'' × ''hybridus'' in a garden]]
Hybridising (deliberate and accidental) between ''H. orientalis'' and several other closely-related species and subspecies has vastly improved the colour-range of the flowers, which now extends from slate grey, near-black, deep purple and plum, through rich red and pinks to yellow, white and green. The outer surface of the sepals is often green-tinged, and as the flower ages it usually becomes greener inside and out; individual flowers often remain on the plant for a month or more. The inner surface of each sepal may be marked with veins, or dotted or blotched with pink, red or purple. &quot;Picotee&quot; flowers, whose pale-coloured sepals have narrow margins of a darker colour, are much sought-after, as are those with dark nectaries which contrast with the outer sepals.

Recent breeding programmes have also created double-flowered and anemone-centred plants. Ironically, doing this is actually reversing the evolutionary process in which hellebores' true petals had been modified into nectaries; it is usually these nectaries which become the extra petals in double, semi-double and anemone-centred flowers. 

Semi-double flowers have one or two extra rows of petals; doubles have more. Their inner petals are generally very like the outer ones in colour and patterning. They are often of a similar length and shape, though they may be slightly shorter and narrower, and some are attractively waved or ruffled. By contrast, anemone-centred flowers have, cupped within the five normal outer petals, a ring of much shorter, more curved extra petals (sometimes trumpet-shaped, intermediate in appearance between petals and nectaries), which may be a different colour from the outer petals. These short, extra petals (sometimes known as &quot;petaloids&quot;) drop off after the flower has been pollination, leaving an apparently single flower, whereas doubles and semi-doubles tend to retain their extra petals after pollination.

====Interspecific hybrids====
Gardeners and nurserymen have also created hybrids between less closely-related species. The earliest was probably ''H.'' × ''nigercors'', a cross between ''H. niger'' and ''H. argutifolius'' (formerly ''H. lividus'' subsp. ''corsicus'' or ''H. corsicus'', hence the name) first made in 1931. ''H.'' × ''sternii'', a cross between ''H. argutifolius'' and ''H. lividus'', first exhibited in 1947, is named after the celebrated British plantsman Sir Frederick Stern. ''H.'' × ''ballardiae'' (''H. niger'' crossed with ''H. lividus'') and ''H.'' × ''ericsmithii'' (''H. niger'' crossed with ''H.'' × ''sternii'') similarly commemorate the noted British nursery owners Helen Ballard and Eric Smith. In recent years, Ashwood Nurseries (of Kingswinford in the English Midlands), already well-known for its Ashwood Garden Hybrids (''H.'' × ''hybridus'' singles, semi-doubles, doubles and anemone-centres), has created interesting hybrids between ''H. niger'' and ''H. thibetanus'' (called ''H.'' 'Pink Ice'), and between ''H. niger'' and ''H. vesicarius'' (called ''H.'' 'Briar Rose'). The gardenworthiness of these hybrids has still to be proven.

==Uses==
Hellebores are widely grown in gardens for decorative purposes, as well as for their purported medicinal abilities and uses in witchcraft. They are particularly valued by gardeners for their winter and early spring flowering period; the plants are surprisingly frost-resistant and many are evergreen. Many species of hellebore have green or greenish-purple flowers and are of limited garden value, although Corsican hellebore (H. argutifolius), a robust plant with pale green, cup-shaped flowers and attractive leathery foliage, is widely grown. So is stinking hellebore or setterwort (H. foetidus), which has drooping clusters of small, pale green, bell-shaped flowers, often edged with maroon, which contrast delightfully with its dark evergreen foliage. H. foetidus 'Wester Flisk', with red-flushed flowers and flower stalks, is becoming popular, as are more recent selections with golden-yellow foliage.

The Christmas rose (H. niger) is a traditional cottage garden favourite, bearing pure white flowers (which often age to pink) in the depths of winter; large-flowered cultivars are available, as are pink-flowered and double-flowered selections.

The most popular hellebores for garden use, however, are undoubtedly H. orientalis and its colourful hybrids (H. × hybridus). They flower in early spring, around the period of Lent, and are often known as Lenten hellebores, oriental hellebores, or Lenten roses. They are excellent for bringing early colour to shady herbaceous borders and areas between deciduous shrubs and under trees.

==Maintenance==
Hellebores are easy to take care of, with the only maintenance required in early spring or summer, depending on the gardener’s preference.

In early spring, hellebores put up both their flowering stalks and their foliage. The previous year’s foliage tends to be rather unattractive by springtime, and can be removed (using pruners or scissors) without causing harm to the plant. Removing the previous year’s foliage will also help show off the flowers.

Hellebores are dormant during the summer months, and should be left alone. If the previous year’s foliage was not removed in the spring, it can be removed at any time. However, it is important to keep in mind that hellebores only put out new leaves in the spring, so severe cutbacks during the summer may cause harm to the plant.

Hellebores should not be cut back in the fall, as they continue to draw energy from their leaves over the winter. If the plant is covered by fallen tree leaves, these should be removed.

==Propagation==
Easily divides, but more commonly allowed to go to seed (most species self-sow freely). Propagated through tissue culture in commercial production.

==Harvesting==
For floral displays, the flowers can be cut individually, and allowed to float in a bowl of water. As they are frost hardy, the bowl can be kept outdoors as well as indoors, so long as the bowl will not crack in a hard freeze.

==Pests and diseases==
*'''Black Spot''' caused by ''Coniothyrium hellebori''
*'''Blight''' caused by ''Botrytis cinerarea'' and ''Gloeosporium'' sp.
*'''Crown Rot''' caused by ''Sclerotium delphinii''
*'''Winter Burn''' caused by a combination of harsh winter winds and sun.

== Tanks ==
Tanks are large, heavily armoured vehicles used for fighting. Tanks move on 'treads' which allow them to travel on almost any surface (except for water) and most tanks have a large cannon which are used to attack other vehicles, buildings and large groups of men. Most tanks also have a smaller machine gun for fighting against troops.

Tanks were first used by the British in World War I by the British, then later in the war by the Germans, French, and the Americans. However, tanks didn't play a big role in combat until World War II.

Tanks were able to cross [[wikijunior/World_War_II/Trenches|trench lines]] quickly, without taking much damage, as usually they were bulletproof. This was very useful as it allowed armies to move forward much more quickly. During the war however anti-tank traps were put in place to make tanks less effective.

== Use in Combat ==

During the beginning of the war tanks would accompany troops, being used solely as weapons to aid the ground troops. 

Towards the end of the war many tanks were being fitted with radios, allowing them to communicate with one-another and be able to go off on their own or in groups, without the ground troops to guide them. This allowed tanks to move much faster for they were no longer forced to move at the same speed as the walking troops.

Tanks were adapted to perform a variety of different jobs, from clearing minefields to fortifying/destroying roads and bridges.

World War II firmly cemented the tank in the military, proving that troops alone could no longer win wars.

== Nations ==

Most of the large nations involved in the war had tanks. The Germans used several different types of '''Panzers''' and '''Panthers'''. The Soviets generally used '''T-34s/T-35s'''. The British, American, French and Polish forces, along with other nations, also used tanks in combat.

== Project Locks ==

Talking with another Muggles' Guide user, the topic of the upcoming Harry Potter book (the final one) has come up and how its release might severely and negatively affect the book. Many users will likely rush to the book and add a lot of inappropriate and poorly developed content. Does anyone care to share ideas on how a book lockdown might work? I'd like to get a bot to lock all pages from anonymous users' editing for a few weeks around the book release. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:39, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:In the event that you needed to lock down the entire book, you should use the automatic cascading protection feature. Create a page, such as [[User:Withinfocus/Muggles Guide Pages]], or something similar, and create links to all the pages in the muggles guide book on that page. If you need to lock down the book, you go to protect your page, and select the option &quot;Cascading protection - protect any pages included in this page.&quot; This should quickly and immediately lock all the pages in the book. I don't know if it's as easy to unprotect them all, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:38, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::Why is it necessary to lock down this book?  This is Wikibooks and not a select club of people so let them contribute, help them and fix whatever language and formatting 'mistakes' they make.  Comments like &quot;Many users will likely rush to the book and add a lot of inappropriate and poorly developed content&quot; seem a little inappropriate and big-headed although I don't think you intended it to look that way.  We really need to be more welcoming to new users rather than trying to scare ghem away.

:::This is by far not going to be language and formatting mistakes. I am expecting a '''large''' number of vandalism edits to hit the book pages over several weeks. Wikipedia will surely experience this as well. If you peruse Wikipedia from time to time you may have also noticed some ideas regarding locking articles once they're sufficiently and professionally developed. Besides the topic of vandalism, keeping a work open forever has its positives and negatives and my book doesn't have the staff to comb through tons of edits. If a user would like to make a positive contribution to a page then I think it would be wise for them to create an account. This locking action would only be for anonymous users. You may not like this idea but at the same time I would expect you to understand the need for professionalism. The Muggles' Guide is very organized and I'd rather have edit waves like this managed with a little bit more quality control. This can be as simple as creating an account and establishing a real presence here. There are plenty of common or &quot;mistake&quot; pages we block or restrict here for anonymous users. I guess this issue might be something some people just fundamentally disagree with. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:46, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:I don't prefer this method. I'd much rather have a bot that sweeps the book's namespace. Based on past work with Herby on the book, I know this technically can be done but am interested in a tool that will accomplish it (or someone to make the action for me since I don't use bots). -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:34, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::I'm not really interested at all in creating or using a bot that can perform Admin tasks such as page protections. Something like that really should be put up for community discussion before we try to do it, because it is a departure from how Admin tools are currently employed. Considering that bots can be a touchy subject, it's much better (and will be much less hassle) to use the cascading protection option.
::Also, in response to Xania, Page protections are provided precisely for the reasons that a certain page is being misused. A millon newbie page tests will have the same effect as a concentrated vandalism attack. Protecting one page, or even a swath of related pages, will help to keep high-risk pages from going to hell. We don't protect pages to scare away users, we protect pages to protect content and prevent future problems. I see no reason why we couldn't page protect an entire book if the situation called for it. However, i will stipulate that it should likely be a very serious situation, and that the page protection should be very short-lived. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:42, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:::If I recall correctly there already exist bots that can perform this action.

::::Fair enough, I won't argue the point. I guess I don't understand the preference to using a bot over a cascading protection. A cascading protection can be done in one click, And should take effect immediately. A bot would have to go page-by-page, and in the worst case it could take several seconds to ''several minutes'' to perform all the page protections depending on the speed of your computer and the latency of the server. It would seem to me that for a truely critical situation the cascading protection would be more immediate and therefore more usefull. In terms of ease-of-use as well, the cascading protection is just one button click, and isn't going to be prone to the bugs and other nonsense that a bot could have.  It might just be me, but that really does seem like the better solution. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:01, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:::::Hope I'm not out of place here; I'm not an admin, but as the person who started this whole mess, it occurred to me that it might be useful for me to mention my thinking here. The thing is, we have had a lot of vandalism in the Muggle's Guide already, and we have dealt with it; but a lot of it has been people gratuitously posting spoilers in various places. With the release of the final book in the series, I think that we can expect to see a '''lot''' of posting of spoilers on the public pages of the project, and I was hoping to avoid a lot of that. The technique we use to protect the project does not matter; we have prior warning of the onset of this particular issue so the time it takes a bot to walk the list is immaterial. And this is a one-time thing, there will not be anything of this magnitude happening after this. Whatever people are more comfortable with, I think...

::::::OK I can see why protection may be necessary but I would prefer protection only to be used when we see that it is necessary and not pre-emptive.

:::::::Bot or cascade, both are fine really, it's just that the unlock will most likely need to be a bot action. I believe we have over 500 pages in the Muggles' Guide so automation is important. We can also wait to see if undesirable edits develop and withhold locking until then. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:23, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, I really think that we have to wait until a problem arises. We aren't really in the habit of protecting pages--especially book pages--without a clear and present reason. Now if there is a problem though, You can be certain that there will be plenty of help if you need it. I'll look around for bots that can protect/unprotect the pages ''just in case a better solution cannot be found''. Also, considering that no books have ever been mass-protected before, We should definitely err on the side of caution with this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:11, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:::::Two things to consider as well: first, once the edits have started, it is entirely possible that at least some pages will be edited to be no longer in the Muggles' Guide category. It's easier for a vandal to do that – edit, Ctrl-A, start typing – than it is to retain the category. And second, a lot of the concerned editors may well be off line during the danger period – I know I will be, deliberately, because I want to read the ruddy thing myself.

(''reset tabs'') Well, vandalism ''may'' (and probably will) happen, but new contributors might come by too, and protecting the whole book isn't going to encourage them. HerbyThyme might or might not be around for the onslaught (RealLife stuff for him), but Xania is on Italian time, Az_1568 is on Pacific time, and Whiteknight is around a lot these days too (I'm around from 4-6 AM EDT, and whenever it happens to be raining (like it is at the moment)). We are, thankfully, not short-staffed admin-wise any longer though more would be merrier. Protecting an entire book -- '''particularly''' a book that intellegent young people might want to help write -- is  not a good way to ensure the long-term health of our project (some of those young Harry Potter fans might later help write textbooks for particle physics or automotive repair). The best defense against vandals is to make sure that ''all'' of our trusted users have admin tools so that they can use them when they need them (hint, hint, Chazz and Webaware!), rather than needing to hope that some other admin will happen to be around when there's trouble (this is a wiki, after all... we're supposed to fix problems when we see them). --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:51, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:Don't have time right now for picking up admin responsibilities, but will gladly add the Muggle's guide cat to my RC rounds when it pops up in July and will watch the full RC from time to time (as I do now). But Chazz has a valid point, it will take extreme vigilance to keep a lid on this if a squillion new anon editors descend on the book, and &quot;defences&quot; are effectively just &quot;clean up after the marauding hordes&quot;. In every other sphere (health, work safety, military, software design, manufacturing, driving, etc.) prevention is preferable to repair - so why can't we apply that here, just short term until the madness passes?

::The only &quot;responsibility&quot; here is to just block an account or IP that you notice actively vandalizing while doing RC patrolling... it's just 3 buttons, not a wedding vow :). 
::The problem with protecting the book for that reason is that with those 100 vandals that will be attracted by the attention, there will also almost certainly be a few earnest new contributors, and our protection tool can't block anons without also blocking new accounts (hence the problems new editors have with adding things to bookshelf templates). Every book, wiki, etc. will be vandalized from time to time. When something's in the news, there will be more vandals. But when something's in the news there will also be new users interested in contributing. We have to just deal with vandalism, but we can't thrive without new contributors. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:33, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
:I think we (as a community) should create the page of all Muggles Guide pages in advance in anticipation that protecting the whole thing may be necessary on the 21st. Also we should gather a group of admins to watch the guide closely between mid July and mid August. I will be available in July to help. I also think that this is a tremendous opportunity for the Muggles guide to get some new contributors (and possibly attract some attention to Wikibooks as well.) I think those of us with interest and knowledge should all think about pitching in on the Muggles Guide in the upcoming weeks to prepare it for the large number of visitors it might receive July 14th-28th. Maybe Chazz or &lt;strike&gt;Webaware&lt;/strike&gt; withinfocus could create/point us to a to-do list and organize a barn-raising of sorts. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:04, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

I do hope that we can get some new editors and get a new bunch of content additions going. The entire book is basically outlined and all editors have to do is edit existing pages in their respective sections. There's a lot of structure to the book and so as long as people don't bust out new content (which should be relatively small if anything) we'll be running smoothly. If someone would like to be creative with some sort of Harry Potter template to post on the pages that would be awesome.

:Yes, I'm wittering on about project locks again... I just finished reading the RfD for the plot detail of book 6 over on Wikipedia, and one of the things that came up there was that the timing of the appearance of the summary was bad: it appeared immediately after the book itself came out, and so could be seen as copyvio: by publishing a detail summary so soon, there was the appearance of trying to cut into book sales by providing a free equivalent.

== &quot;Wikiversity:&quot; Namespace ==

Not many people might be aware of this, but the pages from the &quot;Wikiversity:&quot; namespace were not deleted when the interwiki prefix for wikiversity was created. All the pages in that namespace, including some pages that were used in conjunction with our books, were essentially lost because they could not be reached by the system.

Well, all that has now been fixed, and all the &quot;lost&quot; pages are now found. All the pages that were in the &quot;wikiversity:&quot; namespace have been renamed to start with &quot;Wikiversity-&quot; instead. You can find a complete list of these pages at [[Special:Prefixindex/Wikiversity-]]. What we need to do is go through these pages, determine if any information in them is salvagable (like it can be used here by our books, or if it still needs to be moved to wikiversity), and possibly delete pages that aren't being used. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:10, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

== Focus on Heterosexual relationships ==

I'd suggest that at least cursory mention of &quot;gay/lesbian&quot; relationships be included, and preferably a &quot;how men select men&quot; and &quot;how women select women&quot; section be added alongside their Heterosexual counterparts. [[User:Riffraffselbow|Riffraffselbow]] ([[User talk:Riffraffselbow|talk]]) 03:20, 3 October 2009 (UTC)

:Creating the missing sections can be requested but not enforced. A solution would be to restrict the scope of the book to cover only Heterosexual relationships this can be done by a rename of the work. Would you (or anyone else) be willing to provide the missing content ? Would you be satisfied by a renaming of the book ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:47, 23 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Good Samaritan Laws==
{{FA Best Practice|All rescuers should not be afraid of liability affecting them whilst performing their duties. In many cases, it is often best to provide care and to do so to the best of your ability without worry of legal implications.}}
'''Good Samaritan laws''' in the United States and Canada are laws that reduce the liability to those who choose to aid others who are injured or ill, though it does not protect you from being sued, it just significantly reduces your liability. Ontario's [http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/2001c.2/20071015/whole.html ''Good Samaritan Act''] is one example of such legislation. They are intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. In other countries (as well as the Canadian province of Quebec), Good Samaritan laws describe a legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress, unless doing so would put themselves in harm's way. Citizens are often required to, at minimum, call the local emergency number.

''Check with your government for applicable legislation in your area.'' Typically, the Good Samaritan legislation does not cover an individual who exceeds their training level or scope of practice; nor would you be protected against gross negligence.

===General guidelines===
#Unless a caretaker relationship (such as a parent-child or doctor-patient relationship) exists prior to the illness or injury, or the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; is responsible for the existence of the illness or injury, no person is required to give aid of any sort to a victim.
#Any first aid provided must not be in exchange for any reward or financial compensation. As a result, medical professionals are typically '''not''' protected by Good Samaritan laws when performing first aid in connection with their employment.
#If aid begins, the responder must not leave the scene until:
#*It is necessary in order to call for needed medical assistance.
#*Somebody of equal or higher ability can take over.
#*Continuing to give aid is unsafe (this can be as simple as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens) — a responder can '''never''' be forced to put himself or herself in danger to aid another person.
#The responder is not legally liable for the death, disfigurement or disability of the victim as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith, and in accordance with their level of training.

===Negligence===
Negligence requires three elements to be proven:
;Duty of care
:You had a duty to care for the victim
:Often, if you begin first aid, then a duty of care exists
;Standard of care was not met
:You didn't perform first aid properly, or went beyond your level of training
:The standard of care is what a reasonable person with similar training would do in similar circumstances
;Causation
:The damages caused were your fault
:Causation requires proof that your act or omission caused the damages

==Assisting with Medications==
Assisting with medications can be a vital component during a medical emergency.  Assisting with medications includes helping the victim locate the medication, taking the cap off of a bottle of pills, and reading the label to ensure that the victim is going to take the right medication.  Assisting, however, ''does not'' imply actually administering the medication -- this is an advanced level skill, which, if done, may open you up to liability from going beyond your level of training.  However, by assisting, you may be able to help the victim find their medications more quickly, resulting in an improved outcome.

{{mergeto|First Aid/Automated External Defibrillation}}
[[Image:AED open cutout.jpg|thumb|An automated external defibrillator, open and ready for pads to be attached]]
An Automated External Defibrillator or AED is a portable electronic device that automatically  diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient,&lt;ref name=AHA1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/6/1677|title=Automatic External Defibrillators for Public Access Defibrillation|last=Kerber|first=Richard E|coauthors=Becker, Lance B; Bourland, Joseph D; Cummins, Richard O; Hallstrom, Alfred P; Michos, Mary B; Nichol, Graham; Ornato, Joseph P; Thies, William H; White, Roger D; Zuckerman, Bram D|date=1997|volume=95|issue=1677-1682|journal=Circulation|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is able to treat them by application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.  

AEDs are designed to be simple to use for the layman, and the use of AEDs is taught in many first aid, first responder and basic life support (BLS) level CPR classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Red Cross|url=http://www.redcross.org/services/hss/courses/adultcpraed.html|accessdate=2007-06-28|title=CPR Adult Courses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
An automated external defibrillator is used in cases of life threatening cardiac arrhythmias, which may lead, or have lead to cardiac arrest.  The rhythms the device will treat is usually limited to:
*Ventricular fibrillation (shortened to VF or V-Fib)
*Pulseless Ventricular tachycardia (shortened to VT or V-Tach)&lt;ref name=AHA1/&gt;

AEDs (and all other defibrillators) are not designed to shock asystole or 'flat line' patterns, as this will not have a positive clinical outcome.  The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out by any lay rescuer prior to the arrival of a defibrillator. 

In each of the two types of shockable cardiac arrhythmia, the heart is in activity (possibly even beating), yet in an unusual pattern, which can be life-threatening if left uncorrected. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Frequently, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation.  The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach Asystole, with an absence of any rhythm.

Uncorrected, these cardiac conditions rapidly lead to irreversible brain damage and death. After approximately three minutes, irreversible brain/tissue damage occurs. For every minute that a person in cardiac arrest goes without being successfully treated (by defibrillation), the chance of survival decreases by 10 percent.

AED's are designed to be used by laypersons, who ideally should have received specialist training.  They are usually limited in their interventions to delivering high joule shocks for VF and VT.  This is in contrast to more sophisticated manual and semi-automatic defibrillators used by health professionals, which can act as a pacemaker if the heart rate is too slow (bradycardia) and perform other functions which require a skilled operator, able to read electrocardiograms.

==Placement==
[[Image:AED_Oimachi_06z1399sv.jpg|thumb|An AED at a railway station in Japan. The AED box has information on how to use it in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean, and station staff are trained to use it.]]
Automated external defibrillators are generally either held by trained personnel who will attend incidents, or are '''public access''' units which can be found in places including corporate and government offices, shopping centers, airports, restaurants, casinos, hotels, sports stadiums, schools and universities, community centers, fitness centers and health clubs.  

The locating of a public access AED should take in to account where large groups of people gather, and the risk category associated with these people, to ascertain whether the risk of a sudden cardiac arrest incident is high.  For example, a centre for teenage children is a particularly low risk category (as children very rarely enter heart rhythms such as VF or VT, being generally young and fit, and the most common cause of paediatric cardiac arrest is trauma - where an AED is no use), whereas a large office building with a high ratio of males over 50 is a very high risk environment.

In many areas, emergency services vehicles are likely to carry AEDs, with some Ambulances carrying an AED in addition to a manual unit.  In addition, some police or fire service vehicles carry an AED for first responder use.  Some areas have dedicated community first responders, who are volunteers tasking with keeping an AED and taking it to any victims in their area.  It is also increasingly common to find AEDs on transport such as commercial airlines and cruise ships.

In order to make them highly visible, public access AEDs often are brightly coloured, and are mounted in protective cases near the entrance of a building. When these protective cases are opened, and the defibrillator removed, some will sound a buzzer to alert nearby staff to their removal but do not necessarily summon emergency services.  All trained AED operators should also know to phone for an Ambulance when sending for or using an AED, as the patient will be unconscious, which always requires ambulance attendance.
[[Image:AED at Centrair.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An AED at Chūbu Centrair International Airport in Aichi, Japan.]]

A trend now being seen is the purchase of AEDs to be kept and used in the home, particularly by those with known existing heart conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heartstarthome.com/content/why_defibrillators/why_defibs2_detail.asp|title=Heartstart Home Defibrillator|publisher=Philips Electronics|accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of devices in the community has grown as prices have fallen to affordable levels (in line with a large television).  There has been some concern amongst medical professionals that these home users do not necessarily have appropriate training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/business/03jolt.html?ei=5088&amp;en=84d7afacd0fd7943&amp;ex=1272772800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position=|title=Do It Yourself: The Home Heart Defibrillator|last=Barnaby|First=Barnaby J|date = 3rd May 2005|accessdate=2007-06-15|publication=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many advocate the more widespread use of community responders, who can be appropriately trained and managed.

Typically, an AED kit will contain a face shield, for providing a barrier between patient and first aider during rescue breathing; a pair of Nitrile rubber non-allergenic gloves; a pair of Tuff cuts scissors, for cutting through a patient's clothing to expose the chest; a small towel for wiping away any moisture on the chest and a razor for shaving those with very hairy chests.

==Preparation for operation==
[[Image:Defib Checks.jpg|thumb|right|The use of easily visible status indicator and pad expiry date on one model of AED]]
Most manufacturers recommend checking the AED before every 'duty' or on a regular basis if a fixed unit.  Some units need to be switched on in order to perform its self check.  Other models, such as the one pictured, have a self check system built in, with a visible indicator.

All manufacturers mark their pads with an expiry date, and it is important to ensure that the pads are in date.  This is usually marked on the outside of the pads.  Some models are designed to make this date visible through a 'window', although others will require the opening of the case to find the date stamp.

==Mechanism of operation==
An AED is called ''external'' because the operator applies the electrode pads to the bare chest of the victim, as opposed to internal defibrillators, which have electrodes surgically implanted inside the body of a patient.

The 'Automatic' part of the title refers to the unit's ability to autonomously analyse the patient's condition, and to assist this, the vast majority of units have spoken prompts, and some may also have visual displays to instruct the user.

 
When turned on, or opened, the AED will instruct the user to connect the electrodes (pads) to the patient.  Once the pads are attached to the patient, everyone should avoid touching the victim so as to avoid false readings by the unit.  The pads allow the AED to examine the electrical output from the heart and determines if the patient is in a viable, shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia).  If the device determines that a shock is viable, it will use the battery to charge it's internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock. This system is not only safer (charging only when required), but also allows for a faster delivery of the electrical current.

When charged, the device instructs the user to ensure no one is touching the victim and then to press a button to deliver the shock.  Human intervention is usually required to deliver the shock to the patient, to avoid the possibility of accidents.  After the shock is delivered, the device will either instruct the user to commence CPR, or will continue to monitor the heart rhythm of the patient to determine if another shock is necessary. 

Many AED units have an 'event memory', which store the ECG of the patient along with details of the time the unit was activated and the number and strength of any shocks delivered.  Some units also have voice recording facilities, to monitor the actions taken by the personnel, to ascertain if these had any impact on the survival outcome.  All this memorised data can be either downloaded to a computer, or printed out, so that the providing organisation, or responsible body (such as a coroner) can see the effectiveness of both CPR and defibrillation on the patients heart. 

AEDs available to the public may be semi-automatic or fully automatic. Fully automatic units are likely to have few buttons, often activating as soon as the case is opened, and possibly just one button to shock, or in some cases, this will be performed automatically.  The user has no input in to the operation of the unit, apart from attaching the pads, and following the prompts.  Health care professionals, and other trained persons, may use a Semi-Automatic defibrillator, which is likely to have an ECG readout display, and the possibility to override the rhythm analysis software.  This allows trained personnel to give a higher standard of care, shocking at specific times in the cycle.

The first commercially available AEDS were all of a monophasic type, which gave a high-energy shock, up to 360 to 400 joules depending on the model. This caused increased cardiac injury and in some cases second- and third-degree burns around the shock pad sites.  Newer AEDs (manufactured after late 2003) have tended to utilise biphasic algorithms which give two sequential lower-energy shocks of 120 - 200 joules, with each shock moving in an opposite polarity between the pads.  This lower-energy waveform has proven more effective in clinical tests, as well as offering a reduced rate of complications and reduced recovery time.

==Simplicity of use==
Unlike regular defibrillators, an automated external defibrillator requires very little training to use. It automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. Automatic models will administer the shock without the user's command. Semi-automatic models will tell the user that a shock is needed, but the user must tell the machine to do so, usually by pressing a button. In most circumstances, the user cannot override a &quot;no shock&quot; advisory by an AED. Some AEDs can even be used on children (those under 55 lbs &lt;nowiki&gt;[25 kg]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in weight, or under age 8). If a particular model of AED is approved for pediatric use, all that is required is the use of more appropriate pads. Some organizations, such as the American Heart Association, recommend that if pediatric AED pads are not available, adult pads should be used to determine if the child is in a shockable rhythm. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that a child, in a shockable cardiac arrest, can be &quot;hurt&quot; by an adult defibrillation energy setting. 

All AEDs approved for use in the United States] use a electronic voice to prompt users through each step. Because the user of an AED may be deaf or hard of hearing, many AEDs now include a screen to provide visual prompts. Most units today are designed for use by non-medical operators. Their ease of use has given rise to the notion of public access defibrillation (PAD), which experts agree has the potential to be the single greatest advance in the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest since the invention of CPR &lt;ref&gt;[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/102/suppl_1/I-1?ijkey=0ea84b1fa73ef72b72aef923e0f1adc6d4fd6ba5&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Introduction to the International Guidelines 2000 for CPR and ECC]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Liability==
Most health professionals agree that automated external defibrillators are so easy to use that most, if not all, states in the United States now include the &quot;good faith&quot; use of an AED by any person under the Good Samaritan laws. &quot;Good faith&quot; protection under a Good Samaritan law means that a first aid responder cannot be held civilly liable for the harm or death of a victim by providing improper or inadequate care, given that the harm or death was not intentional (and other certain circumstances). In the United States, Good Samaritan laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aed.htm State Laws on Heart Attacks, Cardiac Arrest &amp; Defibrillators]&lt;/ref&gt; provide protection for the use of AEDs by trained and untrained responders, to a point. Even for trained providers, AEDs provide little liability if used correctly, in fact even the NREMT-B and many state EMT and almost all CPR classes offered incorporate AED education as parts of their program. In addition to the Good Smaritan laws, Ontario in Canada also has the “Chase McEachern Act (Heart Defibrillator Civil Liability), 2007 (Bill 171 – Subsection N)” passed in June, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Source/Statutes/English/2007/S07010_e.htm Health System Improvement Act, 2007] Retrieved on 26 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation now protects individuals from liability for damages that may occur from their use of an AED to save someone’s life at the immediate scene of an emergency, unless damages are caused by gross negligence.

==Airway Management==
'''Airway management''' is the process of ensuring that:
# there is an open pathway between a patient’s lungs and the outside world, and
# the lungs are safe from aspiration

==Manual methods==
===Head tilt/Chin lift===
[[Image:Tongue-blocking-airways.png|thumb|The head-tilt chin-lift is the most reliable method of opening the airway.]]
The simplest way of ensuring an open airway in an unconscious patient is to use a head tilt chin lift technique, thereby lifting the tongue from the back of the throat.

===Jaw thrust===
ILCOR no longer advocates use of the jaw thrust, even for spinal-injured victims. Instead, continue use of the head-tilt chin-lift. If there is no risk of spinal injury, it is preferable to use the head-tilt chin-lift procedure which is easier to perform and maintain.

==Oral Airways==
[[Image:Canule de Goedel 2.jpg|thumb|Oropharyngeal airways come in a variety of sizes; measure from the angle of the chin (or earlobe) to the corner of the mouth.]]
There are a variety of artificial airways which can be used to keep a pathway between the lungs and mouth/nose.

An oropharyngeal airway can be used to prevent the tongue from blocking the airway.  When these airways are inserted properly, the rescuer does not need to manually open the airway. Aspiration of blood, vomitus, and other fluids can still occur.  

It is only possible to insert an oral airway when the patient is completely unconscious or does not have a gag reflex.  If the patient begins to gag after inserting the oral airway, remove it immediately.

===Use and contraindications===
The correct size is chosen by measuring against the patient's head (from the earlobe to the corner of the lips). The airway is then inserted into the patient's mouth upside down. Once contact is made with the back of the throat, the airway is rotated 180 degrees, allowing for easy insertion, and assuring that the tongue is secured. Measuring is very important, as the flared ends of the airway must rest securely against the lips to remain secure.

To remove the device, it is pulled out following the curvature of the tongue; no rotation is necessary.

The airway does not remove the need for the recovery position: it does not prevent suffocation by liquids (blood, saliva, food, cerebrospinal fluid) or the closing of the glottis.

The mains risks of its use are:
* if the patient has a gag-reflex they may vomit 
* when it is too large, it can close the glottis and thus close the airway
* improper sizing can cause bleeding in the airway
Correction: Airway is measured from the centre of the lips to the angle of the jaw. This is the international method as used by ambulance services.

===Nasopharyngeal Airways (NPA)===
In the case of an unconscious person who still possesses a gag reflex, the nasopharyngeal airway may be used to maintain an open airway. The airway can come and many different sizes and, since every person is unique, a different size will be used for each individual case.

The correct size is measured against the patient's head (from nostril to earlobe). The airway is inserted with the bevelled side towards the nostrils until the entire airway is inside the patient's nasal cavity. The airway should be well lubricated using a water-based lubricant prior to insertion. This will prevent any excessive damage of the nasal airway during insertion. Some minor bleeding may occur due to the breaking of nasal capillaries, however, as a result of the insertion of the airway, it is not life-threatening. 

===Contraindications===
*Severe spinal/head injuries (risk of pressurizing leaking cerebrospinal fluid or CSF)

==Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM)==
''See also: [[First Aid/Oxygen Administration#Bag-Valve-Mask|Oxygen Administration]]''

A '''bag valve mask''' (also known as a '''BVM''' or '''Ambu bag''', which is a brand name) is a hand-held device used to provide ventilation to a victim who is not breathing. The device is self fills with air, although it may be connected to an oxygen system.

Use of the BVM to ventilate a victim is frequently called &quot;bagging.&quot; Bagging is regularly necessary when the victim's breathing is insufficient or has ceased completely. The BVM is used in order to manually provide mechanical ventilation in preference to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (either direct or through an adjunct such as a pocket mask).

===Components===
[[Image:Ballon ventilation 1.jpg|thumb|300 px|A bag-valve-mask]]
The BVM consists of a flexible air chamber, about the size of an American football, attached to a face mask via a shutter valve. When the air chamber or &quot;bag&quot; is squeezed, the device forces air into the victim's lungs; when the bag is released, it self-inflates, drawing in ambient air or oxygen supplied from a tank. A bag valve mask can be used without being attached to an oxygen tank to provide air to the victim, but supplemental oxygen is recommended since it increases the amount of oxygen reaching the victim. Some devices also have a reservoir which can fill with oxygen while the patient is exhaling (a process which happens passively), in order to increase the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to the victim by about twofold. A BVM should have a valve which prevents the victim from rebreathing exhaled air and which can connect to tubing to allow oxygen to be provided through the mask.  

Bag valve masks come in different sizes to fit infants, children, and adults. Some types of the device are disposable, while others are designed to be cleaned, disinfected, and reused.

===Use===
The BVM directs the gas inside it via a one-way valve when compressed by a rescuer; the gas is then delivered through a mask and into the victim's airway and into the lungs. In order to be effective, a BVM must deliver between 700 and 1000 milliliters of air to the victim's lungs, but if oxygen is provided through the tubing and if the victim's chest rises with each inhalation (indicating that adequate amounts of air are reaching the lungs), 400 to 600 ml may still be adequate. Squeezing the bag once every 5 seconds for an adult or once every 3 seconds for an infant or child provides an adequate respiratory rate (12 respirations per minute in an adult and 20 per minute in a child or infant).

Professional rescuers are taught to ensure that the mask portion of the BVM is properly sealed around the patient's face (that is, to ensure proper &quot;mask seal&quot;); otherwise, air escapes from the mask and is not pushed into the lungs.  In order to maintain this seal, some protocols use a method of ventilation involving two rescuers: one rescuer to hold the mask to the patient's face with both hands and ensure a mask seal, while the other squeezes the bag. However, to make better use of available rescuers, the BVM can be operated by a single rescuer who holds the mask to the victim's face with one hand (using a C-grip), and squeezes the bag with the other.  

When using a BVM, as with other methods of ventilation, there is a risk of overinflating the lungs. This can lead to pressure damage to the lungs themselves, and can also cause air to enter the stomach, causing gastric distention which can make it more difficult to inflate the lungs and which can cause the victim to vomit. This can be avoided by care on behalf of the rescuer. Alternatively, some models of BVM are fitted with a valve which prevents overinflation, by blocking the outlet pipe when a certain pressure is reached, though they should all be able to be bypassed in a situation where more pressure is needed, such as in anaphylaxis.

==Suction Devices==

In the case of a victim who vomits or has other secretions in the airway, these techniques will not be enough. Suitably trained first aiders may use suction to clean out the airway, although this may not always be possible. A unconscious victim who is vomiting or has copious secretions in the mouth should be turned into the semi-prone position when there is no suction equipment available, as this allows (to a certain extent) the drainage of fluids out of the mouth instead of down the trachea.

[[Image:Deconference-2002-triage-tag.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Typical triage tag for professional use.]]
'''Triage''' is a system used by of rationing limited medical resources when the number of injured needing care exceeds the resources available to perform care so as to treat those patients in most need of treatment who are able to benefit first. The term comes from the French word for ''sort''.

== Simple Triage And Evacuation (START) ==

'''START''' is a simple triage system that first aiders can learn to use with little training. Simple triage identifies which persons need advanced medical care.  
In START, persons should be treated and evacuated as follows:

*'''DECEASED''' are left where they fell, covered if necessary; note that in START a person is not triaged &quot;DECEASED&quot; unless they are not breathing and pulseless and an effort to reposition their airway has been unsuccessful.

*'''IMMEDIATE''' or Priority 1 (red) evacuation by MEDEVAC if available or ambulance as they need advanced medical care at once or within 1 hour. These people are in critical condition and would die without immediate assistance.

*'''DELAYED''' or Priority 2 (yellow) can have their medical evacuation delayed until all IMMEDIATE  persons have been transported. These people are in stable condition but require medical assistance.

*'''MINOR''' or Priority 3 (green) are not evacuated until all IMMEDIATE and DELAYED persons have been evacuated.  These will not need advanced medical care for at least several hours.  Continue to re-triage in case their condition worsens. These people are able to walk, and may only require bandages and antiseptic.

== Overview ==

'''''Xenophilius Lovegood''''' is the father of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] and publisher of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Luna Lovegood tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] that her father is the publisher of ''The Quibbler'', but we do not meet him or learn his name.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Xenophilius attends the wedding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] wearing stunningly bright robes and a large device consisting of a triangle, with a  circle and line inscribed in it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], who is at the wedding, tells a disguised [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] that that symbol was used by the evil magician [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] for his movement.

Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Hermione, while they are on the run later, hear that ''The Quibbler'' is printing stories supportive of Harry. They go to visit Xenophilius; he seems reluctant to invite them in, but eventually does so, saying that he has to send an owl to fetch Luna, who is down past the bridge catching Plimpies for soup. Explaining that the symbol he had worn was the sigil of the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], he asks Hermione to read the story of the Three Brothers from her copy of ''the Tales of Beedle the Bard''. The three brothers receive items from Death, because they have tricked him: one asks for a wand more powerful than any other, one asks for a stone that can return people from death, and one asks for Death's own invisibility cloak. Xenophilius explains that these are the three Hallows, and the symbols of them are the triangle for the invisibility cloak, the circle for the resurrection stone, and the line for the wand.

Xenophilius then departs to make some soup, and Harry investigates an upstairs room, finding what is evidently Luna's room, with painted portraits of himself and other members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. He discovers that it has apparently not been used for some time, which is odd; Luna should be home for Christmas break. When Xenophilius returns, Harry asks him again where Luna is; the printing press, which has been making copies of the Quibbler all this time, suddenly spits an entire stack of papers over the floor, and Harry finds that the Quibbler has suddenly taken up the official [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] line, that Harry is &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot; and should be arrested.

Xenophilius admits that he has sent an owl to the Ministry; Luna is being held captive to force him to toe the party line. As the Ministry wizards arrive, Xenophilius attempts to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] Harry, but misses and causes an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Erumpent|Erumpent]] horn (which he had purchased believing it to be the horn of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crumple Horned Snorkack|Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]) to explode. Hermione, Ron, and Harry make their escape in the confusion, making sure that the Death Eaters see Harry and Hermione so that Xenophilius will not be punished for lying about Harry being there.

We hear later that Xenophilius has been arrested, though we don't hear details.

== Strengths ==

It is never made clear whether it is strength of character or inability to perceive his own difference, but Xeno steadfastly marches to the beat of his own drummer, no matter what the Wizarding population in general thinks of him.

== Weaknesses ==

Xeno's love of the strange and willingness to experiment has left him open to accepting an almost astounding number of crackpot theories, many of which we hear at second hand from his daughter Luna. It is these crackpot theories which have made his publication, ''The Quibbler'', something of a laughing stock.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

The only thing that apparently can make Xeno toe the &quot;party line&quot; seems to be the capturing of his daughter. He is willing to go to extreme lengths, abandoning his own principles and turning Harry over to the Ministry, in order to regain Luna's freedom.

== Analysis ==

&quot;Xenophilius&quot; is accurately named, as it translates to &quot;love of the strange&quot; or &quot;love of strange things.&quot;

The seventh book requires that Harry be taught the nature of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], and the plot line requires that it be fairly late in the story, so that he may understand their nature more gradually than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] did. Dumbledore knew that he was seen as being authoritative. While he knew that the Hallows existed, and where they were, he also knew that if he passed that information on to Harry, it would cause Harry to pursue them, rather than seeking and destroying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. While Dumbledore did leave a few hints to the nature of the Hallows for Harry to find, there are many which he could not have planted or predicted; however, no matter where they came from, in the end the hints led Harry and Hermione to Xeno. Xeno's extreme eccentricity decreases the immediacy of the Hallows; his evident belief in Snorkacks and other impossible creatures makes his belief in the Hallows equally suspect. This suspicion is all that prevents Harry from abandoning the search for Horcruxes, in the hope that possession of the three Hallows will allow him to &quot;conquer Death&quot; and thus avoid being killed by Voldemort.

Given the requirement that the information about the Hallows be provided by a friendly but untrustworthy source, it is clear that the publisher of the Wizarding world's equivalent of ''The Weekly World News'' would be a leading candidate for that role. It is uncertain whether the author had this role in mind for Xeno when ''The Quibbler'' was introduced in book 5, but we can see that he fits the requirements perfectly.

One of the things Harry finds while looking through Xeno's messy workroom is an attempt to recreate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]] lost diadem. While Xeno's attempt, using the strange mock-magical artifacts that he is so fond of, is doomed to failure, this is our first exposure to a potential artifact of the fourth Founder. To date, we have been made aware of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin's]] locket, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's sword]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff's cup]]; the reader likely expects that a fourth artifact will surface, for the sake of symmetry, and may in fact believe that it will be found to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], as two of the other three have been. It will turn out that the Diadem has been found and made into a Horcrux, and that Harry has already unknowingly handled it; the Trio will have to return to Hogwarts to recover it.

'''Tarhana Çorbası''' is a Turkish soup made from a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] and dehydrated mix of flour, yogurt, onions, tomatoes and green peppers. The exact composition of ''tarhana'' differs from region to region in Turkey. 

==Ingredients==
===for the Tarhana===
*3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|ripe tomatoes]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] / 500 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] [[Cookbook:Yogurt|live yogurt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Yeast|dried active yeast]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Water|tepid water]] (ca. [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|100ºF / 40ºC]])
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*⅛ tsp. [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

===for the Soup===
*1 cup  dry tarhana mix
*7 - 8 cups [[Cookbook:Stock|meat stock]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]

==Procedure==
*Always follow all [[w:en:Food safety|FOOD SAFETY]] precautions when preparing food.
&lt;br&gt;
# Dissolve the sugar in the tepid water and sprinkle the dried yeast on top.  Allow to soften 5 minutes or so and stir.
# Blanche, peel and seed the tomatoes. Peel, dice and roughly chop the onions. Remove the stem, seeds and membrane from the green peppers and cut roughly.
# In a blender or food processor, purée the tomatoes, onion, green pepper and yogurt in batches.
# Combine all the ingredients except the flour and mix well.  Gradually add enough flour to make a stiff dough.  Knead for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic then place in a large non-reactive bowl and cover with waxed paper (don't use plastic wrap). Let stand at room temperature for 10 to 12 days.  Punch down the dough once a day.  If the dough becomes watery, knead in some more flour.  Let stand until the dough no longer rises and has lost its stretch.  Rub the dough between your hands onto a tray covered with parchment paper so that it forms small pieces.  Cover the tray with cheesecloth or other protective mesh and leave to dry in a cool, well ventilated place.  As it dries, break the dough into smaller pieces eventually crumbling it as small as you can.  When it is completely dry (a week or more) pulverize in a blender, a little at a time.  Store in freezer bags or large jars.  Store in a cool place or refrigerate. May be kept up to twelve months.
# To make tarhana soup, mix 1 cup of the dried dough mix with 3 cups of water or meat stock. Mix with a wooden spoon until softened.  Add more water or stock to make a thickish soup with a creamy consistency. Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour into bowls and garnish with croûtons, parsley, or paprika-infused butter or olive oil, if desired. Serve with Turkish bread or a crisp baguette.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Do not use pasteurized yogurt. The live yogurt culture helps prevent contamination by harmful organisms.
* The yogurt and yeast may be replaced with 1 pint of [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]], which supplies both the bacteria and yeasts for the fermentation. Some traditional recipes for tarhana refer to kefir as &quot;soured milk&quot;.
* All utensils, and containers should be sterilized with boiling water before use. Wash your hands each time before handling the dough directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About the Distributive Property ==

I know this isn't arithmetic, but I was wondering if we could describe the properties of real numbers in summary a bit, and maybe mention different ways distributive property of multiplication can be used.  In the example, 15(6x - 22), I found it interesting that I could simplify this for me even further by making it into 30(3x - 11), whereas anything done to the groups of numbers inside the parenthesis must have the inverse operation performed on the object outside of it.  Anything wrong with adding a note on distributive there?  This chapter's pretty short at the moment, and I don't see much wrong with it ^.^;; [[User:TheAdventMaster|TheAdventMaster]] 23:07, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

== Nonstandard definitions of subsets of the integers? ==

I have never seen &quot;natural number&quot; used to refer to the set {1, 2, 3, ...}.
These are called the &quot;counting numbers&quot;, if anything, since you use them for
counting.  The &quot;natural numbers&quot; are the counting numbers plus zero, the numbers
that appear in nature.  (Nature often provides us with zero of something.)
Finally, I have never seen &quot;whole number&quot; used other than synonymously with
&quot;integer&quot;.  I believe this page should be modified to correct these definitions.

(This is my first ever input to WikiAnything, so apologies for newbie-like behavior.)
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:209.150.54.84|209.150.54.84]] ([[User talk:209.150.54.84|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/209.150.54.84|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

== Challenge answers ==

The challenge questions lack answers, I was hoping for a discussion of the &quot;whys&quot;

== Rational and irrational numbers. ==

Going by the definition of rational numbers, I wonder if we can regard the rational numbers as a subset of the irrational numbers. If not, then the paragraph where the numbers listed were regarded as a subset of the numbers following needs to be edited. It seems to present the rational numbers as a subset of the irrational numbers.

== Transcendental Numbers ==

Should we delete the section on Transcendental numbers? I don't know much about them, but it's hard to even tell if a number is one of these. If it is kept, someone should clear up the vocabulary that is hard to comprehend by a student teaching himself by using this guide.

: I agree this section is out of place, it is not for a few section that this book defines variables, it doesn't really make sense to talk about roots of polynomial equations at this point. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:32, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

== To Do ==
I moved the section &quot;Basic laws in Algebra&quot; from the &quot;Solving Equations&quot; page.  It restates the properties in a more rigorous manner, which I think is helpful, but now it needs to be edited so the merge is clearer.  I added a pointer back to this page from the solving equations page. [[User:Nfgdayton|Nfgdayton]] ([[User talk:Nfgdayton|talk]]) 17:35, 23 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==RED or the other way round==
Whilst i appreciate the usefulness of the acronym to remember, it was deliberately written out as direct pressure, elevation and rest, because this is the priority order for treament, and i think it should be this way round in the explanation.

==Nosebleeds==
I often get severe nosebleeds (sometimes lasting more than an hour) and have tried almost everything imaginable to treat nosebleeds. Pinching your nose closed and waiting for it to stop is one of the least effective methods. 

I recently discovered that if I pour a bit of vinegar (or any form of ethanoic acid) onto a small amount of toilet paper/tissue and shove it up my nose, making sure the vinegar comes into contact with the source of bleeding, then the bleeding will stop within about 5 seconds. So far it has worked every time I tried this method and I would much rather recommend this method that pinching your nose and waiting for it to stop.

'''Tomato Paste''' is a basic ingredient used in innumerable dishes in the cuisines of many countries.  It is prepared by reducing tomato purée on low heat for several hours.  While commercially produced tomato paste is the usual source, it can be prepared at home by the following method.

==Ingredients==

*1 gallon / 1.5 litres [[Cookbook:Tomato Concassé|tomato pulp]]
*1 cup sweet red [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|peppers]], chopped
*1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
&lt;br&gt;
*Always follow all [[w:en:Food safety|FOOD SAFETY]] precautions when preparing food.
&lt;br&gt;
# Cook the ingredients over low heat in a large wide covered stockpot for an hour. 
# Pass the mixture through a food mill several times starting with the coarsest grid and progressing to the finest&lt;ref&gt;''This will actually be faster than trying to force it through a fine sieve in a single pass.''&lt;/ref&gt;
# Return the pot to the stove and heat uncovered over very low heat for 3 hours or more until very thick, stirring frequently to avoid burning. (Use a heat diffusing mat or trivet. A double boiler would be ideal as it would prevent burning but will take longer.)
# Pour into new sterilized ½-pint preserving jars&lt;ref&gt;''Always check well for chips or cracks and discard if found.''&lt;/ref&gt; leaving ¼-inch of space at the top. Cover with new seals and screw on the lids securely but not too tightly. Process in a boiling water bath for 45 minutes. Remove from the water bath with tongs and allow to cool on an inverted oven rack for 12 hours. Test the seal by pressing the centre of each lid with your forefinger.  If the inner lid does not move, remove the outer ring.  Store in a cool, dry, dark place.

==Notes==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

This is a brief description of the parameters recognized by
Celestia v1.4.1 in DSC files (Deep Space Catalogs).
DSC Galaxy functionality has undergone a substantial
improvement when compared to the previous versions of Celestia.

A DSC catalog file can be used to describe three classes of objects:
'''OpenCluster''', '''Nebula''' or '''Galaxy'''.

A DSC object definition consists of its class, a quoted name, and its parameters
enclosed in braces:
 &lt;i&gt;'''Class''' &lt;/i&gt; ''&quot;name&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... }

==List of Parameters==
Class:
* '''OpenCluster''' &quot;''name''&quot;
* '''Nebula''' &quot;''name''&quot;
* '''Galaxy''' &quot;''name''&quot;
* '''GlobularCluster''' &quot;''name''&quot;

Location:
* '''RA''' ''f'', '''Dec''' ''f'', '''Distance''' ''f''

or
* '''Position''' [''f'' ''f'' ''f'']

Orientation:
* '''Axis''' [''f'' ''f'' ''f'']
* '''Angle''' ''f'' 

Size:
* '''Radius''' ''f''

Information:
* '''InfoUrl''' &quot;''URL''&quot;

Appearance:
* '''Mesh''' &quot;''filename''&quot;
* '''Type''' &quot;''string''&quot;
* '''CustomTemplate''' &quot;''filename''&quot;
* '''AbsMag''' ''f'' or '''Appmag''' ''f''

== OpenCluster &quot;&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&quot; == 
&lt;ul&gt;
&quot;name&quot; is the name of the object. Multiple names can be speciied 
within the quotes if they're separated by colons (:).

&lt;b&gt;OpenCluster&lt;/b&gt; currently is used only to associate the specified
&quot;name&quot; with a position in space. The members of an OpenCluster are defined separately in one or more [[Celestia/STC_File|.STC files]] or in [[Celestia/Binary_Star_File|stars.dat]].

The parameters used to define an OpenCluster are

=== placement === 

A deep space object's position can be defined either by specifying a single position vector or by specifying its three astronomical coordinates.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Position&lt;/b&gt; &lt;tt&gt;[&lt;i&gt; f f f &lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The position vector's [x y z ] coordinates are in Light Years, 
specifying a position in Celestia's
Ecliptic J2000 &quot;Universal&quot; coordinate system 
&lt;/li&gt;
or
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; (default: 1.0)
in LightYears
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; (default: 0.0)
Right Ascension in fractional Hours (unlike [[Celestia/STC_File|STC catalogs]], which use fractional degrees)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dec&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt;  (default: 0.0)
Declination in fractional degrees

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===  orientation (optional)=== 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;3 vector&lt;/i&gt; (default: [ 1.0 0.0 0.0] )
&lt;br&gt;a unit vector specifying the orientation of the object's axis
in Celestia's Ecliptic J2000 &quot;Universal&quot; coordinate system 

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angle&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; (default: 0.0 degrees)&lt;br&gt;the amount the object is rotated around that Axis.
&lt;/ul&gt;
=== size === 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radius&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt;  (default: 0.0)
in Light Years.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

=== information  (optional)=== 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoUrl&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;string&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&quot;string&quot; should be the URL of a web page describing the object.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Nebula  &quot;&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&quot; == 
 
&lt;ul&gt;Places a glowing model at the specified position and orientation.
&lt;br&gt;Uses all of the parameters used for &lt;b&gt;OpenCluster&lt;/b&gt; plus the following:

=== shape ===
 
* '''Mesh''' &quot;''filename''&quot; (optional)
 
:&quot;''filename''&quot; must be the name of a 3DS, CMS or CMOD model file which determines the Nebula's shape.

:The model's internal material may require an associated PNG, JPG or DDS surface texture image file to be in the object's subdirectory &lt;tt&gt;/textures/medres&lt;/tt&gt; to define the Nebula's coloration. 

:If '''Mesh''' is omitted, no object is drawn.

&lt;/ul&gt;

== Galaxy   &quot;''name''&quot; == 

&lt;ul&gt;

Places a glowing image of a galaxy at the specified position and orientation
&lt;br&gt;Uses all of the parameters used for &lt;b&gt;OpenCluster&lt;/b&gt; plus the following:

=== shape === 
* '''Type''' &quot;''string''&quot;

&lt;ul&gt;&quot;string&quot; should be one of: S0,Sa,Sb,Sc,SBa,SBb,SBc,E0,E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,Irr

:The '''Type''' is shown in Celestia's on-screen informational display. It also determines which PNG image in Celestia's Models directory is used to define the shape of the '''Galaxy's''' image.
&lt;/ul&gt;

or

* '''CustomTemplate'''  &quot;''filename''&quot; (optional)
&lt;ul&gt;&quot;''filename''&quot; must be a the name of a PNG image defining the shape of this Galaxy.
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== brightness === 

* '''AppMag''' ''number''

or 
* '''AbsMag''' ''number''
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Example ==

   '''Nebula &quot;M16&quot; '''
   '''{'''
      '''Mesh &quot;1995-44-a.3ds&quot;'''
      '''Axis    [0.205007 -0.737927 -0.642989]'''
      '''Angle 146.298'''
      '''RA 18.31404'''
      '''Dec -13.8311'''
      '''Distance 7002'''
      '''Radius 3.45''' 
   '''}'''

'''Arab cuisine''' is the cuisine of the Arabic-speaking nations and those regions where the influence of the former Islamic Empire has left its influence on the local people's language and/or eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;''Food: A Culinary History from Antiquity to the Present'', by M.Montanari and J.L.Flandrin, Columbia Univ. Press (1999) ISBN 0-231-11154-1&lt;/ref&gt; While it is useful to place it, in its entirety, in the catagory of [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern cuisine]], because it shares much in common, it includes regions that are not part of the geographical Middle East.  It should be noted that both the terms &quot;[[w:en:Arab|Arab]]&quot; and &quot;[[w:en:Middle East|Middle East]]&quot; are imprecise, however.

Hi, my name is [[w:Daniel|Dan]] and I am a [[w:Christianity|Christian believer]] from [[w:South India|South India]]. My username is what it is because I have been using the alias &quot;ajcfreak&quot; for quite some time now. JC stands for [[w:Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the whole alias of &quot;aJCfreak&quot; is cos I simply ''love'' the concept of a Jesus Freak, as portrayed in the [[w:Jesus Freak (song)|dc Talk song]]. I am an editor of sorts on the [[w:Wikipedia|English Wikipedia]] and my work there (more specifically, my work on the [[w:Portal:Christian music|Christian music portal]]) brought me here. To know more about me, please take a look at [[w:User:Ajcfreak|my userpage there]].

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Strategy-structure.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Strategy-structure.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. The image that may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. 

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|help desk]]. Thank you.

:G'day, you're nearly there, but you need to specify one of the [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Image namespace|licensing tags]] - e.g. {{tl|PD-self}}, {{tl|GFDL}}, {{tl|CC-self}}, etc. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:12, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

::G'day, I see that these images still don't specify a license, although your more recent uploads do. Could you please edit your earlier uploads and add one of the license tags to them, while they're still &quot;fresh&quot;? If you don't, then sometime down the track an admin is likely to delete them as unlicensed - best to act now, and preserve them! All you need to do is click &quot;edit this page&quot; on each one, and add a tag like {{tl|PD-self}} (including the braces). thanks, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:11, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

== Syntax highlighting ==

G'day, you seem to be doing a lot of syntax highlighting the hard way. Did you know that we now have a source code extension that handles that for us? e.g.:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
class SingletonObject {
    private static SingletonObject object;

    private SingletonObject() {
       //Instantiate the object.
    }

    public static SingletonObject getInstance() {
        if (object == null) {
            object = new SingletonObject(); // Create the object for the first and last time
        }
        return object;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The trick is to wrap your code in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of the usual &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; stuff. The result isn't quite the same as what you're doing, but it's close, and a damn site easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Persistence_(computer_science)|Persistence]]''', in computer science, is an adjective describing data that outlives the process that created it. Java persistence could be defined as storing anything to any level of persistence using the Java programming language, but obviously this would be too broad a definition to cover in a single book. That is why this book is more focused on storing Java [[Wikipedia:Object (computer_science) | objects]] to [[Wikipedia:Relational_databases | relational databases]]. In particular using the [[Wikipedia:Java_Persistence_API | Java Persistence API]] (JPA).

There are many ways to make data persist in Java, including (to name a few): [[Wikipedia:JDBC | JDBC]], [[Wikipedia:Serialization | serialization]], file IO, [[Wikipedia:J2EE_Connector_Architecture | JCA]], [[Wikipedia:Object_databases | object databases]], and [[Wikipedia:XML_database | XML databases]].  However, the majority of data is persisted in databases, specifically relational databases.  Most things that you do on a computer or web site that involve storing data, involve accessing a relational database. Relational databases are the standard mode of persistent storage for most industries, from banking to manufacturing.

There are many things that can be stored in databases with Java.  Java data includes strings, numbers, date and byte arrays, images, XML, and Java objects.  Many Java applications use Java objects to model their application data. Because Java is an [[Wikipedia:Object Oriented | Object Oriented]] language, storing Java objects is a natural and common approach to persisting data from Java.

There are many ways to access a relational database from Java, JPA is just the latest of many different specifications, but it seems to be the direction that most programmers are heading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The PTM_Training project was initiated by a work-order from professor Mdj of the College of Education at The University of Montana (hereinafter &quot;client&quot;), to be developed by the University Central Web Services team (hereinafter &quot;agency&quot;), headed by RobertB.&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that some names and specifics have been altered to protect proprietary and privileged information.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC|limit=2|float=none}}

== Project initiation ==
The development team consisted of:

* SteveM (application developer);
* AndrewL (application developer);
* RonaldS (system administrator for production servers);
* PattyZ (graphic designer); and
* StudentTeam (three to five undergraduate students under the supervision of SteveM and RobertB, to assist as needed on the project).

The work order specified that the project was to consist of a web-based &quot;professional training interface&quot; to be used by the College of Education (and potentially other institutions) to coordinate and develop opportunities for professional development among teachers.

All work on the project was conducted on the University campus facilities, using the development and production servers owned and maintained by the agency. The client agreed to pay agency for development and maintenance fees and the work was conducted according to a written memorandum of understanding (hereinafter &quot;MOU&quot;) between the parties.

== Project phases ==
The project phases (established and agreed upon in advance by RobertB, SteveM, and the client) consisted of the following:
* Definition stage
* Design stage
* Development stage
* Deployment stage
* Maintenance stage

== Definition stage ==
=== Challenges ===
* Neither the work order nor the MOU contained a detailed feature set specification or existing example application to use as a reference.
* The client had some fairly novel ideas which would preclude a simple reuse of preexisting code assets.
* The client intended to use the output of the project for a presentation to other colleges and state agencies. This would put pressure on the project output to be &quot;impressive&quot; as well as &quot;functional&quot;.
* The timing of the project initiation relative to the academic calendar essentially guaranteed that there would be staff turnover among the student workers.
* Some members of the StudentTeam had little or no prior experience in the areas where they would be helping out.

=== Advantages ===
* The agency had a fairly substantial mix of production assets and a reasonably-skilled staff. This meant that there was some flexibility in the choice of development tools and operating systems for the application developers.
* The novelty and profile of some aspects of the project meant that the development team was given some leeway by RobertB in establishing priorities and requesting additional resources if urgently needed. RobertB also took care to establish reasonable expectations with the client, thus the client allowed for some flexibility on the project deliverables as well.

=== Responses ===
* Because of the relative high profile of the project, it had to proceed despite the lack of a thoroughly defined project specification. The &quot;definition&quot; phase would have to be revisited from time to time. Because of this SteveM opted to proceed using an &quot;incremental prototyping&quot; strategy for the project.
* The technologies chosen by SteveM were selected primarily for maximum familiarity among available staff, ease of use, ease of prototyping and ease of migration to &quot;production&quot; infrastructure once the definition and design had solidified. 

These included:
* Microsoft Access (design-stage database to be migrated to MSFT SQL server for production-stage);
* Allaire (now Macromedia) Cold Fusion Web application server;

=== Beginning of feature set specification ===
SteveM and AndrewL proceeded to work with the client to get precise definitions for required features.

After some iterative consultation with the client, it was agreed the following would be needed:
* A web application compatible with the latest release of the top two browsers in use for the latest version of Microsoft Windows;
* user accounts capable of logging in through the web;
* anonymous access through the web for limited features;
* administrative accounts capable of modifying aspects of the web app and managing user accounts, all through the web;
* a &quot;skinnable&quot; graphical application interface that could also be modified and managed by admin accounts;
* support for user activity audits, record-keeping, statistics and routine reporting;

SteveM concluded that the application would essentially consist of a mix of an online: 1) product catalog; 2) event management system; 3) course management system (with support for credits and &quot;grading&quot;); 4) role-based authentication system; and 5) discussion forum.

At the time of project initiation, there were no existing products or resources available that would meet the client expectations, thus justifying in-house development over off-the-shelf purchase.

== Design stage ==
SteveM and AndrewL began design on a database schema. SteveM began on the skeleton framework for the web application. To further streamline development and increase chances of successful delivery, SteveM opted to code the using the &quot;FuseBox&quot; application framework for ColdFusion.

Halfway through the initial design stages. AndrewL was pulled into another project, thus significantly reducing his availability for PTM_Training. This required SteveM to assume complete responsibility for the design, and also required a lot more contemporaneous technical documentation, so that AndrewL could be kept up to speed on the system for times when he was available to help.

== Development stage == 
SteveM worked primarily with the StudentTeam for the initial phases of development. At the end of the semester, the StudentTeam was significantly reduced.

=== Challenges ===
* The available student developers had little or no computer programming experience.

=== Responses ===
* Routine code review sessions were established by SteveM to keep track on the progress of the student developers. These code reviews included an opportunity for the students to re-allocate time and self-select, to the extent feasible, for tasks that more closely matched their abilities and preferences.
* Routine unit testing sessions were conducted on all code modules to ensure that there would be no data integrity problems. This was necessary because &quot;live&quot; use of the project had begun prematurely, and the database contained data that people actually cared about, the loss of which would not have been acceptable. Although this is against best practices. This was anticipated early on because of the nature and scope of the project as established in the definition phase.

== Deployment stage ==
Deployment for the project consisted of a migration of the code-base to the production web server machine, and a transfer of the database contents and schema to the MSFT SQL Server host. The deployment was not difficult, however there were some &quot;gotchas&quot; related to name resolution and resource allocation differences between the development machines and the production servers. These were quickly tracked down and the code was re-factored to compensate.

== Maintenance stage ==
Maintenance proved an ongoing element of the entire system development, but was, ironically enough, not a significant problem after the first deliverables on the project were deployed for use and made available to the client. Eventually, the client had a relatively fruitful demonstration of the project, and the code and resources were later bought by an outside company. SteveM and the client were the named authors of the system and received royalties for the purchased code-base. All further maintenance and extension of the code-base was managed by the outside company after an initial phase of consultation and review by SteveM, so they could be brought up to familiarity with the essential elements of the system.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] find themselves lying on the ground in a forest. At first, Harry thinks it is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], but quickly realizes the trees are too young. Ron's shoulder has been severely Splinched while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparating]]. Hermione treats his injury with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dittany|Essence of Dittany]], though he remains faint from shock and blood loss. Hermione says she Disapparated them from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] grabbed her when Harry Apparated the Trio there. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Revulsion Jinx|jinxed]] him, then Apparated them to the forest where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] was held. It is unlikely they can return to Grimmauld Place. As Hermione has been a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret Keeper]] since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] death and led Yaxley to Grimmauld Place, it is probably now known to him. Harry blames himself for losing their hiding place, wasting time to retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]]'s magical eye.

Remembering how quickly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] found them at the Tottenham Court Road, Harry and Ron debate whether they should stay or move on, but Ron is too weak to travel. As Hermione casts the protective spells, Harry summons the tent from her bag. Ron stops Hermione from speaking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s name, saying it &quot;feels&quot; jinxed and requests that Harry and Hermione refrain from using it.

Hermione retrieves the egg-sized Locket, which bears the initial &quot;S&quot; inset in small green stones on its cover. Harry determines it must be opened before it can be destroyed, but it is tightly shut. Ron detects a small heartbeat within, but Harry and Hermione are uncertain if they hear or feel anything. To keep it safe until it can be destroyed, Harry places it around his neck. He and Hermione then prepare to stand guard using Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|Sneakoscope]].

Standing watch, Harry starts having awful thoughts. Rather than feeling elated over finding the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], Harry feels lost, unsure how to proceed, and clueless as to how to destroy the Horcrux. Though worried about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher's]] safety, Hermione and Harry had decided against summoning him, fearing a Death Eater may come by side-along apparition. And his scar is hurting again.

Harry slips inside Voldemort's mind again and sees an old man suspended upside down. Voldemort, addressing the man as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], demands something that Gregorovitch claims was stolen from him long ago. Voldemort enters Gregorovitch's memories and sees a tall, blond man who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Gregorovitch before exiting through a window. When Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Gregorovitch, Harry returns to himself. Hermione dismisses the notion that he was reading Voldemort's mind, then takes over the watch. Inside the tent, Harry tells Ron about Gregorovitch's memory, and thinks he has seen the blond thief before. Ron wonders why Voldemort would kill Gregorovitch if he wanted him to make a new wand or if Voldemort was trying to create another Horcrux. Harry thinks Voldemort's soul may be too shredded to allow for another Horcrux. Harry falls asleep wondering about the blond thief. With Gregorovitch gone, the man's life is in danger now.

== Analysis ==

Until now, Dumbledore's quest has mainly tested the Trio's intellectual and magical prowess rather than their physical abilities. Now, forced to leave their cozy hiding place, they must endure the harsh environment while on the run, coping with the oncoming cold winter weather, limited food supplies, and being cut off from their allies, who at least knew their location, and could communicate if needed. Losing their headquarters is a huge blow to the mission, but fortunately, Hermione was well prepared for this eventuality and had packed everything they need inside her bag. However, despite Hermione providing them with a snug tent containing a kitchen, bunks, and other necessities, it hardly compares to Grimmauld Place's amenities and Kreacher's attentive care. The hardship could cause the Trio's morale to plunge to an all-time low. But they may have needed just such an incentive to force them into leaving Grimmauld Place and searching more aggressively for the other Horcruxes, rather than sequestering themselves in an endless attempt to hypothesize what and where they might be.

This unexpected shift in the mission's direction also focuses attention on each Trio member's character. For the recuperating Ron, used to three hot meals a day and comfortable living conditions, the quest's increasing hardships may prove especially difficult. Ron has always seemed less suited for the mission than Harry and Hermione, but his having been raised in the Wizarding world does allow him to contribute in ways they are unable. His ability to detect a &quot;heartbeat&quot; within the Locket while the others cannot and &quot;feeling&quot; that Voldemort's name could be jinxed, may indicate that he has far more magical ability than he ever realized. These emerging traits could be a major turning point in Ron's maturation and magical development. However, his severe injury and being emotionally burdened by knowing that his family is in grave danger if it is ever discovered that he is helping Harry, could prove to be a set-back.  

Hermione reacting incorrectly under stress is seen again here. While it is almost certainly true that Yaxley is now privy to Number 12, Grimmauld Place's location, this does not automatically make him a Secret Keeper as Hermione mistakenly believes. She may be over-generalizing from her own experience. It is true that having been privy to the secret, Hermione has become a Secret-Keeper herself, but that happened only because Dumbledore, the original Secret-Keeper, had died. For Yaxley to become a Secret-Keeper for the house's location at Grimmauld Place, it would be necessary for the person who revealed that secret to him, in this case Harry, who was the prime mover in the Apparition, to die. So long as Harry remains alive, Yaxley can enter the house, but he is unable to reveal where it is to any other person. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] remains far more threatening, as he is a Secret Keeper and so can freely divulge Grimmauld Place's location. The one factor that increases the risk is that Yaxley now knows that three Order members were still resident at Grimmauld Place, which might inspire Snape to reveal that secret, or cause Voldemort to force Snape to reveal it, if he has discovered that Snape is a Secret Keeper. Just why Snape never entered the house while the Trio was there, or shared this information with other Death Eaters so they could enter, is puzzling.

Harry's using magic to Summon the Dittany from Hermione's bag is partly a demonstration. When the Trio fled the wedding to Tottenham Court Road, the two Death Eaters found them immediately, though Harry did not cast any magic before the Death Eaters arrived. Since then, all the magic that Harry had performed was while he was at Grimmauld Place or within the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], two locations where it would be undetectable. This was the first time that he performed magic in the open. If Harry still carried the Trace that detects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|underage magic]], as he suspected he was, this first unprotected use of magic would have brought Death Eaters, but it did not. Therefore, there must have been some other mechanism that allowed the Death Eaters to find him; Ron may have some idea regarding what that is.

Once again, despite nearly being killed or captured, the Trio was reluctant to inflict harm on an enemy, even under combat conditions. Other Order of the Phoenix members probably would have executed or incarcerated Yaxley, whom Hermione believes has now become a Secret Keeper and can expose Grimmauld Place's location to Voldemort. Hermione instead opted to Disapparate the Trio to the countryside, sacrificing their hiding place rather than take a life. Apart from killing Yaxley or Stunning and turning him over to the Order of the Phoenix to deal with, Hermione presumably also had the option of incapacitating him and then working a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|Memory Charm]] on him, though Hermione may be aware that Memory Charms can be ineffective when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] counters them. Apparently, however, the chaotic and dangerous situation is perhaps preventing her from thinking or acting rationally, and likely caused her to panic.  

Knowing that Voldemort is searching for Gregorovitch, a wandmaker, it initially seems apparent that Voldemort wants a new wand or is looking for an explanation as to why Harry's wand always defeats his own. No matter what wand Voldemort wields, Harry's wand seems impervious. If Voldemort only wanted a new wand, presumably he would have Gregorovitch make him one, with the expectation that a wand made by a different artisan would be protected from the same fate as the other wands he used on Harry. As was seen with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], Voldemort's persuasion techniques tend to leave an artisan in a rather unsuitable state to perform fine craftsmanship. However, having found Gregorovitch, Voldemort asks him about something he is thought to have once owned. Although Gregorovitch claims he never possessed it, Voldemort sees in his memory that someone stole it from him; it is unknown what that object was or who the thief might be. As Voldemort then murders Gregorovitch, it seems our assumption about Voldemort wanting to have a new wand made is incorrect. What, then, is Voldemort seeking?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Ron becomes more adversely affected by close physical contact with the Locket Horcrux than the other two, somewhat akin to Harry initially being more sensitive to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] than others. The Locket does also seem to have an immediate effect on Harry when he first wears it, but, unlike Ron, who increasingly grows agitated and hostile, Harry experiences despair. He realizes in the next chapter that the Locket is engendering this emotion only after Hermione relieves him of it, causing him to immediately feel better. 

Ron's instinct that Voldemort's name feels &quot;jinxed&quot; will prove to be more than mere superstition on his part. Voldemort's name has been tabooed; anyone speaking it immediately alerts Death Eaters and Snatchers, Voldemort's bounty hunters, to their location. Voldemort knows that unlike most other Wizards, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] members in general, and Harry in particular, do not fear speaking his name, thus making it easy to locate them. This is yet another example of Harry's predictable behavior often being used against him, just as when he revealed his presence by executing what has become [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|his signature spell]], during the attack while leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley house]]. 

Although Harry's presence remained undetected when he uttered Voldemort's name inside Grimmauld Place, speaking it may have broken some protective charms on the building. We do not know why it did not seem to; possibly it was the age of the protective spells, or that the protective spells were cast by a Dark wizard that prevented it from breaking. Additionally, Grimmauld Place being unplottable may make it impossible to determine exactly where Harry is. It is possible that the magically-enforced taboo caused Harry to experience another painful session inside Voldemort's mind immediately after he spoke his name. Ron's twitchiness about Voldemort's name has resulted in it being largely unspoken to date, and that continues through this chapter and several more. 

The object Voldemort seeks is the Elder Wand, one of the three titular [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. Voldemort, raised in a Muggle orphanage, has never heard of the Deathly Hallows; he knew nothing about the Resurrection Stone when he made Gaunt's ring into a Horcrux, and he has never searched for Death's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. The Elder Wand, however, has its own history apart from the Hallows, and that attracted Voldemort's attention. It is certain that Dumbledore knew what powers the wand he wielded contained, and also that Harry, if he learned they existed, might try to find all three Hallows. While Dumbledore realized that Harry needed to learn about the Hallows, because Voldemort was searching for the Elder Wand, Dumbledore believed that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] were the greater danger, and so acted to delay Harry learning about the Hallows and their properties.

Also, though Harry's wand has grown more powerful and it has easily defeated any wand that Voldemort has wielded thus far, Harry will soon learn that his own wand is not indestructible.

It will be revealed later that the young blond thief is the evil Wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], who Dumbledore defeated in a duel, thus capturing the Elder Wand.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}

== Inertial Frames ==

Consider two inertial frames, X and Y. The X frame contains a stationary electric charge distribution. An observer in the X frame sees the electric charge distribution as being static, and observes an '''E''' field, but no '''B''' field, because the charge distribution is not moving with respect to the frame.

The frame Y is moving at a constant linear velocity with respect to the X frame. An observer in the Y frame sees the X frame as moving, sees the charge distribution in X as flowing, and therefore will measure a magnetic field due to the charge distribution in X.

Two observers, both looking at the same charge distributions from different frames will see two very different phenomina: The observer X sees no magnetic field, and the observer Y sees a magnetic field. 

== Magnetic and Electric Fields ==

According to special relativity, the magnetic field and the electric field are just two separate effects of the same underlying cause. In terms of special relativity, the magnetic field is just a ''correction'' to the electric field for observers in inertial frames. In other words, the magnetic field exists only to account for differences in the electric field among various observers.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] awaken, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] buries [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody's]] magical eye under a tree. They then shift camp to a small town, but Harry is unable to enter because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] are present. Ron is amazed; normally, Harry produces an excellent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], but he now seems incapable. Hermione suspects the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] may be affecting him. Harry immediately feels better when she takes it from him, but, remembering everything he did while wearing it, believes he was not possessed. He overrules Hermione's suggestion that they only carry the Locket, fearing it could be lost. Hermione suggests taking turns wearing it.

The Trio wanders the countryside, camping in a new location each night. Harry, Ron, and Hermione endlessly debate where the other Horcruxes could be. Harry is adamant that one is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], that being the only place [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] ever considered home. Ron thinks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] would have found it by now, but Harry reminds him that Dumbledore never claimed to know every Hogwarts secret. They find Tom Riddle's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 13|orphanage]] in London, but it has been demolished and replaced by offices. Hermione's suggestion to search the foundation is vetoed.

As they travel throughout the country, Ron, used to three hot meals a day, becomes increasingly annoyed with Hermione's cooking attempts. One night, Harry hears someone. Hermione silently deals out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], and his compatriot, Gornuk can be heard talking nearby. Also nearby is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and someone named Dirk, who was being transported to Azkaban but escaped. According to Dirk, Griphook told him that several Hogwarts students, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], sneaked into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s office and broke into the case containing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|the Sword of Gryffindor]]. They were caught and given detention. About a week later, Snape transferred the Sword to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|the Lestranges']] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] vault. But Griphook immediately recognized the sword was a Wizard-made fake. Dirk also mentions that the students had been &quot;cruelly punished.&quot; The group now believes that Harry Potter was telling the truth about Snape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|killing Dumbledore]], and anyone wanting to know what is really happening should read [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']]. Lately, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]] has been publishing truthful stories, without mentioning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crumple Horned Snorkack|Crumple-Horned Snorkacks]].

Shortly after, the party moves off. Hermione pulls out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus']] portrait. She blindfolds him so he is unable to report their location. Phineas updates them about Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], whose punishment was working in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. When asked about the Sword, Phineas explains that Goblin armor rejects ordinary dirt, accepting only that which makes it stronger. Harry wants Dumbledore brought from his office portrait, but the former Headmasters can only travel to their own portraits outside Hogwarts and to other portraits within the castle, nowhere else. Phineas, however, says that Dumbledore used the Sword to break open a ring.

Harry and Hermione realize that the Sword absorbed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] venom when Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|killed the Basilisk]] with it. Now it can destroy [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], but they have no idea where the Sword is located. When Harry asks Ron for his opinion, he appears unenthusiastic and agitated, and accuses Harry of not knowing what he is doing. A heated argument erupts, and Ron nearly attacks Harry. Hermione casts a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|shield charm]] to block him. Ron removes the Locket and threatens to leave; when Hermione refuses to go with him, Ron storms off into the night, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparating]].

== Analysis ==

This chapter is critical in that it reveals not only that Dumbledore destroyed the Ring Horcrux, but also that there is an additional way to use Basilisk venom to eliminate Horcruxes. Until this point, the only known venom source is the Basilisk fangs in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] underneath Hogwarts. Harry, apparently, is reluctant to return to Hogwarts, possibly fearing Snape. Now, we discover that the Sword of Gryffindor, which absorbed venom from the Basilisk that Harry killed, can be used to destroy Horcruxes. While a Basilisk fang or Gryffindor's Sword is needed to dispatch Horcruxes, the sword that was in Snape's office and is now secured in a vault at Gringotts Bank is only a replica and will not do the job. The problem now is, where is the real Sword of Gryffindor hidden and who might be hiding it?

Meanwhile, the mission suffers a severe blow with Ron's abrupt departure, which was motivated by several factors. Ron is affected more by the Horcrux Locket than the other two, so that his angers and fears are exacerbated to a greater extent whenever he wears the Locket. This often leaves him in a downbeat and negative mood. Additionally, compared to Harry who always suffered miserably at the Dursleys, Ron enjoyed everyday creature comforts, regular meals at home and Hogwarts, and being coddled by his overly-protective mother; his family situation thus left him more dependent than Harry and less self-sufficient than Hermione. Moreover, Ron as the youngest son had always been content to tag along after his older brothers, and is now doing the same with Harry and Hermione. Likely this is in part because he thought Harry knew more about what he was doing, and that Dumbledore had told Harry what to do. Even though Harry had strongly discouraged him from joining his mission, Ron had insisted on going, mostly out of loyalty and friendship. But injury, harsh living conditions, frustration with Harry's seeming indecisiveness, knowing his sister suffered punishment at Hogwarts, and constant worry about his family, coupled with the Locket's Darkness so strongly exerted upon him, have left Ron unable to control his anger and impatience. Eavesdropping on the other party, and hearing them preparing salmon when the best Hermione could manage was a bony pike, seems to have pushed him past his limit, resulting in Ron's lashing out at Harry. Harry, equally frustrated by what little and confusing information Dumbledore left him, and by his long-running uncertainty about what he could do once he found a Horcrux, is unable to contain his own temper and flares back at Ron, resulting in the latter's departure.

Although his full name is not mentioned here, the Dirk who is traveling with Ted Tonks may be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]], one-time head of the Goblin Liaison Office in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. This would explain why he was traveling with Griphook, as well as suggest why he had to leave the Ministry&amp;mdash;in an earlier chapter, we saw that Dirk had been investigated and &quot;found&quot; to have Muggle ancestry.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We recall that Harry had destroyed Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, and that Hermione had mentioned Basilisk venom as being among the rare items able to destroy a Horcrux. The reader may wonder why the Trio has not gone to Hogwarts to gather the dead monster's fangs that are still lying in the Chamber of Secrets and use them to destroy the Horcruxes, rather than beginning what now seems to be a nearly impossible quest for the Sword which could be anywhere. While that may seem logical, this apparently never occurred to them while planning the mission. If it had, and it was earlier on, they should have been able to safely return to Hogwarts while it was still under McGonagall's command and before Snape's return. However, it is probably a safe assumption that if the Trio realizes this now, Harry would probably only be able to enter Hogwarts once; he is unable to easily flit in, nab a fang, and nip back out again. Even with his Invisibility Cloak, Harry knows that Snape might detect his presence using Legilimancy, thus forcing Harry to stand and fight. Nor can an ally there retrieve and smuggle a fang to him because the Chamber of Secrets can only be opened by someone speaking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]], though Ron [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|later]] overcomes this particular obstacle. With Snape now Headmaster and the Carrows teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Dark Arts]], there is now a permanent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] presence at the school that, at least from the Trio's perspective, would make such an intrusion seem nearly impossible. Unknown to the Trio just yet, Snape would likely have avoided interfering.   

When the Trio must return to Hogwarts later in the book, it is Ron who realizes that the fangs can destroy Horcruxes, and he devises a way to enter the Chamber. Until then, Hogwarts is effectively inaccessible to the Trio, and, after hearing that the Sword is no longer at Hogwarts, Harry believes he no longer needs to go there to destroy the Locket Horcrux. Later, he learns that another soul shard is hidden at the school, forcing his return. For now, it is a great relief to him, and us, to know how Horcruxes can be destroyed without recourse to the Basilisk fangs in the Chamber, even if the Trio must still locate Gryffindor's real Sword with its Basilisk-venom infusion. It becomes clearer why Dumbledore attempted to bequeath the Sword to Harry. It is also logical to assume that it was Dumbledore who switched the real Sword for the fake one, with the intention that Harry would then find the genuine blade to destroy the Horcruxes. It will be revealed that Dumbledore knew he only had a short time left to live, which is probably when he included Gryffindor's Sword in his will as a clue that Harry would need it. Dumbledore apparently also arranged for an, as yet, unknown ally to dispatch the real Sword to Harry in an upcoming chapter.

To Ron's credit, he does attempt to rejoin the group immediately after his angry departure, but he runs into some unexpected trouble. Also, Dumbledore had anticipated that Ron, being the most immature and least prepared, might fail the mission at some point. Dumbledore's bequest to Ron, (the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]]), is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 19|a means]] for him to find his way back, should he ever become separated from the Trio, as Ron unexpectedly discovers later.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dynamic web pages and content management ==
Nearly all web-development I have done has followed a review of the currently-available web application frameworks. Rather than religiously assuming there is one &quot;right way&quot; or &quot;right language&quot; for deploying a solution, I tend to focus more on the practical constraints. Consistency, reliability, and extensive documentation are more important to me than adopting a course of action simply because it is the &quot;way it's always been done.&quot; Consequently, I have been fairly consistent in finding and implementing solutions that can be easily maintained throughout the system life cycle. 

Moreover, as a general requirement of staying current with the state of technology, I routinely review web content management systems and compare them for price, database compatibility and flexibility. In this area, I do have a preference for open source systems, especially MediaWiki. Nevertheless, any system that can be installed with minimal difficulty, modified without undue proprietary restrictions, and extended as needed, usually represents a good candidate for proposing to a prospective or current client. 

== Web accessibility ==
The principle methodology I have used is to make liberal reliance on Markup Validation Services to establish a &quot;baseline&quot; of markup and application consistency, and then design and deploy system elements that automatically generate compliant content with little or no deviation from the established baseline. Depending on the scope, duration and variability of the project, this can be difficult, but with adequate preparation and reliance on my existing toolkit and code-base, this generally has not been a problem.

Much of my experience in ensuring accessibility has been for multiple purposes. Although access by humans with alternate abilities is a prominent consideration, I have also developed many applications and application prototypes that require accessibility as either a technical constraint or a practical cost-cutting measure to guarantee interoperability between different systems. My work for Eturn-Xpherix was a compelling example, because many of our business partners and customers had already well-established data interchange formats and I.T. practices, and we would routinely have to 'customize our solutions' to best fit with their requirements. 

It is not routinely acknowledged, but ensuring accessibility ensures many ancillary benefits that accrue to ''all'' users of web content, as well as to developers and maintainers of web systems that either rely on or incorporate data from disparate sources, or require deployment and distribution on a wide variety of devices.

This is another reason why I place significant emphasis on a well-defined data model, and thorough documentation.</text>

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Hi, there is a dialogue at the end of this page:

   &quot; - Jak Ci na imię?&quot;
   &quot; - Mam na imię Kasia.&quot;
   &quot; - A jak on ma na imię? (And what is his name?) 
   &quot; - Aleksander.

There is a small problem with that - if you ask ''Jak Ci na imię?'' the answer should start with ''Na imię mi ...'', but it's somewhat old-fashioned, poetic and very polite, so very few people actually talk like that. The most common answer to that question, would simply be ''Kasia''. If you'd like to keep the answer in that form, you should simply ask ''Jak masz na imię?'', but again the most common answer to that would be ''Kasia''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Glossary==

I avoided looking in my brew manuals for a list of terms that should be defined so that I would not be tempted to copy thier definitions. The list of terms is therefore incomplete and quite insufficient.

The &quot;other&quot; section should be used to allow readers a way to ask what a word means, and any author can insert the term and definition in the appropriate category. However, I don't know if this is against any style guidelines for wikibooks, and quite honestly I don't feel like exerting the effort to find out. Of course, if it is, this discussion page could just as easily be used for that purpose. [[User:Schusselig|Schusselig]] 00:01, 31 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

The easiest way to learn how to use latex is to look at how other people use it. Here is a list of ''real world'' latex sources that are freely available on the internet. The information here is sorted by application area, so that it is grouped by the scientific communities that use similar notation and LaTeX constructs.

== General examples ==
Tutorial examples, books, and real world uses of LaTeX.
* [[LaTeX/caption.tex|caption.tex]], [[LaTeX/simple.tex|simple.tex]], [[LaTeX/wrapped.tex|wrapped.tex]]
* [ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/small2e.tex small2e.tex] and [ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/sample2e.tex sample2e.tex]. The &quot;official&quot; sample documents...
* [http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-2/eglen/ A short example of how to use LaTeX for scientific reports] by Stephen J. Eglen.
* [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/ The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX] by Tobias Oetiker is distributed with full latex sources.

== Semantics of Programming Languages ==

Articles on programming language research, from syntax to semantics, including source code listings, type rules, proof trees, and even some category theory. A good place to start is [http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csg264/latex/ Mitchell Wand's Latex Resources], including a sample file that also demonstrates Didier Remy's [http://cristal.inria.fr/~remy/latex/ mathpartir] package. The following are latex sources of some articles, books, or presentations from this field:
* [http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/talks/hw2005.tex Pugs: Bootstrapping Perl 6 with Haskell]. This paper by Audrey Tang contains nice examples on configuring the [[LaTeX/Packages/Listings|listings package]] to format source code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there. I think that the philisophy that you have applied of leraning to code by writing about it is a great one! I would like to be involved myself but what I would like to do is to give examples of vb code rather than C# (as I am a vb developer). I'm not sure what would be a better way of doing things - 

Would it be better to rewrite your work as a complete new book with vb examples or should I just go through the current book and put a vb example alongside the c# one? Of course if I rewrite the whole book I would without question credit you as the original author.

    pay attention: you nees for every .... a &quot;:&quot; and a paragrap (?? return) that the lifted letters don't stay in the upper text...
    maby you can insert a {{crd|&amp;nbsp;}} that the rows will have the same hight...

You see, my English is not the best... please correct it. And for any discussions: the template have to stay in the root of the wikibooks and not in any books, because it is unbearable to write something like { { : myProjekt / myBook /guitar / template / crd | Cj7 } } vor only a simple Cj7 in a song.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

3...dxe4 is black's only good move.  Other moves are not in the spirit of this opening.  This move also denies white his e4/d4 pawn center. White invariably responds with 4. Nxe4

=French Defence: Tarrasch Variation=

&quot;3...Nf6 is the most tactical option for black. He doesn't play for a solid position but prefers to complicate matters with dynamic play. Very interesting positions arise, with rich play and fascinating ideas for both sides (GM Andreas Tzermiadianos)&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
For those Black players who don't want to play with an isolated d-pawn (at least: not yet), the 3....Nf6 variation is a good
alternative to 3....c5.

White develops a piece to its ideal square and keeps his options open.  This move also is important for controlling the center.

This position is also often reached via the move order 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.d4

= King's Indian Defence = 
White intends to play e4 with this move. Developing this knight first also keeps options open for being able to play multiple lines against the King's Indian.

One of Black's most powerful weapon here is the [[Chess/Grünfeld Defence|Grünfeld Defence]] with [[/3...d5/]]. The main variation, 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 leads to a typical hypermodern situation where White has a powerful center that Black will have to attack from a distance with his dark bishop and a ...c5 pawn break.

[[/3...Bg7/]] and [[/3...d6/]] stick to the classical ideas behind the King's Indian, another venerable and popular opening.

===3. Nf3===
White develops a piece and continues his fight for the central dark squares.
This Knight developments while solid prevents White option of playing f3 or f4 and thus gives up options of the aggressive four pawns attack requiring  f4 and the Samisch which requires f3.

==About the Azerbaijani language==
===History===
The Azerbaijani language of today is based on the Oghuz language (brought from Central Asia by Seljuk Turks) heavily influenced by Persian and Arabic.

It gradually supplanted the previous Iranian languages — Tat, Azari, and Middle Persian in northern Iran, and a variety of Caucasian languages in the Caucasus, particularly Udi, and had become the dominant language before by the time of the Safavid dynasty; however, minorities in both the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran continue to speak the earlier Iranian languages to this day, and both Middle and New Persian loanwords are numerous in Azerbaijani.

The historical development of Azerbaijani can be divided into two major periods: early (ca. 16th to 18th century) and modern (18th century to present). Old Azerbaijani differs from its descendant in that it contained a much greater amount of Persian, Arabic, and Ottoman Turkish loanwords, phrases and syntactic elements. Early writings in Azerbaijani also demonstrate lingustic interchangeability between Oghuz and Kypchak elements in many aspects (such as pronouns, case endings, participles, etc...). As Azerbaijani gradually moved from being merely a language of epic and lyric poetry to being also a language of journalism and scientific research, its literary version has become more or less unified and simplified with the loss of many archaic Turkic elements, bulky Iranisms and Ottomanisms, and other words, expressions, and rules that failed to gain popularity among Azerbaijani-speaking masses.

Between ca. 1900 and 1930, there were several competing approaches to the unification of the national language in Azerbaijan popularized by the literati. Despite major differences, they all aimed primarily at making it easy for semiliterate masses to read and understand literature. They all criticized the overuse of Persian, Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, and European (mainly Russian) elements in both colloquial and literary language and called for a more simple and popular style.

The Russian conquest of the South Caucasus in the 19th century split the speech community across two states; the Soviet Union promoted development of the language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes - from Arabic alphabet to Latin to Cyrillic - while Iranian Azeris continued to use the Arabic script as they always had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani during the Soviet era, it became the official language of Azerbaijan only in 1978 (along with Georgian in Georgia and Armenian in Armenia). After independence, the Republic of Azerbaijan decided to switch again to the Latin script, following the Turkish/Pronunciation and Alphabet|Turkish model.

===Alphabets===
==Republic of Azerbaijan==
Before 1929, Azerbaijani was exclusively written in the Arabic script. From 1929-1938, a Latin script was used (although it was different from the one used now). From 1938 to 1991 a version of the Cyrillic script had been used. In 1991-1992, after the dissolution of the Former USSR, a new Latin script was introduced, based on the Turkish model. However, the transition from the Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet has been very slow, and the Cyrillic alphabet is still widely used.

==Iran==
The Arabic script has always been used to this day.

===Geographic distribution of Azerbaijani===
The estimated size of all Azeri speakers within Azerbaijan and Iran combined, according to two sources, differs from 23.4 to 30 million. This total does not include the Azeri speakers in Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Georgia, Dagestan and other smaller pockets within the Middle East and Russia. Ethnologue adds 864,000 for the speakers out of Iran and Republic of Azerbaijan.

=Nimzo-Indian Defence, Sämisch Variation =
==Sämisch Variation==
With 4.a3, the Sämisch named after the German Grandmaster Friedrich Sämisch, White immediately questions the placement of the bishop. This has the benefit of seizing the bishop pair early (if Black takes the knight), and resolving central tension. White will play for an eventual e4 push after f3.

Taking the Knight is pretty much an automatic response at master level as the alternative lose a tempo or lose a piece.
:4...Bxc3+ inflict the doubled pawns on White.
:4...Ba5?? Maintaining the pin is an error as it just loses the bishop after 5.b4 Bb6 6.c5.
:Playing 4...Be7?! is better, but it defeats the point of the Nimzo-Indian since White gets to play 5.e4 for free. (The point of the 3...Bb4 pin was to prevent White from doing this easily.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Orchid===
The Orchid family is the largest family of flowering plants, containing some 25,000 species.
Orchids, like the grasses and the palms, which they resemble in some ways—for instance the form of their leaves—are monocotyledons. They have one cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in contrast to the two of most flowering plants.  Orchids have simple leaves with parallel veins. Their shape is highly variable between species.
* Vanilla
* Lady's Slipper
* Orchid

===Lily===
Plants in this family have linear leaves, mostly with parallel veins, and flower parts in threes.
* Turk's Cap Lily
* Wild Garlic
* Onion
* Trillium
* Fawn Lily
* Tulip
* Hyacinth

===Mustard===
The family was formerly named Cruciferae (&quot;cross-bearing&quot;), because the four petals of their flowers are reminiscent of crosses.
* Cabbage
* Broccoli
* Cauliflower
* Brussels sprouts
* Mustard
* Horseradish
* Watercress

===Pink===
The leaves are almost always opposite, rarely whorled. The blades are entire, petiolate and often stipulate. These stipules are not sheathforming. The flowers are regular and mostly have 5-way symmetry, i.e. with 5 petals and 5 sepals, but sometimes with 4 petals. The sepals are free from one another or united. The petals are fringed or deeply cleft at the end.
* Carnation
* Bladder Campion
* Swamp Milkweed
* Common Milkweed
* Butterfly Plant
* Sand Milkweed
* Whorled Milkweed
* Deptford Pink

===Buttercup===
Plants in the Buttercup family are mostly herbaceous plants, but with some woody climbers (such as Clematis) and subshrubs (e.g. Xanthorhiza).  Leaves are very often more or less palmately compound.  The flowers have many free stamens arranged in a spiral and usually many free pistils. Flowers are most often grouped in terminal racemes, panicles or cymes.

* Delphinium
* Columbine
* Marsh Marigold
* Thimbleweed
* Clematis
* Hellbore
* Larkspur
* Buttercup

===Cactus===
Cacti are distinctive and unusual plants, which are adapted to extremely arid and hot environments, showing a wide range of anatomical and physiological features which conserve water. Their stems have expanded into green succulent structures containing the chlorophyll necessary for life and growth, while the leaves have become the spines for which cacti are so well known.
* Saguaro
* Barrel Cactus
* Prickly Pear
* Rabbit Ear

===Rose===
Members of the Rose family have 5 sepals and 5 petals which are flat and wavy at the margins.  Each flower has at least ten stamens.  All members of the rose family have a ''hypanthium'', which is a bowl-shaped part of a flower consisting of the bottoms of the sepals, petals, and stamens stuck together.  
* Rose
* Apple
* Blackberry
* Strawberry
* Raspberry
* Apple
* Plum
* Peach
* Cherry
* Pear

===Bean===
All members of this family have five-petaled flowers in which the superior ovary ripens to form a &quot;pod&quot;, technically called a legume, whose two sides split apart, releasing the seeds which are attached to one or both seams.  A significant characteristic of legumes is that they host bacteria in their roots, within structures called root nodules. These bacteria have the ability to take nitrogen gas out of the air and convert it to a form of nitrogen that is usable to the host plant. This process is called nitrogen fixation. 
* Bean
* Lupins
* Clover
* Alfalfa
* Peas
* Peanuts
* Soybeans
* Lentils
* Mimosa
* Kudzu

===Parsley===
The parsley family has flower clusters being in the form of a compound &quot;umbel&quot;.  The small flowers are radially symmetrical with 5 small sepals, 5 petals and 5 stamens.
* Cumin
* Parsley
* Carrot (Queen Anne's Lace)
* Dill
* Caraway
* Fennel
* Angelica

===Smartweed=== 
[[Image:Ocreae of a Persicaria maculosa 2006-aug-10 Gothenburg Sweden.jpg|thumb|180px|Plant stem with a prominent '''ocreae''']]
The seeds of the plants belonging to the smartweed family have a triangular shape.  Leaves of these plants have a peculiar pair of sheathing stipules known as ''ocreae''.
* Buckwheat
* Sorrel
* Rhubarb
* Knotgrass
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Bellflower===
The Bellflower family consists mostly of herbs, shrubs, and more rarely small trees, which usually have milky non-toxic sap. Leaves of these species are often alternate, more rarely opposite. They are also simple and without stipules. Flowers are bisexual, bell-shape, consisting of a narrow tube-like corolla with small spreading lobes. Flowers are fairly often blue. Fruits are often berries, but can also be capsules.
* Bluebell 
* Harebell
* Lobelia
* Balloonflower

===Mint===
The flowers in the Mint family typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip.  The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one or whorled.  The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.  The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with 5 united petals, 5 united sepals. They are usually bisexual and have a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers but actually consists of two crowded clusters.
* Basil
* Mint
* Rosemary
* Sage
* Savory
* Marjoram
* Oregano
* Thyme
* Lavender
* Perilla
* Self-heal

===Aster (Daisy)===
[[Image:Bidens flwr.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical Asteraceae flower head (here Bidens torta) showing the individual flowers]]
[[Image:Flower head.jpg|thumb|300px|Flowers of a sunflower with different forms and phases (sterile ray flowers, disc flowers in female, male and unopened phases)]]
Plants in the Aster family typically have one or both of two kinds of florets. The outer perimeter of a flower head like that of a sunflower is composed of florets possessing a long strap-like petal, termed a ligule; these are the ray florets. The inner portion of the flower head (or disc) is composed of small flowers with tubular corollas; these are the disc florets. The composition of asteraceous inflorescences varies from all ray flowers (like dandelions, genus Taraxacum) to all disc flowers (like pineapple weeds).
* Aster
* Common Daisy
* Oxeye Daisy
* Black-eyed Susan
* Lettuce
* Chicory
* Sunflower
* Safflower
* Jerusalem Artichoke
* Goldenrod
* Chrysanthemum 
* Dandelion
* Boneset
* Strawflower
* Ragwort

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Snapdragon===
The plants are annual or perennial herbs with flowers that are zygomorphic (can be divided by only a single plane into two mirror-image halves, much like a person's face), or rarely actinomorphic 
(can be divided into symmetrical halves by more than one longitudinal plane passing through the axis, much as a pie can be cut into several equal and identical pieces).
* Butterfly Bush
* Figwort
* Foxglove
* Mullein

== Planning ==

A well-planned book has a much higher chance of success than a book that has not been properly planned.  Before you even start writing you should make some notes about what you want the book to be about, what kinds of materials it should cover, and what order it will cover those materials in.

Before you start writing anything, your book should have a definition. What is the target audience? The scope? The depth? What language is the book going to use. All books on this project, English Wikibooks, need to be written in English. However, authors have some control over whether they want to use British or American English in their books. Once a book has decided on a dialect, all the pages in that book should use that dialect to help keep the book unified. Some authors may even choose to use a different subset of English, such as e-prime or BE-850. This is something the author should decide before writing.

Create an outline for your book, either here on Wikibooks, or on paper, or even in your head. Trust us when we say that the more planning you do now, the better your book will be in the future. Having to restructure a book later is typically a long and difficult process involving page moves and lots of editing to fix links. Try your hardest to do things right the first time, and the effort will pay off.

== Titles and Naming Conventions ==

We have a [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|Naming Policy]] that tries to keep all the books and book pages on Wikibooks organized in a standard way.  All book pages should have the name of the book as the prefix, followed by a forward slash, followed by the page name.  For example, &quot;My Book/My Page&quot; is correct, &quot;My Page&quot; is not.  Also keep in mind that other kinds of separators are not acceptable.  For instance, the following are not acceptable ways to name a page in a book:

 My Book:My Page
 My Book - My Page
 My Book &gt; My Page
 My Book My Page

The authors of a particular wikibook often describe the structure they prefer in a [[Help:Local_manuals_of_style|local manual of style]].

You have the decision about whether to make a book structure &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;deep&quot;. Neither is officially preferred. We will describe both of these structures below:

=== Flat Structure ===

If the book has a flat structure (without chapters) each page should be named as follows:
* Book_Title/Page_Name

In this structure, every page is one level away from the main page of the book. This makes links easier between pages, but it means that every page in your book must have a unique page name.

=== Deep Structure ===

If the book has a deep or &quot;hierarchical&quot; structure (with pages belonging to chapters) each page should be named as follows:
 Book_Title/Chapter_Name
 Book_Title/Chapter_Name/Page_Name

All pages belong to a chapter, and page names only need to be unique to the chapter, not the entire book. This is a good logical way to structure a book, but maintaining chapter pages can be tedious, and links need to be longer, which some editors might not like.

== Design Patterns ==


Developing books do not emerge fully-formed and in a perfect book shape. The process for creating a book can cause a book to take many forms which are not in themselves acceptable here at Wikibooks. However, so long as progress is continuous, various stages of books can not only be accepted here in the short-term, but also can be beneficial tools to book authors. 

Books are large projects, and it is generally not conceivable that an author will be able to write, to completion, one page at a time in a linear fashion. In fact, it should be assumed that most authors are only transient members here at Wikibooks, and that they could abandon their work here at any time. 

With this in mind, an author who wants to see their books succeed in the long-term should develop their book while attempting to maximize the ability for future authors to take over if the original author should leave suddenly. Books should start as a clear plan, such as a table of contents outline. From the outline, a page should progress to one of several intermediate forms. These intermediate forms allow a book to increase in size and information content rapidly, without needing to worry extensively about organization or formatting. After a book has expanded significantly in one of these intermediate forms, editors, revisers, and reviewers can polish the book to make it better and eventually make it a featured book. The general design pattern for a book that allows other authors to quickly and easily pick up where the original author left off is:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Outline &amp;rarr; Intermediate Form &amp;rarr; Book &amp;rarr; Featured Book&lt;/div&gt;

=== Warning About Intermediate Forms ===

Notice that intermediate forms are not considered stable or even acceptable books. If a book in an intermediate form is long abandoned, it runs a high risk of being deleted. Stubs are relatively well tolerated on Wikibooks, and a large portion of our community will resist deleting them unless they are in particularly bad shape. Macropedias are against policy, and unless a transwiki will significantly improve content at Wikipedia (which is unlikely), macropedias can be quickly deleted. Course-like books are better-tolerated than macropedias are, but they still run the risk of being transwikied to wikiversity if you don't pay close attention to them.

In short, bending some of our rules about content and structure can help a book to grow rapidly. However, these broken rules are not acceptable in the long-term. So long as a book is being actively edited and the authors realize that it needs to improve its form and structure in time, the editors at Wikibooks will be tolerant of it.

Below we will talk about various intermediate forms, and how to grow them into proper policy-compliant books.

=== Stubs ===

Stubs are a page, or several pages, with only a brief amount of starter text. This starter text can often explain what the page is going to cover, and provide a small amount of introductory text that other authors can help to expand. A &quot;good stub&quot; should:

#Explain clearly what the page will cover
#Provide a brief introduction to the topic
#Provide an organizational framework (named headings, for instance) to help show where information should go. 

Stubs that do not contain this information are likely to be more of a hindrance then a help to future authors, and should likely be deleted.

To grow a stub, there are two main options:
# Add more content, like in a '''content dump''' or import it like in a '''macropedia'''.
# Add more structure, by creating an '''outline'''.

=== Content Dumps ===

A content dump is where a large amount of material is added to a page in a disorganized way.  This is great to grow the size of a book quickly, but the content will need to be organized, ordered, and smoothed out if it's going to stay at Wikibooks for long.  Many books using this method become monolithic: lots of material on a single large page.  To grow these books, they should be separated into subpages, given a proper table of contents, and organized properly.

=== Outlines ===

Outlines are not necessarily stubs because they do not need to contain any content.  Outlines are a great way to plan and prepare a book, but a free-standing outline that has been long-abandoned by its original authors is generally not helpful or valuable.  Outlines are good to get one author started.  They are bad to get new authors interested.  If you write an outline and aren't around to work on it, it will probably be deleted.

The outline phase of a book should be brief. Outlines should quickly be filled with at least a base amount of content so that future authors and editors have some raw material to work with. Editors need content to fix and mold into shape. Authors need clear indicators where content should be located and improved.

To grow an outline, content should be added to each page in the list explaining what the page should cover. Then, each page can expand individually, following the given guidelines.

=== Macropedias ===

Pages at Wikibooks  can be seeded with articles imported from Wikipedia.  This can be a great way to take existing information on a topic, and grow the book quickly using existing free material.  Macropedias need to be extensively de-formatted (dewikified) before future authors can begin to contribute book-like content in a meaningful way.  This is because Wikipedia often uses a much more dense formatting style than Wikibooks does.

To grow a macropedia, you need to remove Wikipedia-only formatting and templates, and start converting the material into an instructional narrative.

=== Courses ===

During the progression of a school course, information can be written into the book as it is received in the class. Things like lecture notes, reading notes, assignments and their solutions, and other information received through a course can be uploaded as they are learned. Course-like materials do not need to be de-formatted like wikipedia articles need to be, but they often need to be restructured, organized, and edited extensively.

To grow a course-like book, material needs to be expanded beyond simple notes into narrative prose. It also needs to be organized into a logical way, since many classes do not always proceed through subject matter in a linear fashion.

=== Link List or Directory ===

A step up from an outline is a link list. Link lists are collections of links to other books, other wikis (such as Wikimedia Commons, Wikipedia, or Wikisource), or other places where information about the subject can be obtained. Link lists can be helpful in organizing resources and finding places to import raw material from, but they are also very dangerous. Link lists, &quot;Link farms&quot; or directories are a violation of [[WB:WIW|policy]], and they likely will be deleted if they do not evolve quickly. If you would like to maintain a list of resources for your own use, it is typically better to do it in your own userspace where many such content policies do not apply.

To grow a link list, go to each link, gather information from there, and bring it to Wikibooks. Once you've brought the necessary information here (such as in a content dump) you can delete the list, move it into a citation, or add it to a separate bibliography page.

== Page Header and Navigation Templates ==

One of the easiest ways to keep all the pages in a book linked together, and also to maintain a unified style between pages, is to use templates.  Some [[Wikibooks:Templates/Navigation|common templates]] are those at the top of the page (a page header template) and those at the bottom of the page (a page footer).  These templates typically provide a link back to the table of contents, and frequently also contain links to the previous page and the next page.</text>

== What Is a &quot;Wikibook&quot;? ==

Wikibooks is not a traditional book publishing medium, so it can't be expected that our books are going to fit the traditional definition of what a book is. A &quot;wikibook&quot; is a book written using a wiki. Here on Wikibooks, we restrict the kinds of books that can be hosted to instructional books, such as textbooks or manuals. Many other types of books do not belong here.

Wikibooks doesn't need to be like regular books. Here are some key differences:

;Length:Books on Wikibooks are not constrained by the length of a printed page. There is no predefined minimum nor maximum length to a book. Some books here will be unusually long, some will be unusually short. What is the most important is that the book contains the necessary information.
;Versions:A wikibook is a constantly evolving work, although there are some things that can be used to &quot;stabilize&quot; it too. In general, our books don't have fixed versions. However, our books can have PDF versions which remain relatively stable.
;Style:Many wikibooks tend to be similar in editorial style to traditional books, but they do not need to be. Wikibooks can make use of all the features of a web-based interface, including dynamic hyper-link navigation, and multimedia. A wikibook can also present information in a way that has never been done before.

=== How Much Work Does It Take? ===

Many people feel that writing a book is too big a task, and that it can be daunting to start a new book. However, writing a book does not need to be a big hassle. A little bit of advertising can help to attract other contributors, who can share the burden of creating a new book. You can advertise at Wikibooks (such as in the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]]), or you can advertise in other places. 

If you start writing the content, other people can come along and help you with the organizing and formatting. You can ask for help with formatting and organization from other experienced book authors at [[WB:RR|the Reading Room]].

Don't misunderstand: Writing a book at Wikibooks is a big deal. Books are big and daunting. However, wiki allows you to write portions at a time and to get help from other authors and editors. Before you start a new book project, seriously ask yourself if you have the time and energy to nurture it through the beginning stages of development, and help to attract and acclimate new editors to it over time. If you don't have these, your book may wither and die as an abandoned stub.

== Creating a New Book ==

If the book you want to write doesn't exist, why not create it? Anyone can create a new book so long as they are willing to contribute time to it and help it grow. However, there are certain policies and guidelines about what kinds of books you can and cannot write on Wikibooks. The complete policy is located at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].

The process of creating a new wikibook serves several purposes:

#Enables you, the contributor, to teach a subject that you know.
#Enables other readers to learn the subject, without having to pay the exorbitant prices of textbooks.
#Inspires other wikibookians to contribute to your book, making it a better resource.

It has been said that the best way to learn a subject is to teach it, and so the first point above really is a double-edged sword. Not only can you as the author help other people to learn the subject, but you yourself could gain a better understanding and appreciation for it. 

The second point above is another important one. Traditional printed textbooks are typically very expensive. On top of that is the fact that book publishers tend to create multiple editions of a book, one every couple of years. When a new edition of the book is released, the old versions become obsolete, even if they are more widely available, lower in price, and available used at a discount. Also, because wikibooks are available on the internet, books can be downloaded for free.

To do this, a good book needs several qualities:

#A good plan
#Solid infrastructure
#Sharp Focus
#Broad Scope

Without all these things, books will likely become either eternal stubs, candidates for a costly merger, or complete orphans. Here is some more detail on these points:

;A Good Plan:A book needs a '''plan''', a '''direction''', a '''purpose'''. We don't need to write books that aren't helpful and informative. We don't need to reinvent any wheels. The best books are going to start out as outlines or plans. One chapter is going to lead into another. The material will be presented in a comprehensible order. Books that are just collections of related information are known as &quot;macropedias&quot; and are not acceptable on Wikibooks. A good plan helps to ensure your book has a unified narrative throughout, to prevent it from becoming a macropedia.
;Solid Infrastructure:The book should have a good, solid infrastructure. Readers should be able to navigate the book with ease, and new contributors should know exactly what information should go where. The naming convention should be consistent. A book should also create the necessary custom templates that it needs and should also find and employ some other templates too. The MediaWiki software makes a good basis for this, and many helpful templates are available too.
;Sharp Focus:A book should have plenty of focus, and not be too broad or vague. A book titled &quot;Physics&quot; is probably not as good as a set of smaller, more defined books such as &quot;Statics&quot;, &quot;Dynamics&quot;, and &quot;Electromagnetic Waves&quot;. When readers come to your book they should know exactly what material it will contain. Another aspect of this is the fact that Wikibooks represents a complete library, in a sense: We already have books on the fundamentals of science, math, language, etc. Each new book does not need to cover the basics again and again. It is better to do one thing great than to do many things well. 
;Broad Scope:Every book needs to have a broad enough scope to cover the topic in full. A book such as &quot;Introduction to subject X&quot; can only cover, by definition, introductory material. By that same note &quot;Advanced Subject X&quot; by definition only covers those topics that can be considered &quot;advanced&quot;. A book about subject X should not artificially limit itself to only covering a certain aspect of subject X. A book on subject X should cover the whole thing. A good rule of thumb is to break up material into logical subtopics, and have every book cover an entire subtopic.

On a note of practicality, these requirements are also prerequisites for a book to become a [[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured Book]]. Gaining this distinction for your book will help it to expand and grow beyond what you can contribute yourself.

=== Is The Book Needed? ===

Hopefully your decision to create a new book will be mitigated by a specific need here at Wikibooks. Maybe it's a gaping hole in a particular bookshelf (&quot;I can't believe they have a mathematics bookshelf without calculus!&quot;), or maybe there are many smaller books on the subject that could be effectively merged into a new monolithic book. Also, before you create a new book here, it is a good idea to ensure that the book is actually right for Wikibooks:
*Is it allowed under policy? 
*Is Wikibooks the best wiki to host this material? 
*Will other people be able to contribute to it? 
*Will other readers be able to understand this subject? 
If the answer to all these questions is &quot;yes&quot;, Then you are well on your way to being able to start your project. 

=== Target Audience ===

Implicitly, if there is a need for your book, then there is somebody who needs it. This vague ''somebody'' is your '''target audience''', and is who you are writing your book for. Because you are writing a textbook, your target audience will most likely be school students. However, even under the banner of &quot;school students&quot; there are a number of different classifications that are worth considering. Students can be separated by age: young children (the target audience of Wikijunior), Highschool students, University Students, and Professionals (The target audience of [[Wikiprofessional]]). Some subjects are not conducive to certain target audience, in the same way that certain styles of writing are not good for a target audience. For instance, we aren't going to attempt to teach young children about &quot;SPARC Assembly Programming&quot;. We also aren't going to try and write a children's book using big words and complicated sentences.

Under the sub-heading of &quot;University Students&quot; also, there is a difference between different types of students. There is a distinct difference in the way a single subject can be taught between different groups of students: Statistics is taught differently between business majors (where it is taught predominantly using algebra), and mathematics students (where it is taught predominantly using calculus).

When considering this, there are multiple ways to go about creating a new book for your subject. Either you can make a book tailored specifically towards a single target audience (&quot;Statistics for Mathematicians&quot;), or you can make a single book (&quot;Statistics&quot;) That will consider the topic from multiple angles. For instance, you can separate the book into 2 distinct sections (one for business readers, and one for mathematics readers), or you can separate each individual page into the different sections (one section for the algebraic formulas and results, and a bottom section for the calculus derivations).

== Picking a Title ==

Picking a title is the first and arguably the most important task that a new author has. A good title will make a book easy to find and easy to remember. Long and complicated titles, ambiguous titles, or unspecific titles will have the opposite effect. Here are some general guidelines to get you started. Keep in mind that these are not hard and fast rules, and that many successful books have not followed these guidelines:

#Use a common name for your topic
#Avoid qualifiers such as &quot;Introduction to...&quot;, &quot;Advanced...&quot;, &quot;...For Beginners&quot;, etc. You may need qualifiers if there are other books on your subject, however.
#Don't name a book after a particular school course
#Don't give your book a subtitle. If you do, include the subtitle on the cover, not in the link to the book.
#Don't number books sequentially.

== How to Start a New Book ==

To actually create a new book you must first create a new page. Go to [[Help:Pages#Creating]] and create a new page following the directions provided. 

It is important to make sure that your title is unique and follows proper [[Wikibooks:NP|naming conventions]]. Type the title of the book into the search box on the top right side of the screen and click on the magnifying glass icon. If a book with that name already exists, you can either pick a new title for your book, or else attempt to contribute to the existing book.

Book names should use '''title case'''. Title case is where the first letters of the important words are capitalized. There is no policy on this, it's just a good suggestion. Here are some examples:

*&quot;This is a Good Book Title&quot; (title case)
*&quot;This is a bad book title&quot; (sentence case)

The first letter of the book title is always capitalized by the software. 

=== The Landing Page ===

After you create a new page you will be directed to a new blank page which is called the ''landing page''. When a new reader comes to your book, the landing page is the first page they see. The landing page is also where cleanup templates and organizational templates for your book are placed.

There are two schools of thought when it comes to landing pages:

# The landing page should be a cover page, with a link to the table of contents. This follows a printed book metaphor where you see the cover of a book first, and have to turn to the Table of Contents.
# The landing page is the table of contents, with a link to an optional cover page and links to all the pages in the book. This is more of a web-oriented structure that can be easier to navigate but not always as aesthetically pleasing.

Wikibooks does not mandate that either of these methods be used before the other. However, option #2 tends to be the more popular one. Notice that all books really need a table of contents to stay organized and link to all the sub-pages in the book. However books don't all need cover pages, and many books do not have them.

=== The Table of Contents ===

The table of contents is important for a number of reasons:

;For Readers: The table of contents lists all the pages in the book, and shows the intended reading order of them. If material in the book builds logically from one chapter to the next, then the pages should be read in the given order.
;For Authors: The table of contents serves as an organizational outline, showing which material should be placed where and in what order. This is especially valuable when the book is first created, because the table of contents acts like a type of &quot;to do list&quot; to show which pages have not yet been written.

The most basic table of contents has a list of all pages in the book, one on each line such as in a bullet list. More advanced tables of contents can break groups of pages into named sections, and contain links to related books and book metadata.

== Find an Example ==

Sometimes you can start off on your own book with no help and do perfectly well. Often, however, you will want to model your book's format and organization on established books. Some examples of well-established books that have been successful are [[WB:FB|Featured Books]]. You can  use these books as good models for your new book.

== Hijacking Redirects ==

A good writer will attempt to anticipate what readers will be searching for. For instance, a reader is more likely to type &quot;Animals&quot; into the search box than to type &quot;An Introduction to Various Animals&quot;. This insight should play a role when you title your book, because you want your book to have a title that readers will be able to find.

Sometimes a book will have many Aliases. That is, sometimes there are many common terms that refer to the material in a book. A common example of this is an acronym of the book's title. If nobody else is using those pages, make them into redirects to your book. That way when a person searches for &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;Critters&quot;, or &quot;Creatures&quot;, they can all be taken directly to your book.

== Donating an Existing Book ==

Frequently authors have books already written that they would like to donate to Wikibooks. If you are willing to release your book under the terms of the [[GFDL]] license, and if your book meets our [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]], then you might be able to donate the book to Wikibooks. We've set up a guideline to help with the donation process at [[WB:DONATE]]. We'll also cover book donations in a later chapter of this book.

People who are interested in donating books should read the entire donations page, as well as the text of the [[GFDL]] license before taking any action.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Extendable Ears''''' are inventions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]]. They look like long, flesh-colored threads; you insert one end into your ear, and can hear what is happening at the other end of the thread.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear that Fred and George have been trying to hear meetings of the Order of the Phoenix using Extendable Ears, and have not been having terribly much in the way of success; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|their mother]] had tried to destroy their entire stock but had missed a few, and lately had been placing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperturbable Charm|Imperturbable Charm]]s on the doors to the meeting rooms, so that the ends of the Ears cannot get inside. We see the twins attempting to eavesdrop on some of the order members departing after a meeting, but they leave the entrance hall too quickly.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] is in the hospital following the snake attack, he, Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] have a quick meeting where they try to figure out how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] could have perceived the attack. Harry, Fred, George, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] eavesdrop on this conference using Extendable Ears, and hear that the Order believes that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] may be possessing Harry.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry, Ron, and Hermione trail [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]], a Dark magic store in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. There, they use Extendable Ears to hear what Draco is saying to the store clerk.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who are currently moving from point to point around the countryside, happen to be near another party of Magical refugees. They are unable to hear what this other party is saying because of the protective spells that Hermione has cast around the tent, but Hermione provides Extendable Ears, and they all listen to the conversation of the other group. Presumably, the active end of the Ears is outside the area of the protective spells.

== Analysis ==

In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', it is interesting that the listening ends of the Ears can travel to the area outside the protective spells without being physically pushed there – it seems that Hermione does not even have to leave the tent. It appears that unlike normal threads, the outside ends of the Ears are motile; there is some way to tell them a direction in which to travel to find the thing you are interested in hearing.

This northern Italian meat sauce, or Ragu Bolognese is wonderful on [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] with freshly grated [[Cookbook:Cheese|Parmesan cheese]], or as filling for lasagne. 

==Ingredients==
*¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (125 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] or [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], cut into cubes
*1 lb. (450 g) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] lean or medium ground 
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (225 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*¼ cup (50 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*¼ cup (50 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
*¼ cup (50 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] bulb, if available
*¼ cup (50 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*1 cup (225 ml) canned plum [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
*½ cup (125 ml) red [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*2 cups (500 ml) beef stock (preferably fresh, but canned beef stock will do)
*¼ cup (50 ml) [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*1 strip of [[Cookbook:lemon rind|lemon rind]] 
*1 [[cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1 lb. (450 g) spaghetti pasta, preferably made from durum wheat
*1 cup Parmesan cheese for garnish, preferably freshly grated Reggiano Parmesan 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and fresh ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Mix the coarsely chopped onion, carrot, celery and fennel (optional) together and finely chop them (this is called a battuto in Italian, or a finely chopped mixture of vegetables and herbs to flavour a dish)
#Cut the ham or bacon into little cubes and saute in a heavy sauce pan
#Add the butter and allow it to melt. Then add the battuto
#Cook, stirring occasionally until very lightly browned
#Add this mixture to a heavy pot 
#Heat the olive oil in the skillet the battuto was browned in and when the oil is hot, add the beef and stir to break up lumps, cooking until well browned
#Add to the battuto in the pot
#Add the wine to the skillet the beef was in and stir on high heat, scraping any brown bits stuck to the pan
#Add the tomato paste and stock and stir until well mixed and add this mixture to the pot
#Drain and coarsely chop the plum tomatoes and add them to the pot
#Add the bay leaf and lemon rind
#Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer, with bubbles barely breaking the surface
#Simmer, stirring occasionally for an hour (or more), until thick
#Add pepper to taste, and salt if necessary to taste
#When the sauce is ready, bring a gallon (4 litres) of water to a full boil over high heat in a large pot
#Add the pasta, give it a brisk stir to ensure it is all covered by water and not clumped together.  Cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until [[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]] (firm but not hard, there should still be a bit of 'bite' when chewing pasta, rather than soggy and mushy)
#Drain the pasta well and serve immediately
#Remove the bay leaf and lemon rind, then spoon the Bolognese sauce over the pasta and have guests garnish with the grated Parmesan cheese.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* This is a great recipe for making in large quantities and freezing.  I have made up to 20 times the recipe and frozen in four-cup (1 litre) servings for our family so we can enjoy the pasta sauce over and over without having to start from scratch each time.  If making bulk recipes, be sure to simmer for hours, or even a full day, occasionally stirring up from the bottom of the large pot to ensure the contents at the bottom does not burn, adding stock as needed to keep the right consistency.  The goal is to have the flavours mix and make the home smell delicious!
*Never rinse pasta with water.  To ensure there is no excess starch from the pasta, choose a high quality durum wheat pasta and boil it in lots of water.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How do I determine the max range ?

*Fully charge the van.
*Decide on a reasonably cruising speed (slower = longer range, I used 40 mph).
*Then find a circuit (so the hills even out) e.g. about 10 miles.
*Clear the trip counter and note the energy remaining.
*Drive around the circuit and repeat the circuit until you cant do another circuit but can still get home. At each 10% point note the current mileage. Use minimum throttle all the time (best to keep in the green if you can).


How do I drive near the range limit ?
*Make sure that you can actually achieve the range that you want from spreadsheet calculated from &quot;Determining the max range&quot; above. (Note that rain reduce your range by 10-15%)
*Plan your route and calculate the expected remaining charge at regular points on the trip (e.g. village1 is 5 miles away which will use 10% so 90% should be remaining).
*Start off with the derived estimated speed. At each point change your average speed (if required) dependent on the following
**you have used more that the estimated energy then you need to slow down (e.g. by 5 mph)
**you have used about the correct amount then keep going at that average speed.
**you have used less than the estimate energy, then only if you are in a hurry you can pick a little on the speed (e.g. by 5 mph)
*This process will take account of all the factors that can affect your range, e.g.
**rain
**speed
**wind
**rolling resistance

&lt;!--
To increase the accuracy of the results hills need to be taken into account.

Determine the total height gain of most of the hills (e.g. 75%) (e.g. using a terrain profile service such as http://www.heywhatsthat.com)

Determine the total number of stops from your preffered routing software (e.g. www.multimap.com)

Enter the information into the spreadsheet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

No matter which public topic you discuss or which personal aspect you worry about – you need reasons for your opinion and argumentation. Moreover, the ability of reasoning is responsible for your cognitive features of decision making and choosing among alternatives.

Everyone of us uses these two abilities in everyday life to the utmost. Let us, therefore, consider the following scene of Knut's life:

''“It is again a rainy afternoon in Osnabrück (Germany) and as Knut and his wife are tired of observing the black crows in their garden they decide to escape from the shabby weather and spend their holidays in Spain. Knut has never been to Spain before and is pretty excited. They will leave the next day, thus he is packing his bag. The crucial things first: some underwear, some socks, a pair of pyjamas and his wash bag with a toothbrush, shampoo, soap, sun milk and insect spray. But, Knut cannot find the insect spray until his wife tells him that she lost it and will buy some new. He advises her to take an umbrella for the way to the chemist as it is raining outside, before he turns back to his packing task. But what did he already pack into his bag? Immediately, he remembers and continues, packing his clothing into the bag, considering that each piece fits another one and finally his Ipod as he exclusively listens to music with this device. Since the two of them are going on summer holidays, Knut packs especially shorts and T-Shirts into his bag. After approximately half an hour, he is finally convinced that he has done everything necessary for having some fine holidays.”''

With regard to this sketch of Knut's holiday preparation, we will explain the basic principles of reasoning and decision making. In the following, it will be shown how much cognitive work is necessary for this fragment of everyday life.
After presenting an insight into the topic, we will illustrate what kind of brain lesions lead to what kind of impairments of these two cognitive features.

== Reasoning ==

In a process of reasoning available information is taken into account in form of [[Wikipedia:premise (argument)|premises]]. Through a process of inferencing a [[Wikipedia:conclusion|conclusion]] is reached on the base of these premises. The conclusion’s content of information goes beyond the one of the premises. To make this clear consider the following consideration Knut makes before planning his holiday:

  '''1. Premise: In all countries in southern Europe it is pretty warm during summer.'''
  '''2. Premise: Spain is in southern Europe.'''
  '''Conclusion: Therefore, in Spain it is pretty warm during summer.''' 

The conclusion in this example follows directly from the premises but it entails information which is not explicitly stated in the premises. This is a rather typical feature of a process of reasoning. In the following it is decided between the two major kinds of reasoning, namely '''inductive''' and '''deductive''' which are often seen as the complement of one another. 


=== Deductive reasoning ===

[[Wikipedia:Deductive reasoning|Deductive reasoning]] is concerned with [[Wikipedia:Syllogism|syllogisms]] in which the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The following example about Knut makes this process clear:

  '''1.Premise: Knut knows: If it is warm, one needs shorts and T-Shirts.'''
  '''2.Premise: He also knows that it is warm in Spain during summer.'''
  '''Conclusion: Therefore, Knut reasons that he needs shorts and T-Shirts in Spain.'''

In the given example it is obvious that the premises are about rather general information and the resulting conclusion is about a more special case which can be inferred from the two premises.

Hereafter it is differentiated between the two major kinds of syllogisms, namely categorical and conditional ones. 

==== Categorical syllogisms ====

In categorical syllogisms the statements of the premises begin typically with “all”, “none” or “some” and the conclusion starts with “therefore” or “hence”. These kinds of syllogisms fulfill the task of describing a relationship between two categories. In the example given above in the introduction of deductive reasoning these categories are ''Spain'' and ''the need for shorts and T-Shirts''. Two different approaches serve the study of categorical syllogisms which are the '''normative approach''' and the '''descriptive approach'''.

===== The normative approach =====

The normative approach is based on logic and deals with the problem of categorizing conclusions as either valid or invalid. “Valid” means that the conclusion follows logically from the premises whereas “invalid” means the contrary. Two basic principles and a method called '''Euler Circles''' (Figure 1) have been developed to help judging about the [[Wikipedia:Validity|validity]]. The first principle was created by Aristotle and says “If the two premises are true, the conclusion of a valid syllogism must be true” (cp. Goldstein, 2005). The second principle describes that “The validity of a syllogism is determined only by its form, not its content.” These two principles explain why the following syllogism is (surprisingly) valid:

  '''All flowers are animals. All animals can jump. Therefore, all flowers can jump.'''

Even though it is quite obvious that the first premise is not true and further that the conclusion is not true, the whole syllogism is still valid. Applying formal logic to the syllogism in the example, the conclusion is valid.

[[Image:eulercircles.jpg|500px]]

''Figure 1, Euler Circles''


Due to this precondition it is possible to display a syllogism formally with symbols or letters and explain its relationship graphically with the help of diagrams. There are various ways to demonstrate a premise graphically. Starting with a circle to represent the first premise and adding one or more circles for the second one (Figure 1), the crucial move is to compare the constructed diagrams with the conclusion. It should be clearly laid out whether the diagrams are contradictory or not. Agreeing with one another, the syllogism is valid.
The displayed syllogism (Figure 1) is obviously valid. The conclusion shows that everything that can jump contains animals which again contains flowers. This agrees with the two premises which point out that flowers are animals and that these are able to jump. The method of Euler Circles is a good device to make syllogisms better conceivable.

===== The descriptive approach =====

The descriptive approach is concerned with estimating people´s ability of judging validity and explaining judging errors. This psychological approach uses two methods in order to determine people`s performance:

 '''Method of evaluation''': People are given two premises, a conclusion and the task to judge whether the syllogism is valid or not.
                       (preferred one)
 '''Method of production''': Participants are supplied with two premises and asked to develop a logically valid conclusion.
                       (if possible)

While using the '''method of evaluation''' researchers found typical misjudgments about syllogisms. Premises starting with “All”, “Some” or “No” imply a special atmosphere and influence a person in the process of decision making. One mistake often occurring is judging a syllogism incorrectly as valid, in which the two premises as well as the conclusion starts with “All”. The influence of the provided atmosphere leads to the right decision at most times, but is definitely not reliable and guides the person to a rash decision. This phenomenon is called the '''atmosphere effect'''.

In addition to the form of a syllogism, the content is likely to influence a person’s decision as well and causes the person to neglect his logical thinking. The [[Wikipedia:Belief bias|belief bias]] states that people tend to judge syllogisms with believable conclusions as valid, while they tend to judge syllogisms with unbelievable conclusions as invalid. Given a conclusion as like “Some bananas are pink”, hardly any participants would judge the syllogism as valid, even though it might be valid according to its premises (e.g. Some bananas are fruits. All fruits are pink.)

===== Mental models of deductive reasoning =====

It is still not possible to consider what mental processes might occur when people are trying to determine whether a syllogism is valid. After researchers observed that Euler Circles can be used to determine the validity of a syllogism, Phillip Johnson–Laird (1999) wondered whether people would use such circles naturally without any instruction how to use them. At the same time he found out that they do not work for some more complex syllogisms and that a problem can be solved by applying logical rules, but most people solve them by imagining the situation. This is the basic idea of people using mental models – a specific situation that is represented in a person’s mind that can be used to help determine the validity of syllogisms – to solve deductive reasoning problems. The basic principle behind the Mental Model Theory is: A conclusion is valid only if it cannot be refuted by any mode of the premises. This theory is rather popular because it makes predictions that can be tested and because it can be applied without any knowledge about rules of logic. But there are still problems facing researchers when trying to determine how people reason about syllogisms. These problems include the fact that a variety of different strategies are used by people in reasoning and that some people are better in solving syllogisms than others.

===== Effects of culture on deductive reasoning =====

People can be influenced by the content of syllogisms rather than by focusing on logic when judging their validity. Psychologists have wondered whether people are influenced by their cultures when judging. Therefore they have done cross–cultural experiments in which reasoning problems were presented to people of different cultures. They observed that people from different cultures judge differently to these problems. People use evidence from their own experience (empirical evidence) and ignore evidence presented in the syllogism (theoretical evidence).

==== Conditional syllogisms ====

Another type of syllogisms is called “conditional syllogism”. Just like the categorical one, it also has two premises and a conclusion. In difference the first premise has the form “If … then”. Syllogisms like this one are common in everyday life. Consider the following example from the story about Knut:

  '''1. Premise: If it is raining, Knut`s wife gets wet.'''
  '''2. Premise: It is raining.'''
  '''Conclusion: Therefore, Knut`s wife gets wet.'''

Conditional syllogisms are typically given in the abstract form: “If p then q”, where “p” is called the '''antecedent''' and “q” the '''consequent'''.

===== Forms of conditional syllogisms =====

There are four major forms of conditional syllogisms, namely '''Modus Ponens''', '''Modus Tollens''', '''Denying The Antecedent''' and '''Affirming The Consequent'''. These are illustrated in the table below (Figure 2) by means of the conditional syllogism above (i.e. If it is raining, Knut`s wife gets wet). The table indicates the premises, the resulting conclusions and it shows whether these are valid or not. The lowermost row displays the relative number of correct judgements people make about the validity of the conclusions.

[[Image:syllo.jpg|thumb|800px|''Figure 2, Different kinds of conditional syllogisms '']]

Obviously, the validity of the syllogisms with valid conclusions is easier to judge in a correct manner than the validity of the ones with invalid conclusions. The conclusion in the instance of the modus ponens is apparently valid. In the example it is very clear that Knut`s wife gets wet, if it is raining.
 
The validity of the modus tollens is more difficult to recognize. Referring to the example, in the case that Knut`s wife does not get wet it can`t be raining. Because the first premise says that if it is raining, she gets wet. So the reason for Knut`s wife not getting wet is that it is not raining. Consequently, the conclusion is valid.

The validity of the remaining two kinds of conditional syllogisms is judged correctly only by 40% of people. If the method of denying the antecedent is applied, the second premise says that it is not raining. But from this fact it follows not logically that Knut`s wife does not get wet – obviously rain is not the only reason for her to get wet. It could also be the case that the sun is shining and Knut tests his new water pistol and makes her wet. So, this kind of conditional syllogism does not lead to a valid conclusion.

Affirming the consequent in the case of the given example means that the second premise says that Knut`s wife gets wet. But again the reason for this can be circumstances apart from rain. So, it follows not logically that it is raining. In consequence, the conclusion of this syllogism is invalid.

The four kinds of syllogisms have shown that it is not always easy to make correct judgments concerning the validity of the conclusions. The following passages will deal with other errors people make during the process of conditional reasoning.

===== The Wason Selection Task =====

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task Wason Selection Task] is a famous experiment which shows that people make more errors in the process of reasoning, if it is concerned with abstract items than if it involves real-world items (Wason, 1966).

In the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task four cards are shown to the participants with each a letter on one side and a number on the other (Figure 3, yellow cards). The task is to indicate the minimum number of cards that have to be turned over to test whether the following rule is observed: “If there is a vowel on one side then there is an even number on the other side”. 53% of participants selected the ‘E’ card which is correct, because turning this card over is necessary for testing the truth of the rule. However still another card needs to be turned over. 64 % indicated that the ‘4’ card has to be turned over which is not right. Only 4% of participants answered correctly that the ‘7’ card needs to be turned over in addition to the ‘E’. The correctness of turning over these two cards becomes more obvious if the same task is stated in terms of real-world items instead of vowels and numbers.
One of the experiments for determining this was the beer/drinking-age problem used by Richard Griggs and James Cox (1982). This experiment is identical to the Wason Selection Task except that instead of numbers and letters on the cards everyday terms (beer, soda and ages) were used (Figure 3, green cards). Griggs and Cox gave the following rule to the participants: “If a person is drinking beer then he or she must be older than 19 years.” In this case 73% of participants answered in a correct way, namely that the cards with “Beer” and “14 years” on it have to be turned over to test whether the rule is kept.

[[Image:wason1.jpg|thumb|400px|''Figure 3, The Wason Selection Task '']]

'''Why is the performance better in the case of real–world items?'''

There are two different approaches which explain why participants’ performance is significantly better in the case of  the beer/drinking-age problem than in the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task, namely one approach concerning permission schemas and an evolutionary approach.
 
The regulation: “If one is 19 years or older then he/she is allowed to drink alcohol”, is known by everyone as an experience from everyday life (also called '''permission schema'''). As this permission schema is already learned by the participants it can be applied to the Wason Selection Task for real–world items to improve participants` performance. On the contrary such a permission schema from everyday life does not exist for the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task.
 
The evolutionary approach concerns the important human ability of '''cheater-detection''' . This approach states that an important aspect of human behaviour especially in the past was/is the ability for two persons to cooperate in a way that is beneficial for both of them. As long as each person receives a benefit for whatever he/she does in favour of the other one, everything works well in their social exchange. But if someone cheats and receives benefit from others without giving it back, some problem arises (see also chapter [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Evolutionary_Perspective_on_Social_Cognitions 3. Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions]). It is assumed that the property to detect cheaters has become a part of human`s cognitive makeup during evolution. This cognitive ability improves the performance in the beer/drinking-age version of the Wason Selection Task as it allows people to detect a cheating person who does not behave according to the rule. Cheater-detection does not work in the case of the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task as vowels and numbers do not behave or even cheat at all as opposed to human beings.

=== Inductive reasoning ===

In the previous sections deductive reasoning was discussed, reaching conclusions based on logical rules applied to a set of premises.
However, many problems cannot be represented in a way that would make it possible to use these rules to get a conclusion. This subchapter is about a way to be able to decide in terms of these problems as well: [[Wikipedia:inductive reasoning|inductive reasoning]].

[[Image:reasoning.jpg|thumb|300px|''Figure 4, Deductive and inductive reasoning '']]

Inductive reasoning is the process of making simple observations of a certain kind and applying these observations via generalization to a different problem to make a decision. Hence one infers from a special case to the general principle which is just the opposite of the procedure of deductive reasoning (Figure 4). A good example for inductive reasoning is the following:

  '''Premise: All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are black.'''
  '''Conclusion: Therefore, they reason that all crows on earth are black.'''

In this example it is obvious that Knut and his wife infer from the simple observation about the crows they have seen to the general principle about all crows. Considering figure 5 this means that they infer from the subset (yellow circle) to the whole (blue circle). As in this example it is typical in a process of inductive reasoning that the premises are believed to support the conclusion, but do not ensure it.

[[Image:crows.jpg|300px]]

''Figure 5 ''

==== Forms of inductive reasoning ====

The two different forms of inductive reasoning are &quot;'''strong'''&quot; and &quot;'''weak'''&quot; induction.
The former describes that the truth of the conclusion is very likely, if the assumed premises are true. An example for this form of reasoning is the one given in the previous section. In this case it is obvious that the premise (&quot;All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are black&quot;) gives good evidence for the conclusion (&quot;All crows on earth are black&quot;) to be true. But nevertheless it is still possible, although very unlikely, that not all crows are black.

On the contrary, conclusions reached by &quot;weak induction&quot; are supported by the premises in a rather weak manner. In this approach the truth of the premises makes the truth of the conclusion possible, but not likely. An example for this kind of reasoning is the following:

  '''Premise: Knut always hears music with his IPod.'''
  '''Conclusion: Therefore, he reasons that all music is only heard with IPods.'''

In this instance the conclusion is obviously false. The information the premise contains is not very representative and although it is true, it does not give decisive evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  

To sum it up, strong inductive reasoning gets to conclusions which are very probable whereas the conclusions reached through weak inductive reasoning on the base of the premises are unlikely to be true.

==== Reliability of conclusions ====

If the strength of the conclusion of an inductive argument has to be determined, three factors concerning the premises play a decisive role. The following example which refers to Knut and his wife and the observations they made about the crows (see previous sections) displays these factors:

When Knut and his wife observe in addition to the black crows in Germany also the crows in Spain, the '''number of observations''' they make concerning the crows obviously increases. Furthermore, the '''representativeness of these observations''' is supported, if Knut and his wife observe the crows at all different day- and nighttimes and see that they are black every time. Theoretically it may be that the crows change their colour at night what would make the conclusion that all crows are black wrong. The '''quality of the evidence''' for all crows to be black increases, if Knut and his wife add scientific measurements which support the conclusion. For example they could find out that the crows' genes determine that the only colour they can have is black.

Conclusions reached through a process of inductive reasoning are never definitely true as no one has seen all crows on earth and as it is possible, although very unlikely, that there is a green or brown exemplar. The three mentioned factors contribute decisively to the strength of an inductive argument. So, the stronger these factors are, the more reliable are the conclusions reached through induction.

==== Processes and constraints ====

In a process of inductive reasoning people often make use of certain heuristics which lead in many cases quickly to adequate conclusions but sometimes may cause errors. In the following, two of these heuristics ('''availability heuristic''' and '''representativeness heuristic''') are explained. Subsequently, the '''confirmation bias''' is introduced which sometimes influences people's reasons according to their own opinion without them realising it.

'''The availability heuristic'''

Things that are more easily remembered are judged to be more prevalent. An example for this is an experiment done by Lichtenstein et al. (1978). The participants were asked to choose from two different lists the causes of death which occur more often. Because of the availability heuristic people judged more “spectacular” causes like homicide or tornado to cause more deaths than others, like asthma.
The reason for the subjects answering in such a way is that for example films and news in television are very often about spectacular and interesting causes of death. This is why these information are much more available to the subjects in the experiment.
  
Another effect of the usage of the availability heuristic is called '''illusory correlations'''. People tend to judge according to stereotypes. It seems to them that there are correlations between certain events which in reality do not exist. This is what is known by the term “prejudice”. It means that a much oversimplified generalization about a group of people is made. Usually a correlation seems to exist between negative features and a certain class of people (often fringe groups). 
If, for example, one's neighbour is jobless and very lazy one tends to correlate these two attributes and to create the prejudice that all jobless people are lazy. This illusory correlation occurs because one takes into account information which is available and judges this to be prevalent in many cases.

'''The representativeness heuristic'''

If people have to judge the probability of an event they try to find a comparable event and assume that the two events have a similar probability.
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974) presented the following task to their participants in an experiment: “We randomly chose a man from the population of the U.S., Robert, who wears glasses, speaks quietly and reads a lot. Is it more likely that he is a librarian or a farmer?” 
More of the participants answered that Robert is a librarian which is an effect of the representativeness heuristic. The comparable event which the participants chose was the one of a typical librarian as Robert with his attributes of speaking quietly and wearing glasses resembles this event more than the event of a typical farmer. So, the event of a typical librarian is better comparable with Robert than the event of a typical farmer.
Of course this effect may lead to errors as Robert is randomly chosen from the population and as it is perfectly possible that he is a farmer although he speaks quietly and wears glasses.
[[Image:feminist bank teller.jpg|thumb|500px|''Figure 6, Feminist bank tellers'']] 
The representativeness heuristic also leads to errors in reasoning in cases where the '''conjunction rule''' is violated. This rule states that the conjunction of two events is never more likely to be the case than the single events alone. An example for this is the case of the feminist bank teller (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1983). If we are introduced to a woman of whom we know that she is very interested in women’s rights and has participated in many political activities in college and we are to decide whether it is more likely that she is a bank teller or a feminist bank teller, we are drawn to conclude the latter as the facts we have learnt about her resemble the event of a feminist bank teller more than the event of only being a bank teller.

But it is in fact much more likely that somebody is just a bank teller than it is that someone is a feminist in addition to being a bank teller. This effect is illustrated in figure 6 where the green square, which stands for just being a bank teller, is much larger and thus more probable than the smaller violet square, which displays the conjunction of bank tellers and feminists, which is a subset of bank tellers.

'''The confirmation bias'''

This phenomenon describes the fact that people tend to decide in terms of what they themselves believe to be true or good. If, for example, someone believes that one has bad luck on Friday the thirteenth, he will especially look for every negative happening at this particular date but will be inattentive to negative happenings on other days. This behaviour strengthens the belief that there exists a relationship between Friday the thirteenth and having bad luck. This example shows that the actual information is not taken into account to come to a conclusion but only the information which supports one's own belief.
This effect leads to errors as people tend to reason in a subjective manner, if personal interests and beliefs are involved.  

All the mentioned factors influence the subjective probability of an event so that it differs from the actual probability ('''probability heuristic''').
Of course all of these factors do not always appear alone, but they influence one another and can occur in combination during the process of reasoning.

==== Why inductive reasoning at all? ====

All the described constraints show how prone to errors inductive reasoning is and so the question arises, why we use it at all?
 
But inductive reasons are important nevertheless because they act as shortcuts for our reasoning. It is much easier and faster to apply the availability heuristic or the representativeness heuristic to a problem than to take into account all information concerning the current topic and draw a conclusion by using logical rules.
 
In the following excerpt of very usual actions there is a lot of inductive reasoning involved although one does not realize it on the first view. It points out the importance of this cognitive ability:

''The sunrise every morning and the sunset in the evening, the change of seasons, the TV program, the fact that a chair does not collapse when we sit on it or the light bulb that flashes after we have pushed a button.''
 
All of these cases are conclusions derived from processes of inductive reasoning. Accordingly, one assumes that the chair one is sitting on does not collapse as the chairs on which one sat before did not collapse. This does not ensure that the chair does not break into pieces but nevertheless it is a rather helpful conclusion to assume that the chair remains stable as this is very probable. To sum it up, inductive reasoning is rather advantageous in situations where deductive reasoning is just not applicable because only evidence but no proved facts are available. As these situations occur rather often in everyday life, living without the use of inductive reasoning is inconceivable.

'''Induction vs. deduction'''

The table below (Figure 7) summarises the most prevalent properties and differences between deductive and inductive reasoning which are important to keep in mind.

[[Image:invsde.jpg]]

''Figure 7, Induction vs. deduction ''

== Decision making ==

According to the different levels of consequences, each process of making a decision requires appropriate effort and various aspects to be considered.  The following excerpt from the story about Knut makes this obvious:
“After considering facts like the warm weather in Spain and shirts and shorts being much more comfortable in this case (information gathering and likelihood estimation) Knut reasons that he needs them for his vacation. In consequence, he finally makes the decision to pack mainly shirts and shorts in his bag (final act of choosing).”
Now it seems like there cannot be any decision making without previous reasoning, but that is not true. Of course there are situations in which someone decides to do something spontaneously, with no time to reason about it. We will not go into detail here but you might think about questions like ''&quot;Why do we choose one or another option in that case?&quot;''

=== Choosing among alternatives ===

The psychological process of [[Wikipedia: Decision making|decision making]] constantly goes along with situations in daily life. Thinking about Knut again we can imagine him to decide between packing more blue or more green shirts for his vacation (which would only have minor consequences) but also about applying a specific job or having children with his wife (which would have relevant influence on important circumstances of his future life). The mentioned examples are both characterized by personal decisions, whereas professional decisions, dealing for example with economic or political issues, are just as important.

==== The utility approach ====
[[Image:value.png|frame|''Figure 8, Relation between (monetary) gains/losses and their subjective value'']]

There are three different ways to analyze decision making. The normative approach assumes a rational decision-maker with well-defined preferences. While the rational choice theory is based on a priori considerations, the descriptive approach is based on empirical observations and on experimental studies of choice behavior. The prescriptive enterprise develops methods in order to improve decision making.
According to Manktelow and Reber´s definition, “utility refers to outcomes that are desirable because they are in the person’s best interest” (Reber, A. S., 1995; Manktelow, K., 1999). This normative/descriptive approach characterizes optimal decision making by the maximum expected utility in terms of monetary value. This approach can be helpful in gambling theories, but simultaneously includes several disadvantages. People do not necessarily focus on the monetary payoff, since they find value in things other than money, such as fun, free time, family, health and others. But that is not a big problem, because it is possible to apply the graph (Figure 8), which shows the relation between (monetary) gains/losses and their subjective value / utility, which is equal to all the valuable things mentioned above. Therefore, not choosing the maximal monetary value does not automatically describe an irrational decision process.

==== Misleading effects ====

But even respecting the considerations above there might still be problems to make the “right” decision because of different misleading effects, which mainly arise because of the constraints of inductive reasoning. In general this means that our model of a situation/problem might not be ideal to solve it in an optimal way. The following three points are typical examples for such effects.

'''Subjective models'''

This effect is rather equal to the illusory correlations mentioned before in the part about the constraints of inductive reasoning. It is about the problem that models which people create might be misleading, since they rely on subjective speculations. An example could be deciding where to move by considering typical prejudices of the countries (e.g. always good pizza, nice weather and a relaxed life-style in Italy in contrast to some kind of boring food and steady rain in Great Britain). The predicted events are not equal to the events occurring indeed.
(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1982; Dunning &amp; Parpal, 1989)

'''Focusing illusion'''

Another misleading effect is the so-called '''focusing illusion'''.  By considering only the most obvious aspects in order to make a  certain decision (e.g. the weather) people often neglect various really important outcomes (e.g. circumstances at work). This effect occurs more often, if people judge about others compared with judgments about their own living.

'''Framing effect'''

A problem can be described in different ways and therefore evoke different decision strategies. If a problem is specified in terms of gains, people tend to use a risk-aversion strategy, while a problem description in terms of losses leads to apply a risk-taking strategy.
An example of the same problem and predictably different choices is the following experiment:
A group of people is asked to imagine themselves $300 richer than they are, is confronted with the choice of a sure gain of $100 or an equal chance to gain $200 or nothing. Most people avoid the risk and take the sure gain, which means they take the risk-aversion strategy. 
Alternatively if people are asked to assume themselves to be $500 richer than in reality, given the options of a sure loss of $100 or an equal chance to lose $200 or nothing, the majority opts for the risk of losing $200 by taking the risk seeking or risk-taking strategy. This phenomenon is known as '''framing effect''' and can also be illustrated by figure 8 above, which is a concave function for gains and a convex one for losses.
(''Foundations of Cognitive Psychology'', Levitin, D. J., 2002)

==== Justification in decision making ====

Decision making often includes the need to assign a reason for the decision and therefore justify it. This factor is illustrated by an experiment by A. Tversky and E. Shafir (1992):
A very attractive vacation package has been offered to a group of students who have just passed an exam and to another group of students who have just failed the exam and have the chance to rewrite it after the holidays coming up. All students have the options to buy the ticket straight away, to stay at home, or to pay $5 for keeping the option open to buy it later.
At this point, there is no difference between the two groups, since the number of students who passed the exam and decided to book the flight (with the justification of a deserving a reward), is the same as the number of students who failed and booked the flight (justified as consolation and having time for reoccupation).
A third group of students who were informed to receive their results in two more days was confronted with the same problem. The majority decided to pay $5 and keep the option open until they would get their results.
The conclusion now is that even though the actual exam result does not influence the decision, it is required in order to provide a rationale.

=== Executive functions ===

[[Image:frontallobes.png|thumb|350px|''Figure 9, Left frontal lobe '']]

Subsequently, the question arises how this cognitive ability of making decisions is realized in the human brain. As we already know that there are a couple of different tasks involved  in the whole process, there has to be something that coordinates and controls those brain activities – namely the '''executive functions'''. They are the brain's conductor, instructing other brain regions to perform, or be silenced, and generally coordinating their synchronized activity (Goldberg, 2001). Thus, they are responsible for optimizing the performance of all “multi-threaded” cognitive tasks.

Locating those executive functions is rather difficult, as they cannot be appointed to a single brain region. Traditionally, they have been equated with the frontal lobes, or rather the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes; but it is still an open question whether all of their aspects can be associated with these regions.

Nevertheless, we will concentrate on the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes, to get an impression of the important role of the executive functions within cognition. Moreover, it is possible to subdivide these regions into functional parts. But it is to be noted that not all researchers regard the prefrontal cortex as containing functionally different regions.


==== Executive functions in practise ====

According to Norman and Shallice, there are five types of situations in which executive functions may be needed in order to optimize performance, as the automatic activation of behaviour would be insufficient. These are situations involving...

'''  1. ...planning or decision making.'''

'''  2. ...error correction or trouble shooting.'''

'''  3. ...responses containing novel sequences of actions.'''

'''  4. ...technical difficulties or dangerous circumstances.'''

'''  5. ...the control of action or the overcoming of strong habitual responses.'''

The following parts will have a closer look to each of these points, mainly referring to brain-damaged individuals.

Surprisingly, intelligence in general is not affected in cases of frontal lobe injuries (Warrington, James &amp; Maciejewski, 1986). However, dividing intelligence into '''crystallised intelligence''' (based on previously acquired knowledge) and '''fluid intelligence''' (meant to rely on the current ability of solving problems), emphasizes the executive power of the frontal lobes, as patients with lesions in these regions performed significantly worse in tests of fluid intelligence (Duncan, Burgess &amp; Emslie, 1995).


'''1.  &lt;u&gt;Planning or decision making&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''Impairments in abstract and conceptual thinking'''

To solve many tasks it is important that one is able to use given information. In many cases, this means that material has to be processed in an abstract rather than in a concrete manner. Patients with executive dysfunction have abstraction difficulties. This is proven by a card sorting experiment (Delis et al., 1992):

The cards show names of animals and black or white triangles placed above or below the word. Again, the cards can be sorted with attention to different attributes of the animals (living on land or in water, domestic or dangerous, large or small) or the triangles (black or white, above or below word). People with frontal lobe damage fail to solve the task because they cannot even conceptualize the properties of the animals or the triangles, thus are not able to deduce a sorting-rule for the cards (in contrast, there are some individuals only perseverating; they find a sorting-criterion, but are unable to switch to a new one).

These problems might be due to a general difficulty in strategy formation.

'''Goal directed behavior'''

Let us again take Knut into account to get an insight into the field of goal directed behaviour – in principle, this is nothing but problem solving since it is about organizing behavior towards a goal. Thus, when Knut is packing his bag for his holiday, he obviously has a goal in mind (in other words: He wants to solve a problem) – namely get ready before the plane starts. There are several steps necessary during the process of reaching a certain goal:

&lt;u&gt;Goal must be kept in mind&lt;/u&gt;

Knut should never forget that he has to pack his bag in time.

&lt;u&gt;Dividing into subtasks and sequencing&lt;/u&gt;

Knut packs his bag in a structured way. He starts packing the crucial things and then goes on with rest.

&lt;u&gt;Completed portions must be kept in mind&lt;/u&gt;

If Knut already packed enough underwear into his bag, he would not need to search for more.

&lt;u&gt;Flexibility and adaptability&lt;/u&gt;

Imagine that Knut wants to pack his favourite T-Shirt, but he realizes that it is dirty. In this case, Knut has to adapt to this situation and 
has to pick another T-Shirt that was not in his plan originally.

&lt;u&gt;Evaluation of actions&lt;/u&gt;

Along the way of reaching his ultimate goal Knut constantly has to evaluate his performance in terms of ‘How am I doing considering that I have 
the goal of packing my bag?’.


'''Executive dysfunction and goal directed behavior'''

The breakdown of executive functions impairs goal directed behavior to a large extend. In which way cannot be stated in general, it depends on the specific brain regions that are damaged. So it is quite possible that an individual with a particular lesion has problems with two or three of the five points described above and performs within average regions when the other abilities are tested. However, if only one link is missing from the chain, the whole plan might get very hard or even impossible to master. Furthermore, the particular hemisphere affected plays a role as well.

Another interesting result was the fact that lesions in the frontal lobes of left and right hemisphere impaired different abilities. While a lesion in the right hemisphere caused trouble in making recency judgements, a lesion in the left hemisphere impaired the patient’s performance only when the presented material was verbal or in a variation of the experiment that required self-ordered sequencing. Because of that we know that the ability to sequence behaviour is not only located in the frontal lobe but in the left hemisphere particularly when it comes to motor action.

'''Problems in sequencing'''

In an experiment by Milner (1982), people were shown a sequence of cards with pictures. The experiment included two different tasks: recognition trials and recency trials. In the former the patients were shown two different pictures, one of them has appeared in the sequence before, and the participants had to decide which one it was. In the latter they were shown two different pictures, both of them have appeared before, they had to name the picture that was shown more recently than the other one. The results of this experiment showed that people with lesions in temporal regions have more trouble with the recognition trial and patients with frontal lesions have difficulties with the recency trial since anterior regions are important for sequencing. This is due to the fact that the recognition trial demanded a properly functioning [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory recognition memory], the recency trial a properly functioning [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory memory for item order]. These two are dissociable and seem to be processed in different areas of the brain.

The frontal lobe is not only important for sequencing but also thought to play a major role for [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory working memory]. This idea is supported by the fact that lesions in the lateral regions of the frontal lobe are much more likely to impair the ability of 'keeping things in mind' than damage to other areas of the frontal cortex do.

But this is not the only thing there is to sequencing. For reaching a goal in the best possible way it is important that a person is able to figure out which sequence of actions, which strategy, best suits the purpose, in addition to just being able to develop a correct sequence. This is proven by an experiment called 'Tower of London' (Shallice, 1982) which is similar to the famous [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis 'Tower of Hanoi'] task with the difference that this task required three balls to be put onto three poles of different length so that one pole could hold three balls, the second one two and the third one only one ball, in a way that a changeable goal position is attained out of a fixed initial position in as few moves as possible. Especially patients with damage to the left frontal lobe proved to work inefficiently and ineffectively on this task. They needed many moves and engaged in actions that did not lead toward the goal.

'''Problems with the interpretation of available information'''

Quite often, if we want to reach a goal, we get hints on how to do it best. This means we have to be able to interpret the available information in terms of what the appropriate strategy would be. For many patients of executive dysfunction this is not an easy thing to do either. They have trouble to use this information and engage in inefficient actions. Thus, it will take them much longer to solve a task than healthy people who use the extra information and develop an effective strategy.

'''Problems with self-criticism and -monitoring'''

The last problem for people with frontal lobe damage we want to present here is the last point in the above list of properties important for proper goal directed behavior. It is the ability to evaluate one's actions, an ability that is missing in most patients. These people are therefore very likely to 'wander off task' and engage in behavior that does not help them to attain their goal. In addition to that, they are also not able to determine whether their task is already completed at all. Reasons for this are thought to be a lack of motivation or lack of concern about one's performance (frontal lobe damage is usually accompanied by changes in emotional processing) but these are probably not the only explanations for these problems.

Another important brain region in this context – the medial portion of the frontal lobe – is responsible for detecting behavioral errors made while working towards a goal. This has been shown by [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Behavioural_and_Neuroscience_Methods#ERP ERP experiments] where there was an error-related negativity 100ms after an error has been made. If this area is damaged, this mechanism cannot work properly any more and the patient loses the ability to detect errors and thus monitor his own behavior.

However, in the end we must add that although executive dysfunction causes an enormous number of problems in behaving correctly towards a goal, most patients when assigned with a task are indeed anxious to solve it but are just unable to do so.


'''2.  &lt;u&gt;Error correction and trouble shooting&lt;/u&gt;'''

[[Image:wcst.jpg|thumb|350px|''Figure 10, Example for the WCST: Cards sorted according to shape (a), number (b) or color (c) of the objects'']]

The most famous experiment to investigate error correction and trouble shooting is the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). A participant is presented with cards that show certain objects. These cards are defined by shape, color and number of the objects on the cards. These cards now have to be sorted according to a rule based on one of these three criteria. The participant does not know which rule is the right one but has to reach the conclusion after positive or negative feedback of the experimenter. Then at some point, after the participant has found the correct rule to sort the cards, the experimenter changes the rule and the previous correct sorting will lead to negative feedback. The participant has to realize the change and adapt to it by sorting the cards according to the new rule.

Patients with executive dysfunction have problems identifying the rule in the first place. It takes them noticeably longer because they have trouble using already given information to make a conclusion. But once they got to sorting correctly and the rule changes, they keep sorting the cards according to the old rule although many of them notice the negative feedback. They are just not able to switch to another sorting-principle, or at least they need many tries to learn the new one. They '''perseverate'''.

'''Problems in shifting and modifying strategies'''

Intact neuronal tissue in the frontal lobe is also crucial for another executive function connected with goal directed behavior that we described above: Flexibility and adaptability. This means that persons with frontal lobe damage will have difficulties in shifting their way of thinking – meaning  creating a new plan after recognizing that the original one cannot be carried out for some reason. Thus, they are not able to modify their strategy according to this new problem. Even when it is clear that one hypothesis cannot be the right one to solve a task, patients will stick to it nevertheless and are unable to abandon it (called 'tunnel vision').
 
Moreover, such persons do not use as many appropriate hypotheses for creating a strategy as people with damage to other brain regions do. In what particular way this can be observed in patients can again not be stated in general but depends on the nature of the shift that has to be made.

These earlier described problems of 'redirecting' of one's strategies stand in contrast to the actual 'act of switching' between tasks. This is yet another problem for patients with frontal lobe damage. Since the control system that leads task switching as such is independent from the parts that actually perform these tasks, the task switching is particularly impaired in patients with lesions to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while at the same time they have no trouble with performing the single tasks alone. This of course, causes a lot of problems in goal directed behavior because as it was said before: Most tasks consist of smaller subtasks that have to be completed.


'''3.  &lt;u&gt;Responses containing novel sequences of actions&lt;/u&gt;'''

Many clinical tests have been done, requiring patients to develop strategies for dealing with novel situations. In the Cognitive Estimation Task (Shallice &amp; Evans, 1978) patients are presented with questions whose answers are unlikely to be known. People with damage to the prefrontal cortex have major difficulties to produce estimates for questions like: “How many camels are in Holland?”.

In the FAS Test (Miller, 1984) subjects have to generate sequences of words (not proper names) beginning with a certain letter (“F” , “A” or “S”) in a one-minute period. This test involves developing new strategies, selecting between alternatives and avoiding repeating previous given answers. Patients with left lateral prefrontal lesions are often impaired (Stuss et al., 1998).


'''4.  &lt;u&gt;Technical difficulties or dangerous circumstances&lt;/u&gt;'''

One single mistake in a dangerous situation may easily lead to serious injuries while a mistake in a technical difficult situation (e.g. building a house of cards) would obviously lead to failure. Thus, in such situations, automatic activation of responses clearly would be insufficient and executive functions seem to be the only solution for such problems.
 
Wilkins, Shallice and McCarthy (1987) were able to prove a connection between dangerous or difficult situations and the prefrontal cortex, as patients with lesions to this area were impaired during experiments concerning dangerous or difficult situations. The ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex may be particularly important for these aspects of executive functions.


'''5.  &lt;u&gt;Control of action or the overcoming of strong habitual responses&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''Deficits in initiation, cessation and control of action'''

We start by describing the effects of the loss of the ability to start something, to initiate an action. A person with executive dysfunction is likely to have trouble beginning to work on a task without strong help from the outside, while people with left frontal lobe damage often show impaired spontaneous speech and people with right frontal lobe damage rather show poor nonverbal fluency. Of course, one reason is the fact that this person will not have any intention, desire or concern on his or her own of solving the task since this is yet another characteristic of executive dysfunction. But it is also due to a psychological effect often connected with the loss of properly executive functioning: Psychological inertia.
Like in physics, inertia in this case means that an action is very hard to initiate, but once started, it is again very hard to shift or stop. This phenomenon is characterized by engagement in repetitive behavior, is called perseveration (cp. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Reasoning_and_Decision_Making#2.__Error_correction_and_trouble_shooting WCST]).

Another problem caused by executive dysfunction can be observed in patients suffering from the so called '''environmental dependency syndrome'''. Their actions are impelled or obligated by their physical or social environment. This manifests itself in many different ways and depends to a large extent on the individual’s personal history. Examples are patients who begin to type when they see a computer key board, who start washing the dishes upon seeing a dirty kitchen or who hang up pictures on the walls when finding hammer, nails and pictures on the floor. This makes these people appear as if they were acting impulsively or as if they have lost their ‘free will’. It shows a lack of control for their actions. This is due to the fact that an impairment in their executive functions causes a disconnection between thought and action. These patients know that their actions are inappropriate but like in the WCST, they cannot control what they are doing. Even if they are told by which attribute to sort the cards, they will still keep sorting them sticking to the old rule due to major difficulties in the translation of these directions into action.

What is needed to avoid problems like these are the abilities to start, stop or change an action but very likely also the ability to use information to direct behavior.

==== Deficits in cognitive estimation ====

Next to the difficulties to produce estimates to questions whose answers are unlikely known, patients with lesions to the frontal lobes have problems with cognitive estimation in general. 

Cognitive estimation is the ability to use known information to make reasonable judgments or deductions about the world. Now the inability for cognitive estimation is the third type of deficits often observed in individuals with executive dysfunction. It is already known that people with executive dysfunction have a relatively unaffected knowledge base. This means they cannot retain knowledge about information or at least they are unable to make inferences based on it. There are various effects which are shown on such individuals. Now for example patients with frontal lobe damage have difficulty estimating the length of the spine of an average woman. Making such realistic estimations requires inferencing based on other knowledge which is in this case, knowing that the height of the average woman is about 5ft 6 in (168cm) and considering that the spine runs about one third to one half the length of the body and so on. Patients with such a dysfunction do not only have difficulties in their estimates of cognitive information but also in their estimates of their own capacities (such as their ability to direct activity in goal – oriented manner or in controlling their emotions). Prigatuno, Altman and O’Brien (1990) reported that when patients with anterior lesions associated with diffuse axonal injury to other brain areas are asked how capable they are of performing tasks such as scheduling their daily activities or preventing their emotions from affecting daily activities, they grossly overestimate their abilities. From several experiments Smith and Miler (1988) found out that individuals with frontal lobe damages have no difficulties in determining whether an item was in a specific inspection series they find it difficult to estimate how frequently an item did occur. This may not only reflect difficulties in cognitive estimation but also in memory task that place a premium on remembering temporal information. Thus both difficulties (in cognitive estimation and in temporal sequencing) may contribute to a reduced ability to estimate frequency of occurrence.
 
Despite these impairments in some domains the abilities of estimation are preserved in patients with frontal lobe damage. Such patients also do have problems in estimating how well they can prevent their emotions for affecting their daily activities. They are also as good at judging how many dues they will need to solve a puzzle as patients with temporal lobe damage or neurologically intact people.

==== Theories of frontal lobe function in executive control ====

In order to explain that patients with frontal lobe damage have difficulties in performing executive functions, four major approaches have developed. Each of them leads to an improved understanding of the role of frontal regions in executive functions, but none of these theories covers all the deficits occurred.

'''Role of working memory'''

The most anatomically specific approach assumes the dorsolateral prefrontal area of the frontal lobe to be critical for working memory. The working memory which has to be clearly distinguished from the long term memory keeps information on-line for use in performing a task.
Not being generated for accounting for the broad array of dysfunctions it focuses on the three following deficits:

  1.)Sequencing information and directing behavior toward a goal
  2.)Understanding of temporal relations between items and events
  3.)Some aspects of environmental dependency and perseveration

Research on monkeys has been helpful to develop this approach (the delayed-response paradigm, Goldman-Rakic, 1987, serves as a classical example).

'''Role of Controlled Versus Automatic Processes'''

There are two theories based on the underlying assumption that the frontal lobes are especially important for controlling behavior in non-experienced situations and for overriding stimulus-response associations, but contribute little to automatic and effortless behavior (Banich, 1997).

Stuss and Benson (1986) consider control over behavior to occur in a hierarchical manner. They distinguish between three different levels, of which each is associated with a particular brain region. In the first level sensory information is processed automatically by posterior regions, in the next level (associated with the executive functions of the frontal lobe) conscious control is needed to direct behavior toward a goal and at the highest level controlled self-reflection takes place in the prefrontal cortex.

This model is appropriate for explaining deficits in goal-oriented behavior, in dealing with novelty, the lack of cognitive flexibility and the environmental dependency syndrome. Furthermore it can explain the inability to control action consciously and to criticise oneself.
The second model developed by Shalice (1982) proposes a system consisting of two parts that influence the choice of behavior. The first part, a cognitive system called contention scheduling, is in charge of more automatic processing. Various links and processing schemes cause a single stimulus to result in an automatic string of actions. Once an action is initiated, it remains active until inhibited. The second cognitive system is the supervisory attentional system which directs attention and guides action through decision processes and is only active “when no processing schemes are available, when the task is technically difficult, when problem solving is required and when certain response tendencies must be overcome” (Banich , 1997).

This theory supports the observations of few deficits in routine situations, but relevant problems in dealing with novel tasks (e.g. the Tower of London task, Shallice, 1982), since no schemes in contention scheduling exist for dealing with it. Impulsive action is another characteristic of patients with frontal lobe damages which can be explained by this theory. Even if asked not to do certain things, such patients stick to their routines and cannot control their automatic behavior.

'''Use of Scripts'''

The approach based on scripts, which are sets of events, actions and ideas that are linked to form a unit of knowledge was developed by Schank (1982) amongst others.

Containing information about the setting in which an event occurs, the set of events needed to achieve the goal and the end event terminating the action. Such managerial knowledge units (MKUs) are supposed to be stored in the prefrontal cortex. They are organized in a hierarchical manner being abstract at the top and getting more specific at the bottom.

Damage of the scripts leads to the inability to behave goal-directed, finding it easier to cope with usual situations (due to the difficulty of retrieving a MKU of a novel event) and deficits in the initiation and cessation of action (because of MKUs specifying the beginning and ending of an action.)

'''Role of a goal list'''

The perspective of artificial intelligence and machine learning introduced an approach which assumes that each person has a goal list, which contains the tasks requirements or goals. This list is fundamental to guiding behavior and since frontal lobe damages disrupt the ability to form a goal list, the theory helps to explain difficulties in abstract thinking, perceptual analysis, verbal output and staying on task. It can also account for the strong environmental influence on patients with frontal lobe damages, due to the lack of internal goals and the difficulty of organizing actions toward a goal.

== Summary ==

It is important to keep in mind that reasoning and decision making are closely connected to each other: Decision making in many cases happens with a previous process of reasoning. People's everyday life is decisively coined by the synchronized appearance of these two human cognitive features. This synchronization, in turn, is realized by the executive functions which seem to be mainly located in the frontal lobes of the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stationary Spatial Coordinates

Stationary spatial coordinates are based on some stationary reference, like the building you are in. We use x,y,z when talking about stationary spacial coordinates.



Material Coordinates

With material coordinates, a certain reference state is chosen at time 0 (t=0). Each point in the material is assigned a label, which is its location at t=0. We use X,Y,Z when talking about material coordinates.

For example, suppose that g(X,Y,Z,t) tells you the temperature of an object in material coordinates. g(2,3,1,5) would be the temperature of the particle labeled (2,3,1) at t=5 which means that at t=0, the paticle as at (2,3,1) in stationary spatial coordinates.



Material Derivative
Example:
The heat along a one dimensional fluid is defined as f(x,t). f is a function of stationary spacial coordinates, as indicated by the lower case letter x.

Lets consider what g(X,t) would be if it was also a description of the temperature of the same fluid but in material coordinates, as indicated by the upper case letter X.

g(X, t) = f(x, t)

For this to equation to have meaning, we needed to describe the relationship between x and X. Consider the x to be function of X and t, it is the location of the particle with label X at a particular time t.


x(X,t)

Note that x is dependent on time, t.

The material derivative of the temperature is a description of how the temperature changes at this one particular particle labeled X, (the particle moves as time passes).
We want to take the partial derivative of g(X,t) with respect to t.

Considering x is dependent on t and using the chain rule,
df/dt = df/dx dx/dt + df/dt dt/dt = df/dx dx/dt + df/dt

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you squeeze or pull on an object, you put stress on it. Imagine a rubber eraser that is being pressed or pulled. It is under stress.

The stress tensor is a way of describing the stress throughout the object precisely. The stress can vary from one point to another. For example, one side of the eraser might be pulled on (tensile stress) while the under is squeazed (compressive stress).


Normal Stress
If normal stress is applied to a cube of elastic material, (and image for example that the stress is uniform throughout), the cube with stretch in the direction of the stress. (Figure) This stress could be applied in any direction or in more than one direction simultaneously. For a 3D object, it's sufficient to describe the normal stress with three numbers. That's a nubmer that tells how it's pulled along the x direction, the y direction, and the z direction.


Shear Stress
Shear stress applied to a cube of elastic material (imagine that the stress is uniform throughout), it will shear. (Figure) You can use six numbers to represent the shear of an object. Look at how much face A moves relative to B in the x direction and the y direction. Look at how face C moves relative to D in the _ direction and the _ direction. Look at how face E moves relative to F in the _ direction and the _ direction. 
(Figure)

Because of symmetry only three numbers are needed to represent the shear stress.

== Image Problems ==
Thanks for uploading images on Wikibooks. However, the images may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user={{urlencode:{{PAGENAME}}}} all images you have uploaded] or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, ask them at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. Thank you. [[User:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:17, 7 September 2007 (UTC)
:I saw that you re-uploaded an image. The problem is that the image has no license information. Your submission says that it's your work; please decide how you want to license it, and add the corresponding license template. If you need help, feel free to ask on my talk page, or at [[WB:SLN|the staff lounge]].

If the response 1 ... c5 is the only &quot;English&quot; defense, why is 1 ... b7 typically named the English defense?--[[User:Chessnutz|Chessnutz]] 23:56, 31 July 2007 (UTC)
: Yea, that can confuse, it's two seperate lines with a similar name. 1 ...c5 is a defence to the English Opening(1. c4) and different again is 1. d4 b6 which is the &quot;English Defence&quot; in response to the Queens Pawn Opening(1.d4) http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._d4/1...b6 [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 23:19, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

== Typo ==

There's obviously a typo in the first line of the theory table. There's written &quot;5. Nf3 - Nf6&quot; But Nf6 seems absurd, it should be wether Nh6 or Ne7. I don't know anything about english opening, so I don't change it myself. [[User:Pythakos|Pythakos]] ([[User talk:Pythakos|talk]]) 14:24, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The cardiovascular exam consists of three portions:
1. Visual Examination
2. Palpation
3. Auscultation

Visual Examination:
A thorough visual examination includes examination of the jugular venous wave from as well as the chest itself.  The patient should be at about a 30 degree angle to the ground.  The examiner should look at the neck and note the pulsations of the jugular vein, which can be told apart from carotid pulsations by applying pressure distally and noting a cessation of pulsation.  The examiner should also measure the height of the jugular venous pulse from the sternum.  An abnormally high JVP may indicative of right heart failure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does anybody have a better solution for 2/4/#3 ?

----

An alternative solution for bin2dig:

  readBin :: Num a =&gt; ReadS a
  readBin = readInt 2 (\x -&gt; x=='0' || x=='1') (\x -&gt; case x of '0' -&gt; 0; '1' -&gt; 1)
  
  bin2dig x = fst $ readBin x !! 0

----

On exercise 2, people have yet to be introduced to print.

Exercise 2, section 4: &quot;Add the following lines to parseExpr; before the parser for Lists and DottedLists.&quot;  Adding the code directly there won't compile, I end up with this.

 parseExpr :: Parser LispVal
 parseExpr = parseString
             &lt;|&gt; parseNumber
             &lt;|&gt; parseAtom
             &lt;|&gt; parseQuoted
             &lt;|&gt; parseBackquoted
             &lt;|&gt; parseUnquote
             &lt;|&gt; try (do string &quot;#(&quot;
                    x &lt;- parseVector
                    char ')'
                    return x)
             &lt;|&gt; do char '('
                    x &lt;- try parseList &lt;|&gt; parseDottedList
                    char ')'
                    return x

GHC says 'parse error on input x'.  Removing the try fixes it, but I'm not sure if that has the correct semantics.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A1: For main workstation is 16 GB the optimum? ==
Hugh performance improvements can be achieved by adding more RAM memory to the system, especially when working with large sets. However, due to the addressing limits of 4GB on a 32bit system OsiriX needs to run on a 64bit system to benefit from the added memory. This requires the 64bit extension to be separately purchased. See http://www.osirix-viewer.com/OsiriX-64bit.html for more information

==A2: Is 4 core enough or is it better value to get 8 cores? ==

'''Note:''' 
This Wikibook is based on the article 
[http://tug.org/pracjourn/2007-3/henningsen/ ''Tools for Collaborative Writing of Scientific LaTeX Documents'']
by [[User:Arnehe|Arne Henningsen]]
that is published in ''The PracTeX Journal'' 2007, number 3 
(http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/).


== Abstract ==

Collaborative writing of documents requires a strong synchronisation among authors. This Wikibook describes a possible way to organise the collaborative preparation of LaTeX documents. The presented solution is primarily based on the version control system ''Subversion'' (http://subversion.apache.org/). The Wikibook describes how ''Subversion'' can be used together with several other software tools and LaTeX packages to organise the collaborative preparation of LaTeX documents.

=== Other  Methods ===

* You can use one of the online solutions listed in the [[LaTeX/Installation|Installation]] chapter. Most of them have collaboration features.

* Another option for collaboration is [http://www.getdropbox.com dropbox]. It has 2 GB free storage and versioning system. Works like SVN, but more automated and therefore especially useful for beginning LaTeX users. However, Dropbox is not a true versioning control system, and as such it does not allow you to roll the article back to previous versions.

* You can use an online collaborative tool built on top of a versioning control system, such as [https://authorea.com/ Authorea]. Authorea performs most of the actions described in this document, but in the background (it is built on Git). It allows authors to enter LaTeX or Markdown via a GUI with mathematical notation, figures, d3.js plots, IPython notebooks, data, and tables. All content is rendered to HTML5. Authorea  also features a commenting system and article-based chat to ease collaboration and review.

* As the LaTeX system uses plain text, you can use synchronous collaborative editors like [[w:Gobby|Gobby]]. In Gobby you can write your documents in collaboration with anyone in real time.  It is strongly recommended that you use utf8 encoding (especially if there are users on multiple operating systems collaborating) and a stable network (typically wired networks).  

* [http://titanpad.com TitanPad] (or other [http://etherpad.org/etherpadsites.html clones] of [[w:EtherPad|EtherPad]]). To compile use the command:&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;wget -O filename.tex &quot;http://titanpad.com/ep/pad/export/xxxx/latest?format=txt&quot; &amp;&amp; (latex filename.tex)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt; where 'xxxx' should be replaced by the pad number (something like 'z7rSrfrYcH').

* With a dedicated Linux box with LaTeX &amp; Dropbox it's possible to use Google docs and [https://gist.github.com/1995648 some scripting] to get automatically generated PDFs on Dropbox from updates on Google Docs.

* You can use a [[w:Distributed_revision_control|distributed version control system]] such as [[w:Mercurial|Mercurial]] or [[Git]]. This is the definitive solution for users looking for control and advanced features like branch and merge. The learning curve will be steeper than that for a web-based solution.

== Introduction ==

The collaborative preparation of documents
requires a considerable amount of coordination among the authors.
This coordination can be organised in many different ways,
where the best way depends on the specific circumstances.

In this Wikibook, I describe 
how the collaborative writing of LaTeX documents is organised
at our department 
(Division of Agricultural Policy, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Kiel, Germany).
I present our software tools, and describe how we use them.
Thus, this Wikibook provides some ideas and hints
that will be useful for other LaTeX users
who prepare documents together with their co-authors.


== Interchanging Documents ==

There are many ways to interchange documents among authors.
One possibility is to compose documents by interchanging e-mail messages.
This method has the advantage
that common users generally do not have to install and learn the usage of
any extra software,
because virtually all authors have an e-mail account.
Furthermore, the author who has modified the document
can easily attach the document and explain the changes by e-mail as well.
Unfortunately, there is a problem when two or more authors are working
at the same time on the same document.
So, how can authors synchronise these files?

A second possibility is to provide the document on a common file server,
which is available in most departments.
The risk of overwriting each others' modifications
can be eliminated by locking files that are currently edited.
However, generally the file server can be only accessed from within a department.
Hence, authors who are out of the building 
cannot use this method to update/commit their changes.
In this case,
they will have to use another way to overcome this problem.
So, how can authors access these files?

A third possibility is to use a version control system.
A comprehensive list of version control systems can be found at
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software Wikipedia].
Version control systems keep track of all changes in files in a project.
If many authors modify a document at the same time,
the version control system tries to merge all modifications automatically.
However, if multiple authors have modified the same line,
the modifications cannot be merged automatically,
and the user has to resolve the conflict by deciding manually
which of the changes should be kept.
Authors can also comment their modifications
so that the co-authors can easily understand the workflow of this file.
As version control systems generally communicate over the internet
(e.g. through TCP/IP connections),
they can be used from different computers with internet connections.
A restrictive firewall policy might prevent
the version control system from connecting to the internet.
In this case, the network administrator has to be asked
to open the appropriate port.
The internet is only used for synchronising the files.
Hence, a permanent internet connection is not required.
The only drawback of a version control system could be that it has to be installed and configured.

Moreover, a version control system is useful
even if a single user is working on a project.
First, the user can track (and possibly revoke) all previous modifications.
Second, this is a convenient way to have a backup of the files
on other computers (e.g. on the version control server).
Third, this allows the user to easily switch between different computers
(e.g. office, laptop, home).

== The Version Control System ''Subversion'' ==

[http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion (SVN)] comes as a successor to the popular version control system CVS. SVN operates on a client-server model in which a central server hosts a project repository that users copy and modify locally. A repository functions similarly to a library in that it permits users to check out the current project, make changes, and then check it back in. The server records all changes a user checks in (usually with a message summarizing what changes the user made) so that other users can easily apply those changes to their own local files. 

Each user has a local ''working copy'' of a remote ''repository''. For instance, users can ''update'' changes from the repository to their working copy, ''commit'' changes from their own working copy to the repository, or (re)view the differences between working copy and repository.

To set up a SVN version control system, the SVN server software has to be installed on a (single) computer with permanent internet access. (If this computer has no static IP address, one can use a service like [http://www.dyndns.com/ DynDNS] to be able to access the server with a static hostname.) It can run on many Unix, modern MS Windows, and Mac OS X platforms.

Users do not have to install the SVN server software, but a SVN &quot;client&quot; software. This is the unique way to access the repositories on the server. Besides the basic SVN command-line client, there are several Graphical User Interface Tools (GUIs) and plug-ins for accessing the SVN server (see http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html). Additionally, there are very good manuals about SVN freely available on the internet (e.g. http://svnbook.red-bean.com).

At our department, we run the SVN server on a GNU-Linux system, because most Linux distributions include it. In this sense, installing, configuring, and maintaining SVN is a very simple task.

Most MS Windows users access the SVN server by the [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] client, because it provides the most usual interface for common users. Linux users usually use SVN utilities from the command-line, or [http://zoneit.free.fr/esvn/ eSvn]--a GUI frontend--with [http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/ KDiff3] for showing complex differences.

== Hosting LaTeX files in ''Subversion'' ==

[[Image:ESvn-texmf.png|frame|right|Figure 1: 
Common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree shown in ''eSvn'''s Repository Browser]]
On our ''Subversion'' server,
we have one repository for a common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree.
Its structure complies with the
'''TeX Directory Structure''' guidelines
(TDS, http://www.tug.org/tds/tds.html,
see figure 1).
This repository provides LaTeX classes, LaTeX styles, and BibTeX styles
that are not available in the LaTeX distributions of the users,
e.g. because they were bought
or developed for the internal use at our department.
All users have a working copy of this repository
and have configured LaTeX to use this as their
personal &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree.
For instance, teTeX (http://www.tug.org/tetex/) users can edit their TeX configuration file
(e.g. &lt;tt&gt;/etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf&lt;/tt&gt;)
and set the variable &lt;tt&gt;TEXMFHOME&lt;/tt&gt;
to the path of the working copy of the common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree
(e.g. by &lt;tt&gt;TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf&lt;/tt&gt;);
MiKTeX (http://www.miktex.org/) users can add
the path of the working copy of the common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree
in the 'Roots' tab of the MiKTeX Options.

If a new class or style file has been added
(but not if these files have been modified),
the users have to update their 'file name data base' (FNDB)
before they can use these classes and styles.
For instance, teTeX users have to execute &lt;tt&gt;texhash&lt;/tt&gt;;
MiKTeX users have to click on the button 'Refresh FNDB'
in the 'General' tab of the MiKTeX Options.

Furthermore, the repository contains manuals
explaining the specific LaTeX software solution
at our department (e.g. this document).

The ''Subversion'' server hosts a separate repository
for each project of our department.
Although branching, merging, and tagging is less important
for writing text documents than for writing source code for software,
our repository layouts follow the recommendations of 
the 'Subversion book' (http://svnbook.red-bean.com).
In this sense, each repository has the three directories
&lt;tt&gt;/trunk&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/branches&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;/tags&lt;/tt&gt;.

The most important directory is &lt;tt&gt;/trunk&lt;/tt&gt;.
If a single text document belongs to the project,
all files and subdirectories of this text document are in
&lt;tt&gt;/trunk&lt;/tt&gt;.
If the project yields two or more different text documents,
&lt;tt&gt;/trunk&lt;/tt&gt; contains a subdirectory for each text document.
A slightly different version (a '''branch''') of a text document
(e.g. for presentation at a conference)
can be prepared either in an additional subdirectory of &lt;tt&gt;/trunk&lt;/tt&gt;
or in a new subdirectory of &lt;tt&gt;/branches&lt;/tt&gt;.
When a text document is submitted to a journal or a conference,
we create a '''tag''' in the directory &lt;tt&gt;/tags&lt;/tt&gt;
so that it is easy to identify the submitted version
of the document at a later date.
This feature has been proven very useful.
When creating branches and tags,
it is important always to use
the ''Subversion'' client (and not the tools of the local file system)
for these actions,
because this saves disk space on the server
and it preserves information about the same history of these documents.

Often the question arises,
which files should be put under version control.
Generally, all files that are directly modified by the user
and that are necessary for compiling the document
should be included in the version control system.
Typically, these are the LaTeX source code (&lt;tt&gt;*.tex&lt;/tt&gt;) files
(the main document and possibly some subdocuments)
and all pictures that are inserted in the document
(&lt;tt&gt;*.eps&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.jpg&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.png&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;*.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; files).
All LaTeX classes (&lt;tt&gt;*.cls&lt;/tt&gt;), LaTeX styles (&lt;tt&gt;*.sty&lt;/tt&gt;),
BibTeX data bases (&lt;tt&gt;*.bib&lt;/tt&gt;), and BibTeX styles (&lt;tt&gt;*.bst&lt;/tt&gt;)
generally should be hosted
in the repository of the common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree,
but they could be included in the respective repository,
if some (external) co-authors do not have access
to the common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree.
On the other hand,
all files that are automatically created or modified during
the compilation process (e.g.
&lt;tt&gt;*.aut&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.aux&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.bbl&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.bix&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.blg&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.dvi&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.glo&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.gls&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.idx&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.ilg&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.ind&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.ist&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.lof&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.log&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.lot&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.nav&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.nlo&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.out&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.ps&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.snm&lt;/tt&gt;,
and &lt;tt&gt;*.toc&lt;/tt&gt; files)
or by the (LaTeX or BibTeX) editor (e.g.
&lt;tt&gt;*.bak&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.bib~&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.kilepr&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.prj&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;*.sav&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.tcp&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.tmp&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*.tps&lt;/tt&gt;,
and &lt;tt&gt;*.tex~&lt;/tt&gt; files)
generally should be '''not''' under version control,
because these files are not necessary for compilation
and generally do not include additional information.
Furthermore, these files are regularly modified
so that conflicts are very likely.

== ''Subversion'' really makes the '''diff'''erence ==

A great feature of a version control system is
that all authors can easily trace the workflow of a project
by viewing the differences between arbitrary versions of the files.
Authors are primarily interested in 'effective' modifications
of the source code
that change the compiled document,
but not in 'ineffective' modifications
that have no impact on the compiled document
(e.g. the position of line breaks).
Software tools for comparing text documents ('diff tools')
generally cannot differentiate
between 'effective' and 'ineffective' modifications;
they highlight both types of modifications.
This considerably increases the effort
to find and review the 'effective' modifications.
Therefore, 'ineffective' modifications should be avoided.

In this sense, it is very important
not to change the positions of line breaks without cause.
Hence, automatic line wrapping of the users' LaTeX editors
should be turned off
and line breaks should be added manually.
Otherwise, if a single word in the beginning of a paragraph is added
or removed,
all line breaks of this paragraph might change
so that most diff tools indicate the entire paragraph as modified,
because they compare the files line by line.
The diff tools ''wdiff'' (http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/)
and ''dwdiff'' (http://os.ghalkes.nl/dwdiff.html)
are not affected by the positions of line breaks,
because they compare documents word by word.
However, their output is less clear
so that modifications are more difficult to track.
Moreover, these tools cannot be used directly with the ''Subversion''
command-line switch &lt;tt&gt;--diff-cmd&lt;/tt&gt;,
but a small wrapper script has to be used
(http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/1033).

A reasonable convention is to add a line break after each sentence
and start each new sentence in a new line.
Note that this has an advantage also beyond version control:
if you want to find a sentence in your LaTeX code
that you have seen in a compiled (DVI, PS, or PDF) file
or on a printout,
you can easily identify the first few words of this sentence
and screen for these words on the left border of your editor window.

Furthermore,
we split long sentences into several lines
so that each line has at most 80 characters,
because it is rather inconvenient to search for (small) differences
in long lines.
(Note:
For instance, the LaTeX editor ''Kile''
(http://kile.sourceforge.net/)
can assist the user in this task
when it is configured to add a vertical line
that marks the 80th column.)
We find it very useful to introduce
the additional line breaks at logical breaks of the sentence,
e.g. before a relative clause
or a new part of the sentence starts.
An example LaTeX code
that is formatted according to these guidelines
is the source code of the article 
''Tools for Collaborative Writing of Scientific LaTeX Documents''
by [[User:Arnehe|Arne Henningsen]]
that is published (including the source code) 
in ''The PracTeX Journal'' 2007, Number 3 (http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-3/henningsen/).

If the authors work on different operating systems,
their LaTeX editors will probably save the files with different newline (end-of-line) characters
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).
To avoid this type of 'ineffective' modifications,
all users can agree on a specific newline character
and configure their editor to use this newline character.
Another alternative is to add the subversion property 'svn:eol-style' and set it to 'native'.
In this case, ''Subversion'' automatically converts all newline characters of this file 
to the native newline character of the author's operating system
(http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style). 

There is also another important reason
for reducing the number of 'ineffective' modifications:
if several authors work on the same file,
the probability that the same line is modified by two or more authors
at the same time increases with the number of modified lines.
Hence, 'ineffective' modifications unnecessarily increase
the risk of conflicts (see section 
[[LaTeX/Collaborative Writing of LaTeX Documents#Interchanging Documents|Interchanging Documents]]).

[[Image:Kdiff3-modification.png|frame|right|Figure 2: Reviewing modifications in ''KDiff3'']]
Furthermore, version control systems
allow a very effective quality assurance measure:
all authors should critically review their own modifications
before they commit them to the repository
(see figure 2).
The differences between the user's working copy and the repository
can be easily inspected with a single ''Subversion'' command
or with one or two clicks in a graphical ''Subversion'' client.
Furthermore, authors should verify
that their code can be compiled flawlessly
before they commit their modifications to the repository.
Otherwise, the co-authors have to pay for these mistakes
when they want to compile the document.
However, this directive is not only reasonable for version control systems
but also for all other ways to interchange documents among authors.

''Subversion'' has a feature called 'Keyword Substitution'
that includes dynamic version information about a file
(e.g. the revision number or the last author)
into the contents of the file itself
(see e.g. http://svnbook.red-bean.com, chapter 3).
Sometimes, it is useful to include these information
not only as a comment in the LaTeX source code,
but also in the (compiled) DVI, PS, or PDF document.
This can be achieved with the LaTeX packages
''svn'' (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/svn/),
''svninfo'' (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/svninfo/),
or (preferably) ''svn-multi'' (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/svn-multi/).

The most important directives for collaborative writing of LaTeX documents
with version control systems are summarised in the following box.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; margin: 0.5em; padding:0.5em;&quot;&gt;
'''Directives for using LaTeX with version control systems'''
# Avoid 'ineffective' modifications.
# Do not change line breaks without good reason.
# Turn off automatic line wrapping of your LaTeX editor.
# Start each new sentence in a new line.
# Split long sentences into several lines so that each line has at most 80 characters.
# Put only those files under version control that are directly modified by the user.
# Verify that your code can be compiled flawlessly before committing your modifications to the repository.
# Use ''Subversion'''s diff feature to critically review your modifications before committing them to the repository.
# Add a meaningful and descriptive comment when committing your modifications to the repository.
# Use the ''Subversion'' client for copying, moving, or renaming files and folders that are under revision control.
&lt;/div&gt;

If the users are willing to let go of the built-in ''diff'' utility of SVN and use ''diff'' tools that are local on their workstations, they can put to use such tools that are more tailored to text documents. The ''diff'' tool that comes with SVN was designed with source code in mind. As such, it is built to be more useful for files of short lines. Other tools, such as '''Compare It!''' allows to conveniently compare text files where each line can span hundreds of characters (such as when each line represents a paragraph). When using a ''diff'' tool that allows convenient views of files with long lines, the users can author the TeX files without a strict line-breaking policy.

=== Visualizing ''diffs'' in LaTeX: latexdiff and changebar ===

The tools [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/ latexdiff] and [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/changebar/ changebar] can visualize differences of two LaTeX files inside a generated document. This makes it easier to see impact of certain changes or discuss changes with people not custom to LaTeX. Changebar comes with a script &lt;code&gt;chbar.sh&lt;/code&gt; which inserts a bar in the margin indicating parts that have changed. Latexdiff allows different styles of visualization. The default is that discarded text is marked as red and added text is marked as blue. It also supports a mode similar to Changebar which adds a bar in the margin. Latexdiff comes with a script &lt;code&gt;latexrevise&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to accept or decline changes. It also has a wrapper script to support version control systems such as the discussed Subversion.

An example on how to use Latexdiff in the Terminal.

    latexdiff old.tex new.tex &gt; diff.tex               # Files old.tex and new.tex are compared and the file visualizing the changes is written to diff.tex
    pdflatex diff.tex                                  # Create a PDF showing the changes

The program [http://www.qtrac.eu/diffpdf.html DiffPDF] can be used to compare two existing PDFs visually. There is also a command line tool [http://www.qtrac.eu/comparepdf.html comparepdf] based on DiffPDF.

== Managing collaborative bibliographies ==

Writing of scientific articles, reports, and books requires
the citation of all relevant sources.
BibTeX is an excellent tool for citing references and creating bibliographies
(Markey 2005, Fenn 2006).
Many different BibTeX styles can be found
on CTAN (http://www.ctan.org)
and on the LaTeX Bibliography Styles Database
(http://jo.irisson.free.fr/bstdatabase/).
If no suitable BibTeX style can be found,
most desired styles can be conveniently assembled with
''custombib''/''makebst'' 
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/custom-bib/).
Furthermore, BibTeX style files can be created or modified manually;
however this action requires knowledge of the (unnamed) postfix stack language
that is used in BibTeX style files
(Patashnik 1988).

At our department, we have a common bibliographic data base
in the BibTeX format (.bib file).
It resides in our common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree
(see section 'Hosting LaTeX files in ''Subversion''')
in the subdirectory &lt;tt&gt;/bibtex/bib/&lt;/tt&gt;
(see figure 1).
Hence, all users can specify this bibliography by only using the file name 
(without the full path) ---
no matter where the user's working copy of the common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree
is located.

All users edit our bibliographic data base
with the graphical BibTeX editor ''JabRef''
(http://jabref.sourceforge.net/).
As ''JabRef'' is written in ''Java'',
it runs on all major operating systems.
As different versions of ''JabRef'' generally
save files in a slightly different way
(e.g. by introducing line breaks at different positions),
all users should use the same (e.g. last stable) version of ''JabRef''.
Otherwise, there would be many differences
between different versions of &lt;tt&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; files
that solely originate from using different version of ''JabRef''.
Hence, it would be hard to find the real differences
between the compared documents.
Furthermore, the probability of conflicts would be much higher
(see section 'Subversion really makes the difference').
As ''JabRef'' saves the BibTeX data base with the native newline character 
of the author's operating system,
it is recommended to add the ''Subversion'' property 'svn:eol-style' and set it to 'native'
(see section 'Subversion really makes the difference').

[[Image:JabRef-KeyPattern.png|frame|right|Figure 3:
Specify default key pattern in ''JabRef'']]
''JabRef'' is highly flexible
and can be configured in many details.
We make the following changes to the default configuration
of ''JabRef'' to simplify our work.
First, we specify the default pattern for BibTeX keys
so that ''JabRef'' can automatically generate keys
in our desired format.
This can be done by selecting
&lt;tt&gt;Options&lt;/tt&gt;
&amp;rarr; &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
&amp;rarr; &lt;tt&gt;Key pattern&lt;/tt&gt;
and modifying the desired pattern in the field
&lt;tt&gt;Default pattern&lt;/tt&gt;.
For instance, we use &lt;tt&gt;[auth:lower][shortyear]&lt;/tt&gt;
to get the last name of the first author in lower case
and the last two digits of the year of the publication
(see figure 3).

[[Image:JabRef-GeneralFields.png|frame|right|Figure 4:
Set up general fields in ''JabRef'']]
Second, we add the BibTeX field &lt;tt&gt;location&lt;/tt&gt; for information
about the location,
where the publication is available as hard copy
(e.g. a book or a copy of an article).
This field can contain the name of the user who has the hard copy
and where he has it or the name of a library and the shelf-mark.
This field can be added in ''JabRef'' by selecting
&lt;tt&gt;Options&lt;/tt&gt;
&amp;rarr; &lt;tt&gt;Set up general fields&lt;/tt&gt;
and adding the word &lt;tt&gt;location&lt;/tt&gt;
(using the semicolon (&lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;) as delimiter)
somewhere in the line that starts with &lt;tt&gt;General:&lt;/tt&gt;
(see figure 4).

[[Image:JabRef-ExternalPrograms.png|frame|right|Figure 5:
Specify 'Main PDF directory' in ''JabRef'']]
Third, we put all PDF files of publications in a specific
subdirectory in our file server,
where we use the BibTeX key as file name.
We inform ''JabRef'' about this subdirectory
by selecting
&lt;tt&gt;Options&lt;/tt&gt;
&amp;rarr; &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
&amp;rarr; &lt;tt&gt;External programs&lt;/tt&gt;
and adding the path of the this subdirectory
in the field &lt;tt&gt;Main PDF directory&lt;/tt&gt;
(see figure 5).
If a PDF file of a publication is available,
the user can push the &lt;tt&gt;Auto&lt;/tt&gt; button
left of ''JabRef'''s &lt;tt&gt;Pdf&lt;/tt&gt; field
to automatically add the file name of the PDF file.
Now, all users who have access to the file server
can open the PDF file of a publication
by simply clicking on ''JabRef'''s PDF icon.

If we send the LaTeX source code of a project
to a journal, publisher, or somebody else
who has no access to our common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree,
we do not include our entire bibliographic data base,
but extract the relevant entries with
the Perl script ''aux2bib'' (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/utils/bibtools/aux2bib).

==Conclusion==

This wikibook describes a possible way
to efficiently organise the collaborative preparation
of LaTeX documents.
The presented solution is based on the
''Subversion'' version control system
and several other software tools and LaTeX packages.
However, there are still a few issues
that can be improved.

First, we plan that all users install
the same LaTeX distribution.
As the ''TeX Live'' distribution (http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
is available both for Unix and MS Windows operating systems,
we might recommend our users to switch to this LaTeX distribution
in the future.
(Currently, our users have different LaTeX distributions
that provide a different selection of LaTeX packages
and different versions of some packages.
We solve this problem by providing some packages on
our common &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree.)

Second, we consider to simplify
the solution for a common bibliographic data base.
Currently it is based on the
version control system ''Subversion'',
the graphical BibTeX editor ''JabRef'',
and a file server for the PDF files of publications in the data base.
The usage of three different tools for one task
is rather challenging for infrequent users
and users that are not familiar with these tools.
Furthermore, the file server can be only accessed by local users.
Therefore, we consider to implement an integrated server solution
like ''WIKINDX'' (http://wikindx.sourceforge.net/),
''Aigaion'' (http://www.aigaion.nl/),
or ''refBASE'' (http://refbase.sourceforge.net/).
Using this solution only requires a computer with internet access
and a web browser,
which makes the usage of our data base considerably easier
for infrequent users.
Moreover, the stored PDF files are available
not only from within the department,
but throughout the world.
(Depending on the copy rights of the stored PDF files,
the access to the server
--- or least the access to the PDF files ---
has to be restricted to members of the department.)
Even Non-LaTeX users of our department might benefit
from a server-based solution,
because it should be easier to use this bibliographic data base
in (other) word processing software packages,
because these servers provide the data not only in BibTeX format,
but also in other formats.

All readers are encouraged to contribute to this wikibook
by adding further hints or ideas
or by providing further solutions to the problem
of collaborative writing of LaTeX documents.

Welcome, Arnehe!  You might be interested in our [[Understanding darcs|darcs]] wikibook (disclosure: I'm one of its principle authors, and part of darcs devel community).  I think darcs is particularly relevant to LaTeX, because scientific papers tend to be small enough to make the pain threshold of setting up an SVN repository 'not worth it', whereas with a distributed system, you just 'init' and go.

== Collaborative Writing of LaTeX Documents ==

My Wikibook ''[[LaTeX/Collaborative_Writing_of_LaTeX_Documents|Collaborative Writing of LaTeX Documents]]'' is rather general. 
It uses the version control system ''Subversion'' as an example, 
but the hints and ideas presented in this Wikibook are not specific to ''Subversion''.
Hence, this Wikibook should be useful for users of any version control system (including ''darcs'').
Users of other version control systems are invited to add hints that are specific to their version control system.</text>

If you have any questions about the Muggle's Guide in particular (specifically how we write things here and our set of standards), please leave me a message at my talk page. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:46, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36]] ==

Could you please tell me if the Greater Picture section is your work? I suspect it was copied from somewhere and I removed it but would like to reinstate the content if it is truly yours. Please reply on my talk page. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:51, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

== Welcome (Again) ==

Hello again. I've reinstated your edits on the above-linked page (sounded convincing enough to me). For future reference, we use &quot;user talk&quot; pages here to communicate with each other directly although what you wrote on the talk page for the chapter isn't that bad either. Going to [[User talk:Withinfocus]] is how you can talk to me. We all have these pages and get notifications when someone writes on them.

Now, onto the Muggles' Guide. First, one thing to be careful about when using a text editor like Microsoft Word is that it won't always copy into plain-text well. Please check over that Greater Picture section you added for spelling, grammar, and special character issues. One of the most common errors in conversion is ellipses (the &quot;...&quot;) which I noticed in your text. Also, please check out our [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter#Project standards|project standards]]. Those will teach you a lot about how we edit stuff here. We have three very experienced editors here as well, [[User talk:Chazz]], [[User talk:PNW Raven]], and [[User talk:Jokes Free4Me]] (these are their user talk pages). Please try to get in touch with them as you learn about our book. Browse around the wiki for a while, practice at the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]], and get an overall feel for how editing the wiki works and you should be all set! -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:11, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

== Suggestion about that writeup ==

I've made a small proposal at the bottom of [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|the project talk page]]. As it involves your write-up, I think you might want to comment? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:51, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

== Your Signature ==

Hah, you copied my signature style I see. Please change your colors at least! My eyes get caught on your signature when I'm looking for my own! Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:22, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

:No problem whatsoever; it was a very trivial comment. I can already see that you're picking up the wiki language and by now I figure you're fully competent to edit the Muggles' Guide and its respective sections without any problems. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:02, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

-[[User:lmskiver|&lt;font color=&quot;67008C&quot;&gt;'''lmskiver'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#e02b00&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&amp;dagger;'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''[[User talk:Lmskiver|alk]]'''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 05:25, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

== Muggle's Guide analysis ==

I just thought I should let you know that I have split up your writing into two pieces and placed in the sections that withinfocus had suggested, more or less.

You said: &quot;''I could write a whole section on how JKR, accused of Wicca and occult promotion, has woven a tale that can be viewed positively from a Christian point of view...''&quot; Would you? Please? I think I very much see that as being something that belongs in the discussion of the entire series.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Wikipedia:Java (programming language) | Java]] is an [[Wikipedia:object oriented | object oriented]] programming language first released by [[Wikipedia:Sun Microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] in 1995.  It blended concepts from existing languages such as [[Wikipedia:C++ | C++]] and [[Wikipedia:Smalltalk | Smalltalk]] into a new programming language.  It achieved its success over the many rival languages of the day because it was associated with this newish thing called the &quot;Internet&quot; in allowing Java applets to be embedded in web pages and run using Netscape.  Its other main reason for success was unlike many of its competitors it was open, &quot;free&quot;, and not embedded with a integrated development environment (IDE).  Java also included the source code to its class library.  This enabled Java to be adopted by many different companies producing their own Java development environments but sharing the same language, this open model fostered the growth in the Java language and continues today with the open sourcing of Java.

Java quickly moved from allowing developers to build dinky applets to being the standard server-side language running much of the Internet today.  The Enterprise Edition (JEE) of Java was defined to provide an open model for server application to be written and portable across any compliant JEE platform provider.  The JEE standard is basically a basket of other Java specifications brought together under one umbrella and has major providers including IBM WebSphere, RedHat JBoss, Sun Glassfish, BEA WebLogic, Oracle AS and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Salam! Birinci dərsinizə xoş gəlmişsiniz!''' If you're wondering what that meant, it means '''Hello! Welcome to your first lesson!'''. Read on to learn more interjections.

==Greetings==
Hello! - '''Salam ələyküm!''', or '''Salam!''' for short!

''Note that if someone says the former greeting, you must say the following back:''

Hello! - '''Ələyküm salam'''

How are you? - '''Necəsiniz (formal)''', ''Necəsən (informal)''

I'm fine, thanks. - '''Yaxşıyam, sağ olun.'''

''And this is invariably followed by:''

And you? - '''Bəs siz?'''

''To which you can reply:''

Thank you (very much). - '''Çox sağ olun.'''

''After making a new Azeri friend, it would be rude &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; to say the following (and there are two ways of saying it):''

Nice to meet you. - '''Məmnun oldum.''' / '''Çox şadam.'''

===Greetings at different times of the day===
Good morning! - '''Sabahınız xeyir! (formal)''', ''Sabahın xeyir! (informal)''

Good afternoon! - '''Gün aydın!'''

Good evening! - '''Axşamınız xeyir! (formal)''', ''Axşamın xeyir! (informal)''

Good night! - '''Gecəniz xeyir! (formal)''', ''Gecən xeyir! (informal)''

==Goodbyes==
Goodbye! - '''Sağ olun!'''

See you! - '''Görüşədək!'''

See you (on Monday)! - '''(Bazar ərtəsi günü) görüşədək!'''

==When put into context...==
'''Aysel''': Salam ələyküm! Mənim adım Ayseldir.

'''Tural''': Ələyküm salam, Aysel! Mən Tural.

'''Aysel''': Necəsiniz, Tural?

'''Tural''': Yaxşıyam. Və siz?

'''Aysel''': Çox yaxşıyam, sağ olun.

'''Tural''': Yaxşı. Tanış olduğumuza məmnun oldum.

'''Aysel''': Mənde məmnun oldum.

'''Tural''': Sağ olun!

'''Aysel''': Görüşədək!

===Translation===
'''Aysel''': Hello! My name is Aysel!

'''Tural''': Hello, Aysel! I'm Tural.

'''Aysel''': How are you?

'''Tural''': I'm good. And you?

'''Aysel''': I'm very good, thank you.

'''Tural''': Good. Nice to meet you.

'''Aysel''': Nice to meet you too.

'''Tural''': Goodbye

'''Aysel''': See you!

==Notes==
In Azerbaijani, as is true with many other languages, when you're talking to someone you've never met before/rarely ever talk to/worthy of respect, you refer to them in the plural form. As you can see in the conversation, rather than referring to each other as ''sən'' (you [singular]), they refer to each other as ''siz'' (you [plural]). This is only a formality, but very important.

Another thing to note is that they rarely use the word ''mən'' (I) when referring to themselves. In Turkish, as long as the reader/listener can understand who the writer/speaker is talking about, words such as ''mən'', ''sən'', ''o'' (he/she), etc., don't need to be used.

Also, when Tural says &quot;Mən Tural&quot; (meaning &quot;I'm Tural, but literally &quot;Me Tural&quot;), it's just like in Tarzan, when Tarzan goes &quot;Me Tarzan, you Jane&quot;. In Azerbaijani, this is considered to be normal, because the copula (&quot;to be&quot; in English) is considered redundant.

==Homework==

      <text xml:space="preserve">To WithinFocus... 

First, I introduced myself as a new user as you indicated, but I'm not sure how to do the commenting back and forth thing... but I'm trying to reach you in order to let you know that the info I posted for the Greater Picture on HP book 7 is totally, 100% authentic... 

Next, I say thank-you, I'll take it as a compliment that you suspected plaigiarism. Truth is I happen to be a pretty good writer... if you could ask my friends who always come to me for their master's theses, school work, and even their job reports, you'd understand. In lieu, you'll just have to take my word for it and maybe check the &quot;User info thingy&quot; &lt; can't remember what it's called and I was just there 5 min. ago &gt; and you'll be able to recognize the writing style. 

Anyway, I wrote it last night as a word doc and copy/pasted into the Muggles Guide book... so if you need to see the original doc properties to verify, it can be included as an email attachment if you wish to share how to get in touch.

From: lmskiver@hotmail.com

== Too many friends killed off ==

I think J.K. could have done a little less killing off close friends of Harry Potter.If she had also killed of Hermione and Ron i think he would not have given a shit about dying or Voldemort.I think she should have left either Tonks or Remus alive and Dobby's death was pretty useless also cause in the end the goblin still fooled them.Besides all the fuss about a sword that still shows up when its needed.

:But then his death would have been of no use... it was because he was dying to protect his friends that Voldemort was unable to harm Neville. And yes, the sword shows up when needed... if one has the Sorting Hat, that being where it seems to come from, though nobody yet knows that it has that habit. As to all the deaths: that is part of what makes it a good story: consistency. Death Eaters kill people, if there were too many spared, it would feel false. Myself, if either Remus or Tonks was to die without the other, I think it would just be too sad for words; they are so very much in love with each other. And again, consistency: whichever one died first would spur the other into a bout of berserk rage, and he or she would be extremely likely to get killed as well... though not alone. I have to admit to feeling a little short-changed at not seeing their final battles... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:12, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

== That bit in the greater picture section ==

I removed it cause first of all we don't know if there will be future books and secondly cause it was all pure speculation (little of which was logical, I might add).

:We discussed this in some detail, Raven and I, and came to the conclusion that, while it was extremely speculative, there was not justification for removing it. Herewith, I replicate the discussion from Raven's Talk page. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:02, 23 March 2012 (UTC)

== The Twins and time travel ==

You recently restored some text indicating a possibility that the Twins could perhaps travel in time. I think I have to react with extreme skepticism... because if they could, why would they have bet with Bagman? Within 24 hours after they had won, their money would have disappeared; surely they could have gone back in time to warn themselves. Additionally, there is the fact that Hermione never did go forward in time, only backward; it seems that there is a limitation there, and it seems to me a natural one, that you cannot go forward, because the future has not yet occurred and so you don't have a target to aim at.

However. More to the point: The twins made some very bad decisions, decisions that could have been avoided if they had time travel, and the fact that they made those decisions indicates that they didn't know what was going to happen. I tend to believe that the accuracy of the Twins' wager was more due to attentive following of the sport and the players, and a view of the players' capabilities unbiased by team or national loyalty. It is only just possible that they had found some technique for clairvoyance, and the reason they did not see Bagman's defection or Fred's death was because they were not looking for it. But it is pretty much impossible, in my opinion, that we will ever see Fred again.

If you want to leave that text standing, or modify it to include my thoughts, be my guest... I will even go through and add the links later. But my immediate thought is that it does not belong because it is just too far out in left field to even qualify as speculation. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:01, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

:I certainly did not appreciate having someone anonymously deleting my text as &quot;nonsense&quot; and without discussing it with me. The Twins time traveling is hardly &quot;out in left field&quot; as we have seen characters do just that. I came across several online comments by readers several years ago on the possibility that the Twins could have used this method to determine the Match's outcome. It seemed plausible to me (more likely than having found a clairvoyance technique), and led to my speculation that George would consider using it again to save Fred. He would, in fact, do anything to save his brother. I also read speculation on the Harry Potter WIKI that both Bill Weasley and Percy Weasley could have used a Time Turner to achieve so many OWLs while studying at Hogwarts. If that is true,then maybe the Twins &quot;borrowed&quot; it from Percy at some point while he was still at Hogwarts and were unable to access it later to go back and change their resulting losses. Regardless, it is reasonable they could have time traveled, and it could be endlessly speculated about other ways they obtained the results to no point and with less proof. 

:Also, saying that it is not possible to go forward in time based on Hermione only being seen going back is without merit. Hermione would have been under strict restrictions on how she was to use the Time Turner and may have only been allowed to use it one way, or she simply chose not to go forward in time, only back (being as she is a creature of habit). We simply don't know. I wrote the section as an intersting speculation based on what we've seen the characters are capable of doing in the series, and on how Rowling plants clues long before they are explained. George's missing ear also seemed a little too obvious to me as a means to tell the two apart. Just how all this would happen, if it was included in a future book, is up to the author, I'm just saying it is possible, and of all the characters who were killed or presumed killed, then Fred and Mad Eye Moody seem the only ones who could possibly reappear.

::Well, I don't agree, to me it feels counter to anything else we've seen in the series... but I don't see this as worth a battle by any means. And I will point out that we did see Fred dead, therefore it is extremely unlikely that it would be possible to bring him back&amp;mdash;it would cause a paradox. If you want, I'll go in and linkify it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:53, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

Hello All,

This is my first go at this... and I was compelled to become invovled after completing the last book in the Harry Potter series, where I would like to contribute more to the analyses and understanding of the big picture of series. This is due in part to my periodic obsession with the books (coinciding with their release dates, hmmm?), but most recently to the fantastic finale' of the series. No spoiling here... just profound admiration for an author that managed to take all of the themes and significant details of all of the books and weave such a beautiful tapestry.

On a more personal note, as a Christian, I also find the series fascinating... but not from the traditional critical and dismissive view. Rather, I recognize motifs that are opportunities to begin discussion of these beliefs in conjunction with the HP series. While obviously opposed to occult practices in real life, I liken Rowlings works to the famed Inklings that included J.R.R.Tolkein and C.S. Lewis, each of whom dealt with Christian themes in their works.

I acknowledge that it was probably not Rowling's direct attempt to write a series with any particular religion in view (No! Not even Wicca!). Still, I commend the author for recognizing that our core beleifs and outward behavior are significant in defining ourselves, and matter to others and the world around us.

Viewpoints aside... I am a both a High School Engineering &amp; Science Instructor (Teacher sounds so banal) and a Graduate student at Michigan Technological University in the M.S. Applied Science Ed. program. My current subjects taught are Physics &amp; Engineering.

So one might wonder where reading/writing comes in? The answer is a seed planted in my own education. In 12th grade, I had an Advanced Placement English Instructor who also taught at our local university. She ignited my love of reading and writing. Thus,as an Undergrad at Eastern Mich. Univ., I naturally incorporated an English Language &amp; Literature minor with my science major, rather than the traditional math.

I've never had the opportunity to teach English since there is a shortage of teachers in my major areas. So, I must satisfy my enjoyment and desires for reading/writing as a hobby, which I am able to do via postings, discussion, and the occassional correction of information (this usually limited to commenting or changing pages that include &quot;bad science&quot;), which is to say writings that perpetuate myths, misunderstandings, or misinformation about science/engineering content.

While writing this, it just occured to me that it might also be fun to analyze the Science of Harry Potter. Perhaps in Mythbusters fashion... the floo network &amp; port key travel... Busted? Confirmed? or Plausible?

      <text xml:space="preserve">A wikibook is collaborative writing on a website, anyone can contribute and edit the pages live online. We are trying to establish a knowledge base and a means for ongoing development that is available anytime, anywhere.


'''What is the need we are trying to meet? '''(''Problem to solve'')
Our problem is too many meetings, having to be in the same place at the same time to work on a project or convey information.  The Wiki allows us to brainstorm, compile, and come to conclusions collectively without having to be in the same room.


'''Is the effort worth the return? '''(''Optimize short/long term effort'')
It may be a little new, another &quot;place to go&quot; but in the long run it can be a great collaborative knowledge base where everyone has a say!


'''Does it contribute to our main point of effort '''(''Point = EXPERIENCE'')
The point is to give everyone a level playing field to address issues and concerns.  We can learn from each others experience!!!


==What do you think?==
This is another good aid for collaboration from the satellite offices. Used in conjunction with other electronic meeting systems it could be part of the answer .(Tom)

I think it's a good way to get our ideas out there, and it helps to see other input in writing.  It's also a good way to keep us on track and we can't interrupt each other. (Bev)

I think that it might be a good way to also capture some of that organizational knowledge.  The why's and hows of what we do that get lost in the shuffle.  It seems like it might also be a great way to meet and work without having to meet face to face.  I like it (Alice)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have created a section for a description of the lattice method.  I hope someone gets around to it before I do. It needs to be explained with graphics.  As you can see, The standard algorithm needs to be further explained as well.  It is important that the lattice method be included because it is used by many educators, and is a valid algorithm that finds its value in the service of differentiated environments.  Though I have included a critisism of its &quot;standardized&quot; use, I see value in it as a way for students make the neccessary connections that will support their comfort with the standard algorithm.  Multiplication with Decimals also needs to be addressed and I have made a heading for that.  -Leightwing

Fabonacci demonstrated the jalousie method (a.k.a. lattice method) as a more refined version of the grid.  For example:

The grid

     | 200 | 70 | 5 |
 =======================
 50 ||     |    |   ||
 ----------------------
  2 ||     |    |   ||
 ======================

Becomes the lattice

      | 2 | 7 | 5 |
   ================
     /| / | / | / | 5
    / |/  |/  |/  |
   /  |---+---+---| 
  /  /|  /| / | / | 2
 /  / | / |/  |/  |
 ===================

Multiply each pair, placing the digit in the tens value above the slash and the ones value below:
  
      | 2 | 7 | 5 |
   ================
     /|1/ |3/ |2/ | 5
    / |/0 |/5 |/ 5|
   /  |---+---+---| 
  /  /|0 /|1/ |1/ | 2
 /  / | /4|/4 |/0 |
 ===================

Add the diagonals (each diagonal includes the numbers with a common place -- e.g. ones, tens, hundreds...) from left to right, carrying any tens to the next summation:

      | 2 | 7 | 5 |
   ================
     /|1/ |3/ |2/ | 5
    / |/0 |/5 |/ 5|
   /  |---+---+---| 
  /  /|0 /|1/ |1/ | 2
 /  / | /4|/4 |/0 |
 ===================
     1   1
  1  4   3  0  0

I think this improves on the grid method shown.  In my opinion it demonstrates place values better and represents a simpler and more practical approach to solving the problem. Perhaps others find this method more confusing.  If not the method, maybe others have a better gift for describing the method.  I'll leave it to others to edit the module as they see fit.</text>

We have purposely left the categories broad, so subcategories can emerge out of need.  When possible, we will integrate other communication tools such as the Cyber Center and Front Desk Protocol that have also been established so we all have access to learn and provide input.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Front Desk Notice==
We DO NOT hand out the Williamsburg key. Webb Media downstairs (x6228, webmedia@odu.edu) handles events other than those sponsored by the CMC. Others can use laptop projection only. This ensures our equipment is there and operable when we need it.

DO NOT take personal calls on your cell phone at the front desk.  If it is an emergency or you need to take it, get coverage and take your call elsewhere.

DO use professionalism in your appearance, language, and demeanor.

NO studying at the front desk.

==Front Desk Manual==

&lt;u&gt;WHEN TRANSFERRING A CALL&lt;/u&gt;, please find out FIRST: '''WHO''' is calling and '''WHY''' they are calling.  Let the person you transfer the call to know that information.  Do some digging!  Sometimes, you'll find out all a person wants is an appointment made!


There are two sections on the &lt;u&gt;Job Fairs page: FOR STUDENTS AND ALUM and FOR EMPLOYERS&lt;/u&gt;.  Make sure if an employer or school is looking to sign up for a Job Fair, you direct them to the proper section.  (A good way to explain it to them is: &quot;Look at the section under the INSTANT CAREER MESSAGING icon on the Job Fairs page&quot;)


&lt;u&gt;MAKING APPOINTMENTS:&lt;/u&gt;

Make sure it does NOT conflict with other appointments or meetings around it!  

''For example'', if &quot;Joe&quot; has a 9AM meeting in the Webb Center that lasts 1 hour, do not schedule an appointment at 10AM in BAL for &quot;Joe&quot; to meet a student.  Think - most meetings last longer than one hour exactly and it takes time for &quot;Joe&quot; to walk from Webb Center to BAL.

Do include this information when making appointments (unless otherwise directed by the staff member him/herself):  '''NAME, YEAR, IF SENIOR (PUT GRAD DATE), IF ALUMNI (PUT YEAR), MAJOR, ODU/CONTACT EMAIL ADDRESS, CONTACT PHONE NUMBER, REASON FOR THE APPT, AND YOUR INITIALS.'''  It is important to put your initials, so the person who you made the appointment for can call you for details if they are unsure about the reason the appt was made.

&lt;u&gt;STUDENT OR ALUMNI NEEDS RESUME REVIEW:&lt;/u&gt; 
Find out if there is a specific reason why need their resume reviewed and refer to the appropriate person:
They can '''walk-in''' the Career Cyber Center.
They can '''make an appointment''' with their Liaison or Internship/Co-op Coordinator.
They can '''email''' their resume to the Cyber Coach, Liaison, or Internship/Co-op Coordinator.

''For example'', if &quot;Mary&quot; walks in and wants to make an appointment to get her resume reviewed by her Liaison, find out why she is getting her resume reviewed!  
If she is wanting to use it to get an internship, maybe it's best if she meets her Intership/Co-op Coordinator for a review and to get internship ready.  
If she is graduating in a year and is thinking about careers, it's best for her to see her Liaison.  
If she wants to attend the Job Fair next week, she should see a Cyber Coach for a quicker response.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Heritage and Home?  Ridiculous.  (And insultingly obvious.)

In order to make a plausible character, don't think that you're making a character, think that you're making a human.  A real person.  Look at yourself.  What in your past had most impact on how you've turned out to date?

Heritage is certainly not as important as the author of this wikibook makes it out to be.  I am Swiss and American (a dual citizen).  What difference does that make?  Those two words are so general and vague that they hardly matter.  It matters a bit more that I grew up in a boring little suburb of a city in Wisconsin, not small enough so that you know everyone, but not large enough to have interesting history or unique little shops; the majority of people in town are annoyingly conservative; when I was 9 my family and I moved back to Switzerland, but only for a year, and I now yearn to live abroad.  From just that bit of information you can probably guess a lot about my personality and views about the world.  The fact that I am &quot;Swiss&quot; tells you nothing.  

And &quot;accent&quot;.  Agh!  Saying that a person has an &quot;Irish&quot; accent is silly.  I've little doubt that someone who has grown up in Ireland could pin-point the accent of a fellow Irishman down to a city, or at the very least, a county.  Make your freckled, ginger-haired lad, if you must, but at least tell us he speaks (and probably swears) like a dock-hand from Belfast (supposing those exist...).  If his British accent matters enough for you to tell us about it, it should matter enough to be plausible and precise. 

Also, speaking of home, what about the people that brought you up?  They are perhaps the most influential part of anyone's background.  Who were they?  How did they treat you?  Were they divorced?  What did they do for a living?  Were you brought up by a crazy uncle on your mum's side that was obsessed with medieval history, his violin, and prostitutes, and didn't care much about children?  The point of &quot;background&quot;, as far as I know, is that it makes you who you are.  One might turn out differently if one had walked in on their uncle with one of those prostitutes...

Siblings.  Were you the passionate enemy of all 3 of your younger brothers, or bosom friends with your older sister?  Did you fight with your brothers and sisters as a kid, but develop respectful alliances as an adult?  Were you an only child?

What were your friends like?  Did you even have any, or were your books/computers/stuffed animals your only friends?  Did that cause you to develop a vivid imagination?

What was your situation at school?  Were you an over-achiever, the valedictorian, concertmaster, winner of prestigious awards and scholarships?  Was it your dream to go into academia?  Were you bullied? Were you (to the annoyance of your parents, who were both university professors) hellishly average at everything?  Were you a downright failure?  Did you briefly get away with doing drugs?

And, if your character has to be distinctly from one country, what happened to the rest of the world?  Too many characters are of European descent.  How about a Chinese-American who grew up in NYC to an impoverished and demanding, but supportive family?  (Ah, but even there we're still located in the U.S.!)  Be original, damn it!  Have a character from the Cote d'Ivoire, even if it necessitates some research on that country.

Not all of a character's background is relevant in a story, but all of it shaped him/her.  Be realistic but creative.
(Why did I bother writing all of that?  Unless someone is as thick as the author of this &quot;book&quot;, they shouldn't need any more than their own creativity and common sense to think up a character.)

::Thanks for signing your post.
Here's the deal, it was about three years ago when I made this wikibook, back then, I knew nothing about character creation and wanted to. You guys didn't have a book on the subject, so I made one. It's not the best, but it can become the best through numerous edits by myself and others. In fact, the purpose of wikibooks is to provide valuable information where there wasn't any before, so, instead of deleting this book, why don't you just try and edit it?

== Overview ==

For the definition of a Horcrux, see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]].

The entire Harry Potter series revolves around the defeat of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]], which cannot be complete until all the Horcruxes are destroyed. This article lists the Horcruxes and details about them as best they are known.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The entire Horcrux plot starts some forty years before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is born, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] about Horcruxes, whether if having one's soul in two places would allow return from death, would not multiple Horcruxes provide additional security? Would, perhaps, seven be a better number, as seven has so many mystical properties? Professor Slughorn is revolted at the idea, but Riddle does come away with the idea that it is not impossible. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] professor, may have suspected that Riddle was studying Horcruxes; it is likely that he had already removed the books about Horcruxes from the library, as Riddle apparently claimed he could not find them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] was able to retrieve these books from Dumbledore's study with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|summoning charm]].

Although there does not seem to be any mention of this fact in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], where Horcruxes were first introduced by name, it is mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that Dumbledore thought Riddle had already made one Horcrux before his talk with Professor Slughorn. In fact, this is the case: according to the author, it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle Sr.'s]] death that allowed creation of the Ring Horcrux, and it was on the night that Riddle killed his father that he first found, and stole, the ring; and in Slughorn's memory we see Tom wearing the ring. So the inescapable conclusion is that the ring was a Horcrux at that point, though almost certainly the only one.

Riddle generally chose to make Horcruxes out of items that had value to him, and chose to hide them in places that were significant to him as well. It is possible that as he created more Horcruxes, the soul shards that he was able to split off and set aside would each be weaker than the previous. Thus, one would expect that the first Horcrux he made would be stronger than the second, which would be stronger than the third, and so forth. This does not seem to be the case; while the remnant of soul that remained within Riddle apparently became very frayed and fragile, each of the Horcruxes was as strongly able to defend itself as the earlier ones.

In the end, Riddle (or Voldemort, as he is later known) does end up making seven Horcruxes, one of them accidentally. These are as follows:
&lt;!-- Note to editors: these below are not sections because I don't want them to appear in a list box at the top of the page. That would make the spoiler warnings useless. --&gt;

# The ring Horcrux. Very likely the first Horcrux Riddle made, and the second one discovered, this was probably made shortly before we see it on Tom's finger in his fifth or sixth year. The author has stated that it was the death of Tom Riddle Sr. that allowed the creation of this Horcrux. While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] does not believe Riddle would have wanted to continue wearing it once it was made into a Horcrux, it is possible that Riddle did not yet have any safe place to keep it at that point. He eventually hid it, magically protected, in the ruins of the Gaunt shack; it is certain that he would not actually want to hide it there until he was certain that the original occupants would not be returning. It is also certain that he did not know exactly what the ring was; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]] thought it was a signet ring bearing the coat of arms of the Peverell family, but the device etched onto the surface was, in fact, the sigil of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. The significance of the ring to Riddle was, of course, the illustration of the connection to the pure-blood Peverell family, just as it had been to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]] and Marvolo before him; and its hiding place was significant because it was the home of his mother and grandfather, and thus served as partial proof of his heritage. Professor Dumbledore had retrieved it from there; then, knowing Dumbledore was preparing to destroy it, the Horcrux apparently managed to convince him to put the ring on his finger. The resulting action of the embedded curse caused the damage to Dumbledore's hand that was apparent in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', and in fact left him with, at best, a year of life. Dumbledore managed, despite the curse, to return to his office, where he destroyed the Horcrux using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|sword of Godric Gryffindor]].
# The diary Horcrux. Likely the second one created, but the first one discovered, this was also made when Tom Riddle was still a student. The author has stated in an online chat that this Horcrux was made by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s death. Possibly an initial attempt, the value to Riddle of the diary was that it proved he was the true heir of Slytherin; interestingly, it only gained this value after it was made into a Horcrux. This is the only Horcrux that actually generates a simulacrum of Riddle, perhaps it is the only one that is actually allowed to. Hermione's reading suggests that a Horcrux can use the life-force of someone who gets emotionally close to it, using that to regenerate the person who provided the soul, and this is evidently what happened in this case: Riddle regenerated using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]'s life force. We can see that the diary took no damage from being flushed down the toilet or having ink spilled all over it, which is what we would expect given the characteristics of a Horcrux. This Horcrux was destroyed by Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] using a Basilisk fang. Dumbledore was actually disturbed by the discovery of this Horcrux; while he had suspected that Riddle had made a Horcrux, the almost cavalier way that this one was risked, solely in order to make trouble, seemed to suggest that it had a rather lower value than a Horcrux, being a ticket to immortality, ought to have.
# The locket Horcrux. This is the third Horcrux discovered, but likely the fifth made. The author has stated that it was created from the death of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] tramp. The locket is significant to Tom Riddle (now calling himself [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]) because of its direct connection to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], who espoused the same belief in pure-blood superiority that Voldemort has adopted, and because it serves as proof that he is descended from Slytherin. The first time we see it, before it is a Horcrux, it is around the neck of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]]. She evidently then sells it for a pittance, and it goes on to become one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]]'s treasures. Shortly after Hepzibah's death, it vanished; apparently Tom Riddle had, at this point, stolen it and made it into a Horcrux. As a Horcrux, it was originally hidden in the basin in the cave, which was visited by Harry and Professor Dumbledore in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. This cave was significant to Voldemort because it was one of the places where he had first exercised his superiority over Muggles, by torturing some of his fellows from the orphanage. The locket was then stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], who replaced the locket with the one that Harry and Dumbledore found, and who passed the locket on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] with instructions to destroy it. Kreacher was unable to do so. It then passed through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]'s hands to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] managed to steal it from Dolores, and eventually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] destroyed this Horcrux with the sword of Gryffindor. The locket had to be opened before it could be destroyed; Harry discovered that it would open if spoken to in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]].
# The cup Horcrux. This is the fourth Horcrux retrieved, probably the fourth one made, and according to the author was made via the death of Hepzibah Smith. The cup is significant to Voldemort because of its direct connection to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]], one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts. We first see it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]]'s memory, when Hepzibah Smith is showing off her treasures, and assume that it is stolen by Voldemort at her death, at the same time he recovers Slytherin's locket. When we next see the cup, it is locked away in a top-security vault at Gringotts. Harry believes that the location is significant to Voldemort because possession of a vault at Gringotts is proof of ancient Wizarding heritage. The vault is owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], and Voldemort is furious when the Horcrux is stolen from there. The report of the theft of the cup Horcrux starts Voldemort inspecting the places where he has hidden all his Horcruxes to confirm that they still are safe. To his fury, he finds that they are not. The cup Horcrux is carried out of Gringotts by Hermione, and destroyed by her at Hogwarts using a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] fang recovered from the Chamber of Secrets.
# The diadem Horcrux. This is the fifth Horcrux retrieved, but possibly the third one made. It was while he was at Hogwarts that Riddle had charmed (non-magically) [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|the Grey Lady]] into telling him where the lost Diadem of Ravenclaw was. The Grey Lady, in life [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s daughter, had stolen the diadem and had hidden it in Albania, in a hollow tree. She had then been murdered by the man who became [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]], before she could either retrieve it or tell anyone where it was. Riddle managed to get its location, and having retrieved it, converted it into a Horcrux, apparently by murdering an Albanian peasant, according to the author. The value of the Diadem to Voldemort was obviously its connection to Ravenclaw, one of the four Founders. Visiting Hogwarts ten years after the death of Hepzibah Smith, Voldemort had hidden the diadem in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] in its &quot;junk warehouse&quot; state. The significance of this location to Voldemort is two-fold: like Harry, Riddle found Hogwarts to be the first place that he could truly call his home, and unlike Harry, he believed that he was the only person who knew how to get into the Room of Requirement. Harry had seen, and handled, the diadem when he went into the Room of Requirement to hide his Potions textbook [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 24|in his sixth year]], but had not recognized it; of course, he had not even known it existed at that point. It is because he had used it as a marker for the place he had hidden his textbook that he was able to remember it. This Horcrux was destroyed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Vincent Crabbe]], who had learned how to create [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]] but not how to extinguish it. The fire he created would have destroyed everything in the Room of Requirement at that point, and in fact consumed him as well. We see that the Fiendfyre is tossing the Diadem through the air when Harry catches it, and it falls apart in Harry's hands, without any assistance from Harry, after he leaves the Room of Requirement; we can only assume that the Horcrux was &quot;fatally&quot; damaged by the actions of the Fiendfyre.
# Nagini. The seventh Horcrux created, and the fifth revealed, Nagini was used as something of an afterthought. Voldemort needed a sixth Horcrux to complete what he thought was the mystical number of soul pieces (seven), and Nagini was handy at the time when he was murdering [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]]. (Voldemort was unaware of the existence of the accidental Horcrux at that point, and remained so throughout the series.) Nagini had been his constant companion to that point, and after becoming a Horcrux, started showing certain human characteristics. It is certain that Nagini and Voldemort were sharing their thoughts when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|Harry viewed Nagini's attack]] on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]. Once Voldemort knew that his Horcruxes were under attack, he created protective spells around Nagini to keep her safe; but once Harry was believed dead, he no longer thought that necessary. Nagini was beheaded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], using the sword of Gryffindor which had been provided to him by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]].
# Harry. The sixth created, and the seventh one revealed, Harry, who doesn't actually merit use of the term &quot;Horcrux&quot;, was purely accidental. It was revealed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that the act of murdering Harry's parents had caused Voldemort's already shredded soul to tear again, and the detached fragment sought and attached itself to the nearest intact soul it could find, which was Harry's. This soul fragment, resident in Harry, gave him some of Voldemort's abilities, notably the ability to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|speak to snakes]], and provided him an awareness of Voldemort's thoughts and feelings throughout the seven books. Voldemort destroyed this soul fragment when he tried to kill Harry the second time, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]; he was unable to kill Harry at that time because of the blood protection Harry still carried. But the author has said that with the destruction of the soul fragment, Harry lost the ability to speak Parseltongue.

== Analysis ==

It is perhaps interesting that no person destroyed more than one Horcrux. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Dumbledore, Crabbe (indirectly: the diadem fell apart in Harry's hands after being damaged by Crabbe's fiendfyre), and Voldemort each destroyed one of the seven. This illustrates a point that Harry has been trying to make throughout the series, but only verbalizes while in the process of setting up Dumbledore's Army in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 15|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]: Harry didn't do all this stuff alone, he had loads of help.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

One question that has been debated is whether the Elder Wand, an exceptional wand, would provide sufficiently strong magic to destroy a Horcrux? We learn that a Horcrux can defend itself against any damage that could be inflicted by ordinary magic; the Elder Wand, of course, is an extraordinary magical artifact, is not its magic strong enough to destroy a Horcrux? After all, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]], cast by Voldemort at Harry using that wand, was sufficient to dispatch the soul fragment that Harry had been carrying; and the wand had not accepted Voldemort as its master at that point.

There is nothing in the books that directly addresses this question. However, it is possible to speculate, and based on that speculation, the apparent answer is that no, the magic of the Elder Wand is not sufficient in and of itself. Our reasoning is as follows: Why did Dumbledore travel all the way back to Hogwarts from the Gaunt shack, and fetch the Sword of Gryffindor out of a display case to break the ring Horcrux if the Elder Wand, of which he was the full master, could have done the job? The apparent difference is this: a Horcrux is a soul fragment that is bound to an object. What was in Harry was in fact not a proper Horcrux at all, but simply a piece of soul more or less along for the ride; as partial evidence for this, we mention that at no time did Dumbledore refer to it as a Horcrux, but always rather as a &quot;soul shard&quot; or &quot;piece of Voldemort's soul.&quot; Others, notably Severus Snape, referred to it as a Horcrux in conversation with Dumbledore, and Dumbledore did not contradict them, but also did not agree or use the term himself.

In order to speculate on what happened there, we also have to speculate on the nature of the Avada Kedavra curse. To wit: Harry's experience in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] leads us to believe that one of the effects of the Curse is to separate soul from body. But that cannot be the full effect; the Curse also works on spiders, and nobody teaches us that spiders have souls, and the end effect of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor's Kiss]] is not a dead body, but one that is merely &quot;as good as dead&quot;. So we have to assume that the Curse also damps the life force somehow... but we can assume that it did not do so in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], primarily because Voldemort still had one extant Horcrux, Nagini, even after the soul shard in Harry was dispatched. (Otherwise, Voldemort would have died in the Forest from that spell rebound.) So, the Curse separated Harry's soul, with its rider, from his body. The soul fragment, separated from Harry by the shock, would likely have tried to return to Voldemort's soul and reattach, and been rebuffed; and then would have evaporated, as the other Horcrux soul fragments apparently did.

We can also speculate that the soul fragment riding Harry, lacking the blood protection that Harry carried within him, would have been susceptible to destruction or expulsion by Voldemort's curse, at least more so than Harry would have been. While one could potentially argue that Voldemort's soul shard could be protected from Voldemort because of shared blood, that is not the case; Voldemort's blood came from Harry, and the soul shard from an earlier instance of Voldemort who was using his own flesh and blood.

It is almost certain that the magic that was used to make a Horcrux out of Nagini was the same as the magic that was used to make the other Horcruxes, in which case the soul fragment would be bound, not to Nagini's reptilian soul but to her body, and as such it would have remained intact despite Nagini's death, bound to her remains. Of course, the fact that she was killed with the Sword of Gryffindor, and its Basilisk-venom infusion, will have put an end to the Horcrux.

To conclude, then: A soul fragment bound to an object, a Horcrux, is proof against ordinary magic, even magic as strong as that produced by an extraordinary wand. (At least, evidence is that Dumbledore believed so, and we have seen nothing against that.) The soul fragment within Harry is not actually bound to him, but is merely clinging to his own soul, and as such is only as strong as Harry himself; if Harry's soul is separated from his body, the soul fragment is detached and vanishes. And the soul fragment within Nagini is bound to its container (Nagini's physical body) by the Horcrux magic, and likely would act to keep that container intact, even after Nagini's original &quot;soul&quot; or life force had vanished; it is only the sword of Gryffindor, with its dose of Basilisk venom, that is able to dispatch it.

== Peruvian style recipe ==

I don't mean to be offensive but this recipe for Arroz con pollo in the Peruvian style is ridiculous.  I spent a long time in Peru and never saw a recipe like this.  Where is the cilantro?  In Peru, Arroz con pollo is GREEN from the abundant cilantro.  There is at least a cup of blended cilantro in this dish.  Cooking sherry?  What???  Where would they get cooking sherry?  That is Spanish and I have never seen that in the common Peruvian kitchen, much less used in this recipe.  You don't marinate the chicken in citrus juices, you add the chicken after sauteing the onion and garlic.  Likewise there is no tomato sauce in any version of arroz con pollo that I ate numerous times in Peru.  I thought Wikipedia was supposed to be the authority?  Where did this crazy recipe come from?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Book/Page|prev=Chapter 20|next=Chapter 22|tab=21|title=The Tale of Three Brothers}}
== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] explains that the Deathly Hallows mark is not Dark at all, though a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|burly young man]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur's]] wedding thought it was. It is actually a sign indicating one is on a Quest for the Deathly Hallows, and it is from ''The Tale of the Three Brothers''. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has never heard of it, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] have; Hermione reads the story aloud from ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. 

Xenophilius, though uneasy, further relates how three brothers cheated Death and received artifacts from him. These were the Elder Wand, a wand that was unbeatable in a duel; a Resurrection Stone, which, when turned three times, summons souls from the afterlife to the living world; and Death's own Cloak of Invisibility. Together, these items form the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], and despite it being a fairy tale, the Three Hallows actually exist. Recalling the symbol on Ignotus Peverell's grave in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], Hermione asks if there is any connection with the Peverell family. Xenophilius says Ignotus is believed to be one of the brothers in the story. Harry privately recalls hearing the Peverell name somewhere else.

While Xenophilius prepares dinner, the Trio discuss the three Hallows. Hermione admits the wand has the best documented history. Magical history has many stories of super-powerful wands, and there seems to be a consistent link following one such wand nearly to the present. The Resurrection Stone is dismissed as being a misinterpreted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], but the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] could be the one in Harry's pocket. It has withstood the test of time, unlike ordinary invisibility cloaks that eventually become threadbare and lose their effectiveness.

Harry goes into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]]'s bedroom and notices that it is dusty and appears unused; Luna should be home for the holidays and is supposedly fishing. Harry again asks Xenophilius about Luna's whereabouts and why there are only four plates set for dinner. Xenophilius tries to prevent the Trio from leaving, then admits that &quot;they&quot; took Luna away as a punishment for his stories in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']]. Hermione spots approaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomsticks]]; Xenophilius draws his wand, but Harry pushes the other two aside. The spell hits the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Erumpent|Erumpent]] horn hanging on the wall, which explodes, blowing Xenophilius down the stairs, while the printing press drops across the staircase. Downstairs, two [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]], demand to know why Xeno summoned them and tried to blow them up. Upstairs, Hermione tosses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] over Ron, then fires a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|Memory charm]] at Xeno as he claws his way through the rubble. She [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deprimo|blasts a hole]] through the floor. As they fall, Harry sees the Death Eaters. Hermione safely [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]] them to a field.

== Analysis ==

In addition to seeking information regarding the Deathly Hallows, the Trio also came here because Xenophilius Lovegood is sympathetic, publicly, to Harry's cause. However, we see that Death Eaters have forced him to abandon this support by imprisoning his daughter, Luna. Controlling family members via state-ordered or state-backed kidnapping is common in totalitarian regimes throughout history. Considering how dangerous it is for anyone to support Harry, it is questionable as to why Xeno continued publishing ''The Quibbler'' openly at his home rather than hiding underground like so many other wizard families, or why Luna was allowed to remain at Hogwarts, which is now under Voldemort's control. But like Luna, Xeno's odd views and outlandish beliefs have warped his perception of reality, and he may simply have been oblivious to the perils, or believed he was immune to any danger. Unfortunately, this has cost his daughter's freedom, and possibly her life (and threatens his own) if he fails to cooperate with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s Death Eaters. Now Xeno will do anything to save his only child, including betraying Harry Potter. 

Viktor Krum and others believe the Deathly Hallows symbol is a Dark mark. It is possible that most people, including Krum, never understanding its true meaning or origin, associate it with evil only because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] adopted it, and, after disgracing himself at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], went on to become one of history's most notorious wizards. From then on, the Deathly Hallows symbol was forever tainted and considered &quot;Dark.&quot; That a benign image can become associated with evil is hardly unprecedented. The Nazi swastika is such a modern-day icon: its origins actually date back to ancient history as a benevolent and sacred symbol in many Asian and Middle Eastern religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and others. It is because it is also linked to ancient Indo-European people, including the Aryans, that Nazi Germany adopted it in the mid-20th century as their emblem to represent racial purity and superiority. Although Asian cultures still consider it a symbol for luck, fortune, and victory, the swastika is primarily remembered (and still utilized) in the West to symbolize white supremacy and prejudice. Presumably, this same pattern has resulted in many wizarding realms associating the Hallows mark with Grindelwald, just as the skull and snake [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark mark]] represents Voldemort, though that particular symbol had no prior benevolent connotation.

Harry now knows what the Deathly Hallows actually are, but it will take him time to completely understand their significance. The Invisibility Cloak is likely the same one that Harry owns, supporting the belief that the other Deathly Hallows exist. In particular, the Elder Wand likely has some real existence, as is shown by the documented murders that apparently follow its nearly-cohesive trail. If the Elder Wand truly exists, and Harry finds it and wins its allegiance, it could be a powerful weapon against Voldemort. Harry is once again cast into confusion; whoever controls all three Hallows is supposedly &quot;the master of Death.&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] tasked Harry to find and destroy the remaining [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]; would possessing all three Hallows make that task easier? Should he devote his energies to uniting the Hallows and thus possibly avoiding the almost certain death he faces at Voldemort's wand? Neither Harry, or we, have the answers to these questions.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Deathly Hallows that Xenophilius Lovegood mentions are real, though it is unlikely that there could be three brothers who literally tricked Death. It is believed they may be based on the Peverells, a family that both Harry and Voldemort may be descended from; it is suggested that they could be simply extremely talented wizards. Meanwhile, we will learn that the artifact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has been seeking is actually one of the Hallows, namely the Elder Wand. It is currently publicly unknown where the Elder Wand is, but it will be discovered that it was in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s possession at his death. Voldemort will discover this and retrieve the wand from Dumbledore's tomb. As legend proclaims this wand unbeatable in duels, Voldemort believes it will overpower Harry, as his own wand and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]'s were unable to. However, the story of the Three Brothers tells us that the Elder Wand's master is always vulnerable to defeat, and this is how Dumbledore not only came to possess it, but also lost its allegiance. Although Harry does not actually obtain the Elder Wand until the war's end, it will still prove to be a powerful weapon against Voldemort, for reasons that have yet to be explained.

Harry, as mentioned, seems to recall hearing the Peverell name somewhere. He will eventually remember that the ring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]] brandished under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]]'s nose in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|a memory Harry experienced]] in Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] was &quot;the ring of the Peverells&quot;. Harry has seen this ring on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s finger in a memory retrieved from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], on Dumbledore's damaged hand when he collects Harry in the summer, and lying on Dumbledore's work table. Where it is now, and what significance it has, are as yet unknown; but Harry, remembering the ring, will come to believe that the symbol of the Hallows is scribed on it, and will begin to believe that the stone in the ring is the Resurrection Stone. It will turn out that he is correct, and that, unknown to him, he is carrying the ring with him; but the ring will not be revealed to him until he has already come to terms with death, thus mastering it.

Hermione, even under pressure, reacts with great intelligence and forethought at this chapter's end. With only moments to act, she protects both the Weasley family and Xeno, while also whisking Harry, Ron, and herself away to safety. She explains in the next chapter that, by allowing the Death Eaters to see her and Harry, she protects Xeno by confirming that he sent a legitimate summons. She also uses the Invisibility Cloak to hide Ron's presence from the Death Eaters (and presumably from Xeno with the Memory Charm as well), to protect him and also his family. If Ron is discovered with Harry and Hermione, rather than confined at home with Spattergroit, Voldemort and his Death Eaters will target the Weasley family, just as they did the Lovegoods. Concealing Ron safeguards his cover provided by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghoul|Ghoul]]. Hermione's family is also in danger, but she has hidden them in Australia, with new identities and altered memories.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To do the changes below make sure you are running as Administrator.
==Interface==
The interface uses similar elements in all the panels.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| First
| Previous
| This. Edits the selected item
| Next
| Last
| Reload
| Find
| Sort (an A, Z and an arrow)
| New (a blank paper with an orange star)
| Delete (the red cross)
| Save (a floppy disk)
|}
== Setting up your Stock ==
===Taxes===
On the left side of the Screen are some menus for you to select from. Let's set up the taxes first. Under “Administration”, click “Maintenance”, and then “Taxes”.  Here you can set up tax bands that will later be associated with products. This allows taxation calculations to be performed automatically.
* After you are done, save using the save button.
* If you want to delete a tax, you can click on the delete button 
* You can add more taxes by clicking on the new button

===Categories===
The second thing you'd want to do is to setup your categories. Managing the catalog consists of setting up categories and adding products to those categories. Note that
# Categories can be nested
# Products can belong to at most one category
Under “Administration”, click “Products”, and then click the button that says “Categories.”
You will notice that the interface is very much alike to that of the taxes screen. Here you can define several categories under which you can fit your products. 
* Figure out how you want to categorize your items. This is key to avoid problems later.
* The ID needs to be numeric. It is suggested making each category an increment of 100. 
* You can also add pictures for each category, this field is, however optional.
* Make sure you save after each category.

===Products===
After you have made all of your categories, you will need to type in your products. “Administration”, “Products”, then “Edit Products”.
*Once again, each item must have it’s own unique reference. Products can have anything as reference, not just numbers.
*Figure out how much each individual item costs you, if you do not know, type in some number below what you are selling it at. This is required, so you need to type in a number to make the program happy. You can give it as many digits as you like.
*For “Sell price”, enter the amount that you intend to sell the item at (before taxes).
*Select the tax and the category this product fits in (optional).
*You can also set up the product's minimum and maximum stock under the stock tab.
*On the Properties tab you can set whether the product is displayed on the catalog. If you select the &lt;tt&gt;in Catalog&lt;/tt&gt; checkbox, the product will appear in to system users when they select the appropriate category

==Change the default ticket==
===Create a resource===
In POSper much of the advanced configuration is managed from the resources panel rather than with a GUI. Such is the case for the Tickets

To change the default ticket you must go to the Resources Panel and go to the Printer.Ticket resource
POSper uses Apache Velocity to parse the XML templates. The [http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/vtl-reference-guide.html reference to Velocity] contains further information for the syntax used.
===Editing the ticket===
In the ticket there are available all of the public methods of the class in the $ticket variable and the public methods of the class in the $ticketlines variable.

The default ticket template can serve as a good starting point.
===Editing the image===
The default image can be changed by adding a new resource of type image on the resources panel. The resource must be named Printer.Ticket.Logo
The image types supported vary by printer. Most thermal printers support them, and most dot-matrix ones don't. The image must be 256 px wide at most.

To remove the image from the ticket you have to edit the Printer.Ticket resource and remove the references to the Printer.Ticket.Logo resource
==Managing Users==
===Editing the roles===
For editing the permissions you would have to create a new role and edit the permissions in there. The format used is an XML file which describes the forms to which the role has permission to access.
The default template for the administrator role can serve as inspiration.
===Users===
Go to “Maintenance” under '''Administration''' and Select “Users”

Click on the icon with the flower on it to add a new employee. (I recommend adding yourself first). Type in the name under “Name”, and then select their role. You want them to be visible, so leave that alone. 

As far as roles go, make sure you give yourself the role of “Administrator.” Now you can go two ways. You can either make your employees “User” or “Manager.” If you give them “User”, they will only have access to the sales and the will not be able to “Close-cash during the night, or pull up a shopping list for you. However, “Manager” will give them this access. 

Personally, I recommend “Manager”. You can give them passwords, but they can do this for themselves as well. Also, I recommend that you delete the default Users (“Admin”, “Employee”, “Guest”, and “Manager”) or at least turn off their visibility. That way each employee must log on as themselves.
== Reports ==
If you need reports that are not available in POSper you'll have to make your own. It is not that hard, however, you will need some SQL knowledge on most cases.
#Gather info about your database from POSper's sidebar:  System:Configuration&gt;Database. You'll need all the information under the Database heading, including the password. (Btw, you'll have to create another username if you intend to have the app open at the same time as when you run reports.) 
#What kind of report do you want?
#What do you want to be on the report? &lt;br&gt;You can use any of the [[Using_POSper/Developer_guide/SQL_Queries|SQL Queries already made]].

=== Reporting from the Command Line ===
Here we are retrieving the information from the database using the command line tools. '''Remember SQL is case sensitive, even in Windows'''. 

'''For postgres installations:'''
&lt;br&gt;To run in Windows, save this as filename.bat and simply double-click it:
&lt;pre&gt;&quot;c:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.1\bin\psql.exe&quot; -U username -d posper -c &quot;SELECT * FROM stockdiary;&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
To create a file that you can import into (for example) excel, add this to the end:
&lt;pre&gt;-o filename&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''For MySql installations:'''
&lt;pre&gt;mysql -u username -p --execute=&quot;SELECT * FROM stockdiary;&quot; posper&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You'll need to replace &quot;username&quot; with a real username and &quot;posper&quot; with the database name (posper is default). You will be prompted for a password after you hit enter.

=== Postgres' pgAdmin ===
Extremely Easy. Once the server connection has been added, go to tools, Query Tool. You simply need to paste the query into the box.

=== iReport ===
[http://jasperforge.org/sf/projects/ireport iReport]. iReport is a tool that helps to visually create reports. POSper's reports are created on this tool.

iReport makes easy to create printable information, as it offers a feature to export to pdf and several other formats by default. For further information you can check the [http://jasperforge.org/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.ireport/wiki/HomePage iReport documentation]

=== phpMyAdmin ===
Easy. click on the SQL button and enter the query. It will return a table with the results. phpMyAdmin can also export to excel, making the data selection easier if you are used to that kind of tools.

==Troubleshooting==
===Cannot create a new record===
If you reuse an ID you will receive the error message
 Notice: Cannot create a new record.
If you select the &lt;tt&gt;Information&lt;/tt&gt; button from the error dialog, you should see the following message
&lt;pre&gt;
net.adrianromero.data.loader.DataException: 
java.sql.SQLException: Unique constraint violation:  
in statement [insert into CATEGORIES (ID, NAME, IMAGE) values (?, ?, ?)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the databases way of telling you that you have reused an ID value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Victorian Certificate of Education (Australia) contains several history courses both at Units 1/2 and Units 3/4. One such sequence is the History of Revolutions (Units 3 &amp; 4) which provides for the detailed study of two of the four following Revolutions: the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution. The two Revolutions are to be chosen by the school, and may be studied in any order (one Revolution for each Unit). Both Units comprise two Areas of Study: Area of Study 1 - Revolutionary Ideas, Leaders, Movements and Events; and Area of Study 2 - Creating a New Society. Both Areas of Study must be covered for each Revolution.

This textbook aims to provide another source of general information, activities, questions, help and primary sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Communist Revolution in 1949 was perhaps one of the most significant events of the 20th century.
In this History Unit there are two Areas of Study: &lt;br&gt;
*'''Area of Study 1: Revolutionary Ideas, Movements, Leaders and Events''' &lt;br&gt; This Area of Study covers the time from the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 until the Communist Revolution in 1949. Topics will include ideas such as Marxism, Maoism, and Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles; movements such as the Guomindang and the Chinese Communist Party; events such as the Boxer Rebellion and the Long March and leaders such as Sun Yat Sen, Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai Shek and Zhou Enlai. &lt;br&gt;
*'''Area of Study 2: Creating A New Society''' &lt;br&gt; This Area of Study covers the time from the Communist Revolution in 1949 through to the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. Topics include the Great Leap Forward, the Hundred Flowers Campaign and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

First we must note that because the Chinese language [Mandarin] uses a writing system radically different to our own, various methods of transliterating Chinese sounds have emerged. The two used most commonly are the Wades-Giles (WG) system and the Pinyin system. This textbook, in explanations, will use the Pinyin system (therefore we shall say Mao Zedong and not Mao Tse-tung), except for those names who have become widely known under a different - often Cantonese - form (e.g., we shall say Sun Yat Sen and not Sun Yixian). Rather than changing names in primary sources, however, we shall merely state which system of transliteration is used, to avoid confusion. For more detail, consult this [[/Table of Chinese names|table of Chinese names]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">From ''China and the Manchus'' by Herbert Allen Giles [out of copyright]:

There was great unrest, especially in Shantung, due, it was said, to ill-feeling between the people at large and converts to Christianity, and at any rate aggravated by recent foreign acquisitions of Chinese territory. It was thus that what was originally one of the periodical anti-dynastic risings, with the usual scion of the Ming dynasty as figure-head, lost sight of its objective and became a bloodthirsty anti-foreign outbreak. The story of the siege of the Legations has been written from many points of view; and most people know all they want to know of the two summer months in 1900, the merciless bombardment of a thousand foreigners, with their women and children, cooped up in a narrow space, and also of the awful butchery of missionaries, men, women, and children alike, which took place at the capital of Shansi. Whatever may have been the origin of the movement, there can be little doubt that it was taken over by the Manchus, with the complicity of the Empress Dowager, as a means of getting rid of all the foreigners in China. Considering the extraordinary position the Empress Dowager had created for herself, it is impossible to believe that she would not have been able to put an end to the siege by a word, or even by a mere gesture. She did not do so; and on the relief of the Legations, for a second time in her life—she had accompanied Hsien Fêng to Jehol in 1860—she sought safety in an ignominious flight. Meanwhile, in response to a memorial from the Governor of Shansi, she had sent him a secret decree, saying, &quot;Slay all foreigners wheresoever you find them; even though they be prepared to leave your province, yet they must be slain.&quot; A second and more urgent decree said, &quot;I command that all foreigners, men, women, and children, be summarily executed. Let not one escape, so that my empire may be purged of this noisome source of corruption, and that peace may be restored to my loyal subjects.&quot; The first of these decrees had been circulated to all the high provincial officials, and the result might well have been an indiscriminate slaughter of foreigners all over China, but for the action of two Chinese officials, who had already incurred the displeasure of the Empress Dowager by memorializing against the Boxer policy. These men secretly changed the word &quot;slay&quot; into &quot;protect,&quot; and this is the sense in which the decree was acted upon by provincial officials generally, with the exception of the Governor of Shansi, who sent a second memorial, eliciting the second decree as above. It is impossible to say how many foreigners owe their lives to this alteration of a word, and the Empress Dowager herself would scarcely have escaped so easily as she did, had her cruel order been more fully executed. The trick was soon discovered, and the two heroes, Yüan Ch`ang and Hsü Ching-ch`êng, were both summarily beheaded, even though it was to the former that the Empress Dowager was indebted for information which enabled her to frustrate the plot against her life in 1898.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perhaps one of the defining events of the 21st Century, the Communist Revolution in Russia in 1917 brought to power the régime that would rival the West for supremacy. In this History Unit there are two Areas of Study:

* '''Area of Study 1: Revolutionary Ideas, Movements, Leaders and Events''' &lt;br&gt;
This Area of Study covers the time from Bloody Sunday in 1905 through to the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917. Topics will include ideologies like Marxism and agrarian socialism, movements like the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Narodniks and Socialist Revolutionaries, leaders like Tsar Nicholas II, Kerensky, Lenin and Trotsky, and events such as Bloody Sunday, the February Revolution in 1917, and the First World War.
* '''Area of Study 2: Creating A New Society''' &lt;br&gt;
This Area of Study starts from the October Revolution in 1917 and concludes with the death of Lenin in 1924. The Area of Study focuses on the change and continuity with the old régime and the new. Topics will include State Capitalism, War Communism and the New Economic Policy, the Civil War and the Kronstadt uprising.

== First comment ==

After '''looking''' at ''the'' main [[page]] with w3m, a text browser I decided to add some alt text to the images. I think there should also be an alt text for Image:Go_To_A_Random_Page and Go_To_List_of_All_Textbooks, but there's a problem: it might confuse people who click on them even more. I think clicking on the pictures should give what one expects. Now you are being brought to the page about the image, which isn't very intuitive. The only way I see to change this is to use HTML... Is that ok?

I also moved links to external projects to the bottom of &quot;miscellaneous&quot;. Probably these should have their own heading... [[User:Guaka|Guaka]]

:But in Wikimedia it is standard practice to have clicking on the image give info on that image. People use this to check copyright info, find out who made an image etc. I'm not familer with text only browsers, does clicking on the alt text go to the image description page? If so why no say so ''in'' the alt text. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 11:49, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::The problem with these 2 pictures is that they make people think that if you click on them you will ''not'' be brought to copyright info and stuff like that, but that other stuff will happen. And since they're on the main page I think it might be good to make the behaviour more newby friendly. And actually, I think even long time pedians will be fooled by the appearances. People who do want to see the Image: page will probably know how to do that :) [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 13:41, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:::But that is exactly what does happen! The image description page for these two pictures is a redirect which sends them to [[special:Random page]] and [[list of all books]] [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 11:43, 14 Jan 2004 (UTC)

The welcome messages need to contain a link to the relevent language &quot;main page&quot; as well as &quot;welcome newcomers&quot;. Also as the main page is now only a navigation page to guide newcommers to we don't need all the other nav links on the top, bottom, and side. These just get in the way. Is it possible to do that. Also we need to go to the relevent wikimedia sites and change all links to wikibooks to the appropriate language wikibook main page. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 15:43, 14 Jan 2004 (UTC)

== Order of Languages ==

Recently, [[Karl Wick]] tried to place English to the top, and I undo them. Pardon me if I were rude. But I think Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Româna˘ is broken, because I cannot see them correctly. (Am I wrong?)
Moreover, frankly speaking, I think placing English (and German, Chines, French and Spanish) to the top is not the way we should go. It is ad hoc, and there will always be trouble. For example, I could think that Korean is more important than others, and another man may insist Chinese is the most important language, ... (Meaningless flames follow.)
Current ordering is somewhat alphabetical(Wikipedia uses same ordering.), and I like it. Even though I think there can be more resonable rule of ordering, the policy based on importance of language cannot be accepted.
--[[User:envia|envia]]

:Alphabetical ordering by language code makes the most sense to me. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 09:30, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:The idea is not relative importance of languages, but volume of material in each language on the site. This is frustrating as it makes me feel like my good work is going down the ###. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Well, I understand. But, how about using &quot;New books&quot;, &quot;Featured books&quot;, or &quot;Active books&quot;? --[[User:envia|envia]]

:Alphabetical order seems good. As for Karl Wick, there is no way to automatically detect if a page is a certain language. (all the english pages are not marked with a language subsection, there are no pages such as EN: Genealogy, it's just Genealogy) So, the only way is by qualitive interpretation, which will eventually lead to... *gulp* edit wars. (i havent even seen an edit war and I dont wanna see one) Unless you can quantify the size of a language, we should be going alphabetically. [[User:KirbyMeister|KirbyMeister]] 00:03, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Maybe http://wikibooks.org/ should have the languages ordered by number of articles as http://wikipedia.org/ does and that's what I think it's the best idea. --[[User:80.58.1.42|80.58.1.42]] 09:58, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== Full names or language codes? ==

Personally, I think full language names look ugly and will still look ugly when somebody finishes adding them in. Could we switch back to language codes? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 17:20, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think that by writing the names in full it's easy for a visitor to find their own language. [[user:theresa knott]]

::Could the language names at least be capitalized normally? Having them all uppercase also unnecessarily takes up space. Btw, I've heard mentions that having different domains for different languages was decided against. Could anyone tell me why? Because speakers of other languages might not know enough English to understand the interface (for example, the navigation bar). &amp;ndash; [[User:Mxn|Minh Nguy?n]] 21:59, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::: Unlikely. The same system is employed at Wikipedia, so why reinvent the wheel? -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

::::As I understand it, Wikipedia ''does'' use separate domains for each language. That way, the navigation bar, etc. are accessible to everyone, including non&amp;ndash;English speakers. &amp;ndash; [[User:Mxn|Minh Nguy?n]] 00:21, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::::::Right, so the whatever system is currently in use at Wikipedia should be imported for use here. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

:Ditto. It's better that the page should be comprehensible to the masses than understandable only to a select group. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

:I think that the languages software is part of the newer Wiki bundle thingy that is used on Wikipedia, but that there was not enough time for the overworked developers to do a new install of the software each time there are minor updates to each of the subsites, like here at Wikibooks. So, I think that eventually when the folks get time they will install it here. Lets hope. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::Agree let's hope so. In the meantime let's not worry ''too'' much about the format of the main page. It's only a temporary solution after all. [[User:Theresa Knott]]

::On [http://www.wikitravel.org Wikitravel], they have several languages within only one domain. It seems a good solution. If it works there, it should also work here. No need to change the software. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 15:14, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)

== Are the ????????????? languages correctly rendered? ==

For some reason this page sometimes indicates non-latin character languages as little boxes (see [http://wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikibooks&amp;oldid=14520]) and at other times (like now) as a row of ????.  Is the latter showing something correct to those whose machines can translate? I initially thought it was the result of vandalism, but now I'm not so sure - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:18, 14 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I was wondering the same thing.  So I dug through the history and copy-pasted the original text back. I think it was just an innocent encodings mistake at http://wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikibooks&amp;diff=13946&amp;oldid=13945  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:47, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::I'm still seeing some spurious question marks at the top of the page. Is this because my browser doesn't have a foreign language extension of some kind, or is there a mistake there. It looks like there's some '?' characters outside of the TABLE tags, which get rendered at the top of the TABLE. -- [no user name] 18:56, 19 Feb 2004

== Colored boxes and decoration ==
There is some potential here even tho how it stands right now does not look very good to me .. it goes real wide on my Mac running OS 8.6 .. Some way to use color to make the page prettier and spice it up a bit .. lets keep going to see what it can do .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I agree ^^. Making the borders - perhaps slightly thinner and darker borders?

== How to add a new language? ==

How do I add a new language to http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks (the main portal)?
I would like to add Portuguese.
Thanks.

: If you want, just type out the main text here and I'll put it with the others for you. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 12:53, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Could we add Welsh (&quot;Cymraeg&quot;) - with this welcome text (Croeso i lyfrau-Wici! Rydym yn datblygu llyfrau sydd yn rhad ac am ddim.) Thanks!

== Change in Format? ==
Alright well I already accidentally bothered the people at wikipedia about this. But i was wondering if perhaps instead of having this educational resource based on the text book format we could create a new format which would allow for easier learning and writing.

Anyways my idea is instead of having many different &quot;wikibooks&quot; for many different subjects. You could have one. This way you can work ontop of the &quot;shoulders&quot; of other peoples works. In order for such a thing to be practical it would have be in a  heirarchial tree of sorts. so for example:

                         MATH
           Addition &lt;-----^-------&gt;Roman Numbers &lt;---&gt; Arabic numbers
 Subtraction&lt;--^----&gt; multiplication&lt;--&gt; shapes
   ^-----division--------^                  ^
              ^-------------(skip a few)----^
         Calculus &lt;--------^       ^------&gt; trigonometry
                        (skip quite a few more)           Einstein
                  Theory of Relativity &lt;--^----------------^

This isn't really how any howto has ever been built as far as i know. Nor have any textbooks have been writen in percisly this matter though have come close. But then again no one before had hyperlinks. The nice thing about this form of learning is that it works like the human mind, a relational database. 

If this will be the structure, then people wouldn't feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they would have to do to start a &quot;wikibook&quot; because the sections will be so much smaller and less needfull of administration. People that want to help will be able to as they could fill in holes in the &quot;wiki learning web&quot;. They could easily add things they know because of the &quot;modularity&quot;.

If people do decide to use wikibooks as an educational resource then they would be able to choose the extent to which they wish to teach a topic. Such a format would allow for ultimate customization of the layout of the textbook as you can pluck chunks out of the web and make it into a textbook.

'''summary'''

To summarize you just need a layout like wikipedia's simply with dynamic &quot;articles&quot; that have &quot;parent&quot; links to the things you should know before trying to read the current topic. With &quot;related&quot; links that tell of related material you might find interesting and with &quot;children&quot; links that say where you can go from what you already know.

--[[User:Azgorodin|Azgorodin]] 13:22, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Interesting concept, but I dont see how every subject can fit into that hierarchy, or any hierarchy, for that matter. Plus, wikibooks doesnt control the books that are created, or where people would choose to enter them into the table. I think that if background information is required, each individual wikibook can make the effort to point to the necessary information sources (hopefully other wiki-information sources). Let each book say what the background information is, in the method that they choose is best. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 02:34, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== Name change ==

I think that the name &quot;Wikibooks&quot;, even though it was suggested by me, was a bit odd for this page. So I added &quot;[[Wiktionary:portal|portal]]&quot; to it. If anybody is really mad about that, then go ahead and change it back. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 09:50, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I think y'all should know that I created a very useful MediaWiki: page, [[Template:Toplink]]. You place &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:Toplink}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end of a section on ''any'' page and it provides a sweet top link like the one at the bottom of this page.

==Emphasize Lessons instead of full-course text books ?==
As shown in the article &quot;Collective action&quot; in wikipedia, contribution of teaching text would be easier to get on Lesson-size text (i.e. material for a 2-hour lesson), instead of a course-size text (i.e. material for a 30-hour module).  It looks to me that the current focus of wikibooks is too much on books, not on lesson. Should we call it &quot;wikiLessons&quot; instead ? [[User:62.4.190.23|62.4.190.23]] 16:53, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Hello. Actually, most people have been doing this already by making each chapter or section of the books around 2-3 hours of reading and practice time. I'm sure you would find that you could learn quite some amount on physics or get a good grasp of polish in a few hours.

==Browsing interface==
Wouldn't it be kind of normal to have a the Browing interface done in the diffent, languages????!!!! For exemple if I am on Wikilivres (the french version of wikibooks), shouldn't the &quot;navigation&quot;, &quot;search&quot; and &quot;toolbox&quot; browsing frame also be in french, like it is for wikipedia? Suppose I am browsing books in spanish, if I click on the &quot;wikiversity&quot; link in the navigation box shouldn't I be lead to the spanish wikiversidad page???

I beleive there are two possible solutions, either, like it is the case for wikipedia, wikilivre is divided into differnent language sections. Or, what might be preferable, simply let the user choose the language of the browsing interface, and make the links correspond to the language.

==Links at bottom of page==

What are those links at the bottom of the page? Are they vandalism or similar projects, or what? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:18, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)

These Chinese adult links should be deleted ASAP!

&lt;nowiki&gt;Insert non-formatted text here&lt;/nowiki&gt;== Arabic Farsti Hebrew etc ==

Hoi,&lt;br&gt;
I have started a language class for Farsi and, to learn a language, there are two parts; the instructions in English/whatever and the material that SHOULD go right to left. This is the reason why I need both articles in the fa: and the standard wikibooks.

== Ideas on learning languages ==

Hoi,&lt;br&gt;
In the Farsi language course we have soundfiles for the individual words and sentences. These have been loaded on Commons. At the same time, we want to have all the words defined in Wiktionary. By combining these things, it will be easier learn the pronunciation and it will enrich wiktionary at the same time.

With the plans for &quot;Ultimate Wiktionary&quot; we have the idea of &quot;concepts&quot;. Concepts are translations and synonyms. When a language course has been translated in Wiktionary, the idea is that you can use language material created for one language for the new language as well. The language of the User Interface would serve as the &quot;known language&quot;. (This is known with release 1.4 of the Mediawiki software)

For things like &quot;language immersion&quot; we could have photo's/pictures like &quot;Boy behind the tree&quot;, &quot;Boy in front of the tree&quot;; these foto's could be used as &quot;Jongen achter de boom&quot;, &quot;Jongen voor de boom&quot;. By translating the text and record the text it would be usable to learn yet another language.

To learn the characters and sounds of a language, you would have some startup lessons, introducing the alfabet and some easy words. 

For grammar etc you can have lessons seperate from the language immersion stuff. This stuff would also be good to learn standard phrases for holydays; stuff like &quot;Dos cervesas por favor&quot; [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] 20:06, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Import HOWTOs and docs from The Linux Documentation Project? ==

I first posted this on [[wikisource:Scriptorium]], and 
[[wikisource:User:ThomasV|ThomasV]] said this place was more appropriate:

[[wikipedia:en:Linux Documentation Project|The Linux Documentation Project]] 
([http://www.tldp.org]) is a very nice thing, but I notice a lot of the HOWTOs 
and documentation is pretty out of date.
This could be a result of the single-author policy on all the documents, no 
changes and updates go into the documents if not the author is around or have 
the interest in updating the docs.

I don't want to fork TLDP, but wouldn't it be worthwhile to import the HOWTO 
collection and some of the documentation into Wikibooks? I'm sure this would 
boost the update process, and the authors could also import the updates done 
here into their documents at tldp.

Or would this be a disfavour to TLDP? -- [[User:sunny256|sunny256]] 2005-03-12 
13:56Z (Posted here 2005-03-13 06:04Z)

I agree that it would be interesting to at least ''try'' using wiki for Linux HOWTOs.
Perhaps we could try the
[http://CommunityWiki.org/SentenceToPageToSectionToWiki SentenceToPageToSectionToWiki] process
for a few HOWTOs at one of the [http://wiki.debian.net/?WikiNode Linux wiki]
such as
* http://wiki.LinuxQuestions.org/
* WikiBooks:[[FLOSS Concept Booklet]]
* WikiBooks:[[Linux-Compendium]]

== Language names on the portal list (suggestion) ==

Compare this portal list to the one at [[:wikisource:]]. They are very similar, but there the list is by the two-letter language codes, here by the name of the language in that language.

Suggestion: Change the Wikibooks list to '''both''', i.e. the two-letter language code, followed by the language. This would allow people to identify the languages with more ease, plus give the list a clear, objective order (Latin alphabetical). [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 20:49, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

== CANT ==

The new listing for Cantonese points to a Wikibooks that doesn't exist. There isn't even a Wikipedia with this code. Please clarify, otherwise the listing should be deleted.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 12:15, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

== Ido Wikibooks ==

Hi, could we get a Wikibooks set up for the language Ido? io. Here is what it will say:

Bonveno a Wikilibri. Hike ni developas ed adkargas libre uzata texti, studial programi, ed altra libri.

(somebody else might come along and revise it but it should do for now)

Thank you.

== This page needs attention ==

The link to the anglo-saxon wikibooks site (first link) appears to go straight to the English site.

On a separate note, this page is seriously lacking in user friendliness - having a list of languages in alphabetical order is all very well, but means that anyone who doesn't speak any of the languages they see on the first page of text is confronted by a page of unfathomable text.  We need prominent links to major languages near the top; languages like Anglo Saxon which noone, anywhere, speaks as a first language should have much less prominence.

I think ''Üdvözlet a Wikikönyvben.'' should been corrected to ''Üdvözlünk a Wikikönyvekben!'' or - more good(?) - ''Üdvözlünk a Wikikönyveken!''(?) or &gt;&gt;&gt; ''Üdvözlünk a Wikikönyvek lapjain!''.

Oh, and it should say:

''Bonveno a Wikibooks. Hike ni facas libri, lerno-libri e texti, gratuita ed editebla da irgu.''

== Missing languages from list ==

Many of the wikibooks sites are missing from this portal list.  See [http://www.bloglines.com/public/inactivewikipedias inactivewikipedias] for a large list (but ignore the dk.wikibooks.org error). --[[User:Zigger|Zigger]] 03:24, 3 December 2005 (UTC)


==multiple text problem in phrase-showcasing==
I think multiple transliteration systems should be an option. Today, having more than one transliteration system used in your wikibook (For example: transliterating phrases) requires the page to display all the transliterations systems.
Instead, the user should be able to choose at the top of the page which transliteration system to show. The ones that the user did not select, should not display. The user could also choose to show many transliteration systems.

So for a phrase for example in Arabic:

I'll call this a texta. a place where multiple instances (i.e. different versions) of the same text exist together. And for every wikibook, they could be organized, and then any page that wants to show it would just have a link to the texta. by the way, I just came up with that word &quot;texta&quot;.
1:شكرا    
2: شُكْرًا (fully vowellized)
3: shokran    (latin transliteration)
4: shuk-ran   (syllable form)
5: [Some IPA rendering]
6: shukraN           (practical phonemic translteration decided on)

And there are probably far more transliteration systems. And so every form, should be stored, and then the user can choose in the preferences for that wikibook what they want to see, (the option could be at the side). 

I believe this would be much easier than having two separate pages, just so that those wanting to use transliteration and those who don't can still use the same book.

So the author would write the con-current text for a phrase once and everyone can use which ever writing systems they want and can add their own if they contribute to the wikibook.

This would only effect wikibooks showing translations, and using more than one writing system for a foreign language. The authors of the Chinese wikibook require something like this so that they can show phrases in the traditional writing system and the other style, while still letting the user choose whether to view one, or both, or just pinyin (a transliteration system).

== E-Prime ==
Could E-Prime be added to the list of languages? (I am not intending this as a joke). Or would be best to post books in E-Prime under English? - MatthewKarlsen

:If you want to request a new language edition of Wikibooks, please make the request on [[meta:Requests for new languages|the Wikimedia Meta Wiki]].  Many languages have already been created that are not specifically mentioned on this list, but are not listed due to the lack of any substantial content.  Make sure you check on [[Special:SiteMatrix]] to see if the language is listed (from the ISO standard international language codes).  If you are active in a language not listed here, please let us know, and we will try to get it added.  I'm also monitoring [[meta:List of Wikibooks]], which lists most of the currently &quot;active&quot; Wikibooks, based on a quick survey of Wikibooks projects I did a couple of months ago.  Active meant it actually had some real content on the front page and more than one registered user.  I know that is a very low bar to set, but it at least is something to compare against.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:29, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

== Dutch ==

In the Dutch description, ''open content leerboeken'' should be replaced by either ''opencontentleerboeken'' or ''open-contentleerboeken''.

:Done, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:57, 24 March 2006 (UTC)


In the Dutch description, opencontentleerboeken is really ugly. It should be open-content leerboeken, as it is not one word.
:That was me... [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 16:35, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

It ''is'' one word. Writing it with spaces in it is a case of [[w:nl:Engelse ziekte (taal)|English disease]]. A hyphen between ''open'' and ''content'' would be acceptable, though. Or else it could be phrased differently, like ''vrije leerboeken'' or something of the like. [[w:nl:Gebruiker:David|David]] 21:03, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

== Macedonian wikibooks ==
The Macedonian language ([http://mk.wikibooks.org mk.wikibooks.org]) is missing in the list. --misos

Please change the ''open-cotent textbooks'' in the hebrew headline to ''ספרי לימוד ומדריכים חופשיים'', and the &quot;700+ modules&quot; to &quot;700+ עמודים&quot;. thank you. [[User:Ek7|Ek7]] 21:24, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

:Please make sure that I got it working correctly and didn't mess it up.  Working with mixed directional alphabet systems (hebrew and latin simultaneously) can really be tricky.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:02, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

::It's fine, thanks. [[User:Ek7|Ek7]] 19:09, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

== Macedonian Wikibooks ==

We really ought to be listing Macedonian as one of the highlighted Wikibooks. I'm not sure how best to do it. Should we drop one off so that there are 12 languages highlighted. Highlighting 13 isn't so easy aesthetically, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

== Armenian Wikibooks Missing ==

I have found two errors regarding the [http://hy.wikibooks.org Armenian Wikibooks].  For one, a link to it does not show up on this portal.  Two, on the English homepage there is a link reading &quot;Հայերեն (Armenian)&quot; but this is a link to http://ar.wikibooks.org, which is the Arabic Wikibooks.  &quot;ar&quot; doesn't belong to Armenia - it's &quot;hy&quot; for ''Hayastan'' (meaning Armenia) or ''Hayeren'' (meaning Armenian).  Just thought I'd point that little problem out.  Thanks --- [[User:Rappo|Rappo]] 19:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:Oops.  Sorry about that.  My mistake.  I guess I was getting a little too punchy with copying over the names of several new Wikibooks language projects to the main page on en.wikibooks.  I do realize that Armenians don't speak Arabic (which is also listed).
:As far as not appearing on the portal, I would suggest that you try to get a few more modules going for the Armenian Wikibooks.  Right now, the rough limit I've been using for adding new languages is that it must have over 100 Wikibook modules before it is listed on the main portal.  An active Wikibook user would easily be able to get content to this threshold, and is generally considered to be a sign that a project is definitely active or has signficant development from multiple users.  If you insist, I still can add this language here, however.  There is no hard policy for adding languages here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

::I don't really know enough Armenian to contribute to the Armenian Wikibooks... so I guess that's somebody else's job.  I didn't know about the guideline - makes sense, though.  I just saw &quot;All languages&quot; and thought it was missing.  I undesrtand now - thanks! ---- [[User:Rappo|Rappo]] 20:59, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Calling Virtuals During Initialization&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Simulate calling of virtual functions during object initialization.

=== Also Known As ===
Dynamic Binding During Initialization idiom

=== Motivation ===
Sometimes it is desirable to invoke virtual functions of derived classes
while a derived object is being initialized. Language rules explicitly
prohibit this from happening because calling member functions of derived 
object before derived part of the object is initialized is dangerous.
It is not a problem if the virtual function does not access data members
of the object being constructed. But there is no general way of ensuring 
it. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 class Base {
 public:
   Base();
   ...
   virtual void foo(int n) const; // often pure virtual
   virtual double bar() const;    // often pure virtual
 };
 
 Base::Base()
 {
   ... foo(42) ... bar() ...
   // these will not use dynamic binding
   // goal: simulate dynamic binding in those calls
 }
 
 class Derived : public Base {
 public:
   ...
   virtual void foo(int n) const;
   virtual double bar() const;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Solution and Sample Code ===

There are multiple ways of achieving the desired effect. Each has its
own pros and cons. In general the approaches can be divided into two
categories. One using two phase initialization and other one using only
single phase initialization.

Two phase initialization technique separates object construction from
initializing its state. Such a separation may not be always possible.
Initialization of object's state is clubbed together in a separate
function, which could be a member function or a free standing function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Base {
 public:
   void init();  // may or may not be virtual
   ...
   virtual void foo(int n) const; // often pure virtual
   virtual double bar() const;    // often pure virtual
 };
 
 void Base::init()
 {
   ... foo(42) ... bar() ...
   // most of this is copied from the original Base::Base()
 }
 
 class Derived : public Base {
 public:
   Derived (const char *);
   virtual void foo(int n) const;
   virtual double bar() const;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

* using non-member function

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class Derived, class Parameter&gt;
std::auto_ptr &lt;Base&gt; factory (Parameter p)
{
  std::auto_ptr &lt;Base&gt; ptr (new Derived (p));
  ptr-&gt;init (); 
  return ptr;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
A non-template version of this approach can be found here.
The factory function can be moved inside base class but it 
has to be static.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Base {
  public:
    template &lt;class D, class Parameter&gt;
    static std::auto_ptr &lt;Base&gt; Create (Parameter p)
    {
       std::auto_ptr &lt;Base&gt; ptr (new D (p));       
       ptr-&gt;init (); 
       return ptr;
    }
};
int main ()
{
  std::auto_ptr &lt;Base&gt; b = Base::Create &lt;Derived&gt; (&quot;para&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Constructors of class Derived should be made private to prevent users
from accidentally using them. Interfaces should be easy to use correctly 
and hard to use incorrectly - remember? The factory function should then
be friend of the derived class. In case of member create function, Base
class can be friend of Derived.

* Without using two phase initialization
Achieving desired effect using a helper hierarchy is described here but an
extra class hierarchy has to be maintained, which is undesirable. Passing
pointers to static member functions is C'ish.
Curiously Recurring Template Pattern idiom can be useful in this situation.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Base {
};
template &lt;class D&gt;
class InitTimeCaller : public Base {
  protected:
    InitTimeCaller () {
       D::foo ();
       D::bar ();
    }
};
class Derived : public InitTimeCaller &lt;Derived&gt; 
{
  public:
    Derived () : InitTimeCaller &lt;Derived&gt; () {
		cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Derived::Derived()\n&quot;;
	}
    static void foo () {
		cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Derived::foo()\n&quot;;
	}
    static void bar () {
		cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Derived::bar()\n&quot;;
	}
};
&lt;/source&gt;
Using Base-from-member idiom more complex variations of this idiom can be 
created.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Execute-Around Pointer&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Provide a smart pointer object that transparently executes actions before and after each function call on an object, given that the actions performed are the same for all functions.&lt;ref&gt;Execute Around Sequences - Kevlin Henney&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Also Known As ===
Double application of smart pointer.

=== Motivation ===
Often times it is necessary to execute a functionality before and after every
member function call of a class. For example, in a multi-threaded application
it is necessary to lock before modifying the data structure and unlock it afterwards. In a data structure visualization application might be interested
in the size of the data structure after every insert/delete operation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
using namespace std;
class Visualizer {
    std::vector &lt;int&gt; &amp; vect;
  public:
    Visualizer (vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;v) : vect(v) {}
    void data_changed () {
       std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Now size is: &quot; &lt;&lt; vect.size();
    }
};
int main () // A data visualization application.
{
  std::vector &lt;int&gt; vector;
  Visualizer visu (vector);
  //...
  vector.push_back (10);
  visu.data_changed ();
  vector.push_back (20);
  visu.data_changed ();
  // Many more insert/remove calls here
  // and corresponding calls to visualizer.
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Such a repetition of function calls is error-prone and tedious. It would
be ideal if calls to visualizer could be automated. Visualizer could be
used for std::list &lt;int&gt; as well. Such funcitonality which is not a part of single class but rather cross cuts multiple classes is commonly known as aspects. This particular idiom is useful for designing and implementing simple aspects.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class VisualizableVector {
  public:
    class proxy {
      public:
        proxy (vector&lt;int&gt; *v) : vect (v) {
          std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Before size is: &quot; &lt;&lt; vect-&gt;size ();
        }
        vector&lt;int&gt; * operator -&gt; () {
          return vect;
        }
        ~proxy () {
          std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;After size is: &quot; &lt;&lt; vect-&gt;size ();
        }
      private:
        vector &lt;int&gt; * vect;
    };
    VisualizableVector (vector&lt;int&gt; *v) : vect(v) {}    
    proxy operator -&gt; () {
       return proxy (vect);
    }
  private:
    vector &lt;int&gt; * vect;
};
int main()
{
  VisualizableVector vecc (new vector&lt;int&gt;);
  //...
  vecc-&gt;push_back (10); // Note use of -&gt; operator instead of . operator
  vecc-&gt;push_back (20);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Overloaded -&gt; operator of visualizableVector creates a temporary proxy
object and it is returned. Constructor of proxy object logs size of
the vector. The overloaded -&gt; operator of proxy is then called and it 
simply forwards the call to the underlying vector object by returning a
raw pointer to it. After the real call to the vector finishes, destructor
of proxy logs the size again. Thus the logging for visualization is
transparent and the main function becomes free from clutter. This idiom
is a special case of Execute Around Proxy, which is more general and
powerful. 

The real power of the idiom can be derived if we combine it judiciously
with templates and chain the overloaded -&gt; operators.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/117.223.225.71|117.223.225.71]] ([[User talk:117.223.225.71|talk]]) to last version by Alkurian</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook is about educational psychology--the study of how learning and teaching occur in educational settings. It is divided into chapters as listed below, which are preceded by an introduction that describes the features of the book in some detail. Initially most of the contributions have been made by myself, [[User Talk: Klseifert | Kelvin Seifert]], a professor of educational psychology at the University of Manitoba, Canada, though Chapter 10 and 11 (about assessment of learning) were drafted primarily by [http://www.csuohio.edu/coehs/faculty/list/candf/rsutton Rosemary Sutton], a professor of educational psychology at Cleveland State University. This may change over time--others may join, and eventually I may leave. If you wish to contact me try leaving a note on my [[User Talk: Klseifert | talk page]].

The sections below introduce the features of the book. If you want to skip the introduction, go directly to the [[#Table of Contents|Table of Contents]].

==Features of ''Contemporary Educational Psychology''==
The book is divided into thirteen chapters, each dealing with topics, themes, and examples that represent one way of understanding educational psychology (admittedly my way, at least when the book was first posted). The overall organization resembles that of many commercial ed psych texts, but a careful look will show that it is definitely not identical with others.

===Paralleling the PRAXIS II &quot;Principles of Learning and Teaching&quot;===
A key difference is that content is intended to parallel the content of the commonly used PRAXIS II test called “Principles of Learning and Teaching” (PLT), published by the [http://www.ets.org Educational Testing Service]&lt;ref&gt;Educational Testing Service. (2004). ''Study Guide for 'Principles of Learning and Teaching, 2nd edition.'' Princeton, NJ: Author&lt;/ref&gt;. The PLT test is required in 25-30 American states for persons seeking permanent certification as public school teachers. If you happen to live in a U.S. state requiring a licensure exam for becoming a teacher, you may be familiar with the PRAXIS tests, and hopefully will appreciate the way this Wikibook is organized. 

The decision to organize according to the PLT was based on the assumption that preparing for this exam would be easier if the text content mapped onto PLT topics in a straightforward, one-to-one manner. This is admittedly a rather simple assumption, but one that seemed at least worth trying. It has proved easier to implement for some topics and chapters than for others. You must of course be the ultimate judge of the book's success in mapping onto the PLT. Your assessment will depend a lot on your particular needs in preparing for licensure as a teacher. In any case, since this is a Wikibook, suggestions (on the discussion pages) or editing (on the &quot;real&quot; pages) are especially welcome.

Using the PLT as an organizing device, along with posting this book as a Wiki, are the two ways that [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] differs from the major commercially available textbooks about educational psychology.  If you do not live in a PRAXIS-using American state, or if you live outside the United States, the PLT-related feature of the organization will not much matter to you, one way or another, though you may still (hopefully) appreciate the online, open-source status of this particular textbook.

===Structure of the book===
As of this current revision, all chapters have the following parts:
:* Table of Contents
:* Body of the chapter itself (this is the longest part of each chapter-file)
:* Links to tables and figures discussed in the chapter--mostly just promised, not yet actual
:* Chapter summary (less than one page when printed)

What is still to be added will be partly up to you as readers. In the opinion of [[User: Klseifert | KelvinLeeSeifert]], further enhancements might include these features, in whole or in part:
:* List of key terms from the chapter
:* List of external Internet websites relevant to the chapter
:* Complete references cited in the chapter (most of these are listed at the bottom of their relevant subpages, and some may overlap a bit from one chapter to another)
:* More descriptions of a teaching experiences relevant to the chapters and sections (in addition to those already embedded in the text)
:* More in-depth analyses of selected research issues or studies (in addition to those already in the text)
:* Photographs relevant to particular written content

==What's NOT in ''Contemporary Educational Psychology''==
Since this book is not published commercially, it contains no pictures or elegant graphics--at least initially. It is also missing some of the teaching or &quot;pedagogical&quot; aids of some commercial books, such as a glossary of definitions or a website of supplementary materials. To get a permanent copy of a chapter or a section, you have to print the material for yourself. Some passages may seem a bit “American” in content, a fact that is likely to be noticeable and possibly annoying to some non-American readers. Whether these differences really are important will be for you to decide.

If it really is important for this book to resemble a conventional commercial textbook, then the material posted here can certainly be revised in that direction by additional contributions (including by contributions from yourself) over time. It is worth noting, though, that textbook styles vary significantly by country of origin and by field of study; the highly feature-enhanced style of some commercial texts is a strictly American phenomenon. For leads on what other styles are possible, check [http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Textbook_genres_and_examples Edutech], a sort of hybrid blog/wiki based in Geneva, Switzerland.

''Contemporary Educational Psychology'' is also related to a student-written wiki about educational psychology, found at [http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Educational_psychology The Learning Technology Commons] of the University of Manitoba. The two wikis are similar in initial organization of content, but they serve very different purposes and therefore may evolve in different directions over time. This Wikibook ''(Contemporary Educational Psychology)'' began with a “snapshot” of educational psychology taken at one point in time (2006-2007), as understood originally by two persons, [[User talk:Klseifert | Kelvin Seifert]] and [http://www.csuohio.edu/coehs/faculty/list/candf/rsutton Rosemary Sutton]. Since Seifert and Sutton began with the expectation of writing a conventional university textbook, the initial posted draft has some of the earmarks of a printed text.

The [http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Educational_psychology student-written wiki-text] about educational psychology began with the same table of contents as this Wikibook, but students were assigned the task of adding to and revising their own material. This circumstance may lead to the two online wiki-texts to begin with similar content, but to diverge eventually. Time will tell, however, how much this will happen.

==Table of Contents==
This is a &quot;brief&quot; Table of Contents&quot; in that it contains chapter titles only. Each chapter title links to a detailed table of contents for the chapter--one showing sections and subsections--and these in turn (of course) link to the actual material of the book.

Some of this needs to be re-written as Diabetic Coma would mean a victim is unconscious. The way the book talks about it, it acts as if the patient is alert. I've changed the two titles to Hypo and Hyperglycemia, as those are the correct terms for conscious victims.--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 03:24, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

:If you guys don't mind, I'd like to re-write this section tomorrow while I am at work. If no one else is willing to make a major change I will go ahead as planned. (I state major change because I plan on re-writing a lot, and I do not wish anyone else to do the same only to have it go to mine once I upload it.)--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 02:46, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Börek''' is a general term in Turkish cuisine that applies to a family of pastries with about fifty different members.  They have in common the fact that they are all pastry layers of some type enclosing a filling. There are two basic methods, one consists of rolling out very thin sheets of dough, called [[w:en:yufka|yufka]] in Turkish and [[w:en:phyllo|phyllo]] in Greek.  The other main type of börek uses a dough very similar to ''[[Cookbook:Puff pastry|pâte feuilletée]]'' in which the dough is layered with butter, folded, and rolled out several times, called ''[[w:en:nemse börek|nemse börek]]'' in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Algar, Ayla Esen (1985) ''The Complete Book of Turkish Cooking'' ISBN 0-710-30334-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The following recipe describes the procedure required to prepare triangular shaped börek from commercially produced phyllo.  Links to recipes for fillings are listed at the end of the recipe.

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups prepared filling
* 1 box yufka/phyllo pastry sheets&lt;ref&gt;Available from Turkish, Greek, Armenian and Middle-Eastern grocers, among others, as well as some supermarkets.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melted butter or high quality vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. peanut, hazelnut, walnut, almond, grapeseed. Avoid anything with a greasy taste such as corn oil.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
&lt;br&gt;
*Always follow all [[w:en:Food safety|FOOD SAFETY]] precautions when preparing food.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Wrapping börek.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Making börek triangles.]]
#Remove the  phyllo sheets from the container. Unfold carefully so as not to break them. Lay them flat and cover with a clean, damp tea towel to prevent them from drying out.  This is important.
# Working quickly, cut the phyllo into lengthwise thirds. (Step 1. in the diagram.) Lay one of these out and cover the other two with the damp tea towel.
# Brush the strip of phyllo with the melted butter.  Place a heaped teaspoonful of filling on one end of the strip. (Step 2. in the diagram.)
#Fold the right lower corner upward over the filling to form a triangle. (Step 3. in the diagram.)
#Now fold the right upper corner over to the left (Step 4. in the diagram.)
#Continue folding in this manner until you reach the end of the strip.
#Trim of any excess dough and seal the edges by rubbing a damp finger over the dough and pressing the edge of the triangle where the strip ends.
#Fry in oil at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|340ºF]] until golden brown or bake at 350ºF for 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Prewrapped, uncooked börek freezes well. To cook, bake at 325ºF for 30 minutes.  Do not deep-fry frozen foods.  Splattering oil can cause burns and fires.  You may sautée them in a covered pan 2 or 3 at a time.  Hold the cover in front of your face as you place each börek in the pan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fillings===

*Kıymalı Börek - Minced meat filling
*Tavuklu Börek - Chicken filling
*Ispanaklı Börek - Spinach filling

=== Me on wikibooks ===
I love the idea of wikibooks. Not all information is encyclopaedic, so let's make other types of books!

But...  I'm not sure if the process of writing a book,  of composing the narrative, is suited to wiki style collaboration. The problems are evident in various place here. For example I'm interested in  learning [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. But there's lots of different ways to teach a language. Different ways of ordering the lessons etc. Hence different people try to [[Talk:Portuguese/Contents#Separate_wikibook_Brazilian_Portuguese|write the same book in different ways]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|abstract}}

The keyword {{C sharp|base}} describes that you would like to refer to the base class for the requested information, not in the current instantiated class.

A {{C sharp|base}} class is the class in which the currently implemented class inherits from. When creating a class with no defined base class, the compiler automatically uses the {{C sharp|System.Object}} base class.

Therefore the two declarations below are equivalent.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class MyClass
{
}

public class MyClass : System.Object
{
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Some of the reasons the base keyword is used is:

* Passing information to the base class's constructor

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class MyCustomException : System.Exception
{
     public MyCustomException() : base() {}

     public MyCustomerException(string message, Exception innerException) : base(message,innerException) {}

     // ......
}
&lt;/source&gt;

* Recalling variables in the base class, where the newly implemented class is overriding its behaviour

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class MyBaseClass
{
     protected string className = &quot;MyBaseClass&quot;;
}

public class MyNewClass : MyBaseClass
{
     protected new string className = &quot;MyNewClass&quot;;

     public override string BaseClassName
     {
          get { return base.className; }
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

* Recalling methods in the base class. This is useful when you want to add to a method, but still keep the underlying implementation. 

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;

// Necessary using's here

public class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
     protected void InitializeCulture()
     {
          System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture =
                              CultureInfo.GetSpecificCulture(Page.UICulture);

          base.InitializeCulture();
     }
}

&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The writing in this book should be suitable for 6-7 year olds. At this age, reading is still a chore for many kids. Use words sparsely and maintaining a low syllable count on each page. 

The book shows pictures of people all over the world working. Each page has job title, the name of a country, and a description of the action in the photograph. Along with the photo there would be a location map of the country and that country's flag. There is also an open-ended question for the reader to think about that encourages him or her to look more closely at the photograph. 

People featured in the photographs will generally be shown enjoying their jobs and dressed in distinctive clothing, or manipulating tools associated with the job. Ideally the image would have some iconic relationship to the country described. For instance in Guatemala, many people travel by bus so a Bus Driver is an iconic image for that country. However this is not crucial. 

Photographs should be cropped to 600x600. A good quality photograph is important and photos should reveal details of facial expression whenever possible. The background colors used for the information bar generally reflect colors in the photograph and are chosen to contrast with, but not to clash with, the country's flag. 

Most of these photos were harvested from Creative Commons copyleft images published on flickr.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|implicit}}

===General===

When values are cast implicitally, the runtime does not need any casting in code by the developer in order for the value to be converted to its new type.

Here is an example, where the developer is casting &lt;i&gt;explicitly&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// Example of explicit casting.
float fNumber = 100.00f;
int iNumber = (int) fNumber;
&lt;/source&gt;

The developer has told the runtime, &quot;I know what I'm doing, force this conversion.&quot;

Implicit casting means that runtime doesn't need any prompting in order to do the conversion. Here is an example of this.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// Example of implicit casting.
byte bNumber = 10;
int iNumber = bNumber;
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that no casting was necessary by the developer. What is special about implicit is that the context that the type is converted to is totally lossless, i.e. converting to this type loses no information. So, it can be converted back without worry.

===Keyword===

The keyword {{C sharp|implicit}} is used for a type to define how to can be converted implicitly. It is used to define what types can be converted to without the need for explicit casting.

As an example, let us take a Fraction class, that will hold a nominator (the number at the top of the division), and a denominator (the number at the bottom of the division). We will add a property so that the value can be converted to a {{C sharp|float}}.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class Fraction
{
     private int nominator;
     private int denominator;

     public Fraction(int nominator1, int denominator1)
     {
          nominator = nominator1;
          denominator = denominator1;
     }

     public float Value { get { return (float)_nominator/(float)_denominator; } }

     public static implicit operator float(Fraction f)
     {
          return f.Value;
     }

     public override string ToString()
     {
          return _nominator + &quot;/&quot; + _denominator;
     }
}

public class Program
{
    [STAThread]
     public static void Main(string[] args)
     {
          Fraction fractionClass = new Fraction(1, 2);
          float number = fractionClass;

          Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} = {1}&quot;, fractionClass, number);
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To re-iterate, the value it implicitally casts to &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; hold data in the form that the original class can be converted back to. If this is not possible, and the range is narrowed (like converting {{C sharp|double}} to {{C sharp|int}}), use the explicit operator.

: ''She looked around the classroom, enjoying a blessed moment of quiet after the students finally left at the end of the day. “Ashley the teacher, that’s me.” she said proudly to the empty room. “But why am I doing this?” she added quietly—and realized she wasn’t always sure of the answer herself. But then she remembered one good reason: she was teaching for Nadia, who sat at the table to the left, always smiled so well and always (well, usually) tried so hard. And another reason: she was teaching for Lincoln, tired old Lincoln, who needed her help more than he realized. She remembered twenty other reasons—twenty other students. And one last reason: she was also teaching for herself, challenging herself to see if she really could keep up with twenty-two pre adolescents at once, and really accomplish something worthwhile with them. She was teaching so she could keep on growing as a person, keep on connecting with others, keep on learning new ideas. That’s why she was teaching.''

Why be a teacher? The short answer is easy:

:* to witness diversity of growth in young people, and their joy in learning
:* to encourage lifelong learning—both for yourself and for others
:* to experience the challenge of designing and implementing interesting, exciting activities for the young
:* to aggravate the sense of attaining knowledge so that it can restored in the mind and propagated when required as in Hindu  vedic way of teaching srutis and smritis.  
There is, of course, more than this to be said about the value of teaching. Consider, for instance, the “young people” that I just referred to. They could be only six years old, or they could be sixteen, or even adults. They could be rich, poor, or somewhere in between. They could come from families who are Caucasian, Hispanic, African-American, or something else. Their first language could be English—or something else. There are all sorts of possibilities. Whoever your particular students are, they will share potential as human beings: talents and personal qualities—possibly not yet realized—that can contribute to society, whether as leaders, experts, or supporters of others. Your job—I am tempted to say your privilege—will be to help your particular “young people” to realize their potential.

:''Nathan paused for a deep breath before speaking to me. “It’s not like I expected it to be,” he said. “I’ve got five kids who speak English as a second language. I didn’t expect that. I’ve got two, maybe three, with reading disabilities, and one of them has a part-time aide. I’ve had to more about using computers than I ever expected—there’re a lot of curriculum materials online now, and the computers help the kids you need more practice or who finish activities early. I’m doing more screening and testing of kids than I expected, and it all takes time away from teaching.''

:''“But it’s not all surprises. I expected to be able to ‘light a fire’ under kids about learning to read. And that has actually happened, at least sometimes with some children!”''

As a teacher, you will be able to do this by laying groundwork for lifelong learning. You will not teach any one student forever, of course, but you will often teach students long enough to communicate an important message: that there is much in life to learn—in fact more than any one teacher, course, or book can provide. The knowledge could concern science, math, or learning to read; and the skills could involve sports, music, or art—or whatever. Whatever your teaching is about, its immensity can be a source of curiosity, wonder and excitement, and a reason to be optimistic about life in general and about your students in particular. Learning, when properly understood, is never-ending, even though it sometimes focuses on short-term, immediate concerns. As a teacher, you will have an advantage not shared by everyone member of society, namely an excuse not only to teach valuable knowledge and skills, but to point students beyond whatever they will be able to learn from you.

:''“OK,” Jennifer Fuller said to me, suddenly getting almost businesslike in her tone. “Here’s my typical day teaching tenth grade: I get up at 6:30, have a quick breakfast, get to school by 7:45 if the traffic’s not bad. Then I check my email—usually there’s at least a little stuff from the principal or some other administrator, maybe one or two from parents concerned because their child is doing poorly in one of my classes, maybe one or two from students—“I’m going to be sick today, Ms. Fuller!”—that sort of thing. Now it’s 8:15 and I have two hours before my first class—this term I teach only biology, and I only teach periods 2, 3, and 5. Maybe I have marking to do before class, or maybe I have to get a lab demonstration ready. Or maybe we all have to troupe down to library for a staff meeting (groan…). Whatever I don’t finish in the morning, though, I have to finish after school. But that’s also when I meet with the Ecology Club (I’m the faculty advisor), so I might have to finish stuff in the evening. I try not to do it then, but a lot of times I have to. Whatever happens, though, I always quit by 9:00—that’s always when I watch TV for an hour, or just ‘vegetate out’ with a book.”''
        
Whatever you teach, you will be able to feel the satisfaction of designing and orchestrating complex activities, ones that communicate new ideas and skills effectively. The challenge of designing and orchestrating is attractive to many teachers, because it is where they exercise judgment and “artistry” the most freely and frequently. Your students will depend on your skill in these areas, though sometimes without realizing how much they do depend on it. They will need you to know how to explain ideas clearly, to present new materials in a sensible sequence and at an appropriate pace, to point out connections between their new learning and their prior experiences. Although these really take a lifetime to master, they can be practiced successfully even by beginning teachers, and they do improve steadily with continued teaching over time. Right from the start, skill at design and communication of curriculum is one of the major “perks” of the job.

The very complexity of classroom life virtually guarantees that teaching never needs to become boring. Something new and exciting is bound to occur just when you least expect it. A student shows an insight that you never expected to see—or fails to show one that you were sure he had. An activity goes better than you expected—or worse, or merely differently than expected. You understand for the first time why a particular student behaves as she does, and begin thinking of how to respond to the student behavior more helpfully in the future. After teaching a particular learning objective several times, you realize that you understand it differently and more deeply than the first time you taught it. And so on. The job never stays the same, but evolves continually in new directions. As long as you remain in teaching, you get to have a job with novelty.

As a teacher its very important to understand the stranded,temperament and the mother tongue of the child.As a teacher its very important to have a sense of beingness with the child so that the child should feel free to communicate with the teacher.Its very common that a child has a kind of fear psychosis and they fail to communicate and this leads him towards failure.

==[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|Are There Also Challenges To Teaching?]]==

Here, too, the simple answer is also “yes.” Every joy of teaching has a negative possibility lurking near it. You may try to make a difference in students’ lives, but you may also have trouble reaching a certain individual student. The student simply does not seem to learn much, or never seems motivated, or often seems unfriendly, or whatever. And some problems can be subtle: when you call attention to the wonderful immensity of a field of knowledge, you might accidentally discourage a student without intending to—make her feel incapable of learning “enough.” The complexity of designing and implementing instruction can become overwhelming, instead of satisfying. Exciting, unexpected events in your classroom can become chaos rather than attractive novelty. To paraphrase a popular self-help book, sometimes “bad things happen to good teachers.” &lt;ref&gt;Kushner, H. (1983). ''When bad things happen to good people.'' New York: Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; But as in the rest of life, the “bad things” of teaching do not negate the value of the good. If anything, the undesired events make the good, desired ones even more valuable and satisfying, and render your work as a teacher all the more important. As you will see as from reading this book, there are supports and strategies for maximizing the good, valuable, and satisfying when teaching. You can bring these resources to your work, along with your growing professional knowledge and a healthy dose of common sense. In this sense you will not need to “go it alone” in learning to teach well. You will, however, be personally responsible for becoming and remaining the best teacher that you can possibly be; the only person who can make that happen will be you. Some of the resources for making this happen, and in all likelihood that you will welcome, are described in this book in the chapters ahead.
:''&lt;u&gt;Before You Read Further&lt;/u&gt;: If you expect to become a teacher, decide what you think are the most important ideas or skills needed for this work. Go beyond obvious generalities (like “A teacher should know the curriculum and the students”). Focus on the kind of teaching that you personally hope to do, and be as specific as possible (like “A first-grade teacher should know several ways to introduce reading”). Look at your list of needed ideas and skills and ask yourself, “How, if at all, is this list different from what it might have been a generation—or even two generations—ago?”''

==[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|Teaching Is Different From in the Past]]==

In the past two decades teaching has changed significantly, so much in fact that schools are not what some of us may remember from our own childhoods. The changes have affected both the opportunities and the challenges of teaching, as well as the attitudes, knowledge and skills that it takes to prepare for a teaching career. The changes are so important that they have influenced much of the content and discussions in this book, and even its title, Contemporary Educational Psychology.

To see what I mean, look with me briefly at four new trends in education, at how the trends have changed what teachers do, and at how you will therefore need to prepare yourself to teach. The first trend is toward diversity: students today are more diverse in many ways. The diversity has made teaching more fulfilling as a career, but also made instructional planning more challenging in certain respects. The second trend is toward instructional technology: classrooms, schools, and students use computers today than in the past for research, writing, communicating, and keeping records. The use of technology has created new ways for students to learn, but in the process has altered how teachers can teach most effectively, and even raised issues about what constitutes “true” teaching and learning. The third trend is toward accountability in education: both the public and educators themselves are paying much more attention than in the past to how to assess (or provide evidence for) learning and good quality teaching. The attention has increased the importance of education to the public (a good thing) and also improved educational choices for some students. But it also may be creating new constraints on  what teachers teach and on what students learn. The fourth trend is toward increased the professionalism of teachers. Now more than ever, teachers are in positions to assess the quality of their own work as well as that of colleagues, and to take steps to improve it when or if it is necessary. This change gives teachers more opportunity to use their professional expertise, but it also creates higher standards of commitment and of practice and therefore greater worries about teaching “well enough.”

How have these changes—as broad as they are—show up in the daily life of classrooms? For the answer to this question, look at the trends again in more detail.


===[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|New Trend #1: Diversity in Students]]===

Students have, of course, always been diverse in the sense that each student learns at his or her special pace and special way, each has a one-of-a-kind personality, and each shows a unique pattern of motives to learn....[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You/Teaching Is Different From in the Past/Diversity in Students|(read more...)]]

===[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|New Trend #2: Using Technology To Support Learning]]===

For most teachers and classrooms, &quot;technology&quot; means using computers and the Internet as resources for teaching and learning. In principle, these tools have greatly increased the amount and range of information available...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You/Teaching Is Different From in the Past/Technology to Support Learning|(read more...)]]

===[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|New Trend #3: Accountability in Education]]===

In recent years, the general public and public leaders have begun expecting schools, teachers, and students to be more accountable for their work, meaning that schools and teachers are held responsible for their educational activities, and that students are held responsible for learning particular amounts or types of knowledge. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You/Accountability in Education|(read more...)]]

===[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|New Trend #4: Increased Professionalism of Teachers]]===

Whether you consider the first three educational trends worrisome, exicitng, or a mixture of the two, they have all contributed to a fourth trend in education, the increase in ''professionalism'' of teachers.... [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You/Professionalism of Teachers|(read more...)]]

==How Educational Psychology Can Help==

All things considered, then, times have changed for teachers. But teaching itself remains an attractive, satisfying, and worthwhile profession. The trends just described mean simply that you need to prepare for teaching somewhat differently than in the past, and perhaps differently than your own teachers did a generation ago. Fortunately, there are ways to do this. Many current programs in teacher education provide a better balance of experiences for future teachers than in the past; they offer more time to practice teach in the schools, for example, and often instructors make concerted efforts to connect concepts and ideas from education and psychology to actual, useful practices when teaching. These and other features of contemporary teacher education make it easier for you to become the kind of teacher that you will not only want to be, but also need to be.

This book—about educational psychology and its relation to teaching and learning—can be one of these supportive features as you get started. To make it as useful as possible, the text makes continual reference to the demands of teaching and to current trends and changes in the teaching profession. A lot of those reference are framed around the daily problems and challenges—and satisfactions—faced by teachers, and especially by teachers who are relatively new at teaching. Topics are emphasized roughly in proportion to two factors: 1) their importance as reported by teachers and other educational experts, and 2) the ability of educational psychology to comment on particular problems, challenges, and satisfactions helpfully. 

The result is a book that is not just about the research happening in educational psychology, and that is organized a bit differently than many others in this field. Instead of making theories the centerpiece of the book, the focus is often teachers’ and learners’ roles, tasks and activities. Discussion of the theories is framed so as to contribute to understanding these roles, tasks, and activities. Wherever possible and appropriate, too, the research is related to the current trends in education discussed earlier in this chapter--either to support those trends or to oppose them or (sometimes) both at once. As it happens, educational psychology contributes strongly and concretely to understanding teaching, learning, and the changing educational landscape in which teachers do their work. As you read the chapters and sections of this book, you will (hopefully) see why.

If you want a preview of what is in each of the chapters, see also the detailed table of contents for individual chapters; they can be found by going first to the general [[Contemporary Educational Psychology#Table of Contents|Table of Contents]] and clicking on individual chapter titles. If you want a relatively brief explanation of what educational psychology &quot;is&quot; without a lot of attention to its applications to teaching ''per se,'' try the Wikipedia article [[Wikipedia:Educational Psychology]].)

==''Chapter Summary:'' The Changing Teaching Profession and You==

Teaching certainly offers a number of satisfactions; namely, witnessing and assisting the growth of young people, lifelong learning, the challenge and excitement of designing effective instruction. Four educational trends have affected the way that these satisfactions are experienced by classroom teachers: 
# increased diversity of students,
# the spread of instructional technology in schools and classrooms,
# increased expectations for accountability in education, and 
# the development of increased professionalism among teachers.
Each trend presents new opportunities to students and teachers, but also raises new issues for teachers to deal with.

Educational psychology, and this textbook, can help teachers to make constructive use of the new trends as well as deal with the dilemmas that accompany them. It offers information, advice, and useful perspectives specifically in three areas of teaching:
# students as learners,
# instruction and assessment, and 
# the psychological and social awareness of teachers.

==Internet Resources for Chapter 1==
[[http://www.ets.org/praxis Educational Testing Service]]
:Try this website if you are curious to learn more about licensing examinations for teachers, including the PRAXIS II test about &quot;Principles of Learning and Teaching&quot; (PLT) discussed in this chapter. As you will see, specific testing requirements vary somewhat by state, but usually amount to an examination about subject matter knowledge, and often one about principles of teaching and learning as well.

[[http://portal.unesco.org/education/en Education branch of UNESCO]] 
:UNESCO is the abbreviation for the “United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.” This organization has extensive information and news about all forms of diversity in education, viewed from an international perspective. The challenges of teaching diverse classrooms, it seems, are not restricted to the United States, though as the new items on the website show, the challenges take different forms in different countries.

[[http://www.edchange.org EdChange Associates]] 
[[http://www.cec.sped.org Council for Exceptional Children]]
:These two websites have numerous resources about diversity for teachers from a North American (USA and Canada) perspective. They are both useful for planning instruction. The first one—maintained by a group of educators and calling itself EdChange—focuses on culturally related forms of diversity, and the second one—by the Council for Exceptional Children—focuses on children with special educational needs.

Mission Statement: The purpose of this section is to show a programmer how to make sense of the blender game engine source code. It is not intended for those who cannot code in C++. If you're one of the people who have a basic understanding, I'm being careful to use keywords that if you google, should provide enough information to understand.



When you press P, several things are sent to the GE before anything can be done. What might these be?

&lt;pre&gt;StartKetsjiShell(struct ScrArea *area,
		      char* scenename,
		      struct Main* maggie1,
		      struct SpaceIpo *sipo,
		      int always_use_expand_framing)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;


Blender uses a lot of structs and classes. You need to have a working understanding of these as well as inheritance before we can move on. For a refresher: http://www-numi.fnal.gov/offline_software/srt_public_context/WebDocs/Companion/cxx_crib/inheritance.html

'''The SCA_IObject class'''
{{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/gameengine/GameLogic/SCA_IObject.cpp}} and {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/gameengine/GameLogic/SCA_IObject.h|SCA_IObject.h}}

This class encapsulates a lot of other things, so we can start here and move downwards to the things that it controls. First off it uses vectors to store all the different Sensors, Controllers and Actuators that are linked to the object. ''A vector is like an array, but it is dynamic and has built in functions.''&lt;br /&gt;We will begin by examining how sensors are added.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;typedef std::vector&lt;SCA_ISensor *&gt;       SCA_SensorList;&lt;br /&gt;
SCA_SensorList         m_sensors;&lt;/code&gt;

The first line here is a typedef so it just tells us that we can create a vector of SCA_ISensor by using the name SCA_Sensor list.&lt;br /&gt;
The second line creates the vector with the name, m_sensors



&lt;font style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
void SCA_IObject::AddSensor(SCA_ISensor* act)&lt;br /&gt;
{   m_sensors.push_back(act);   }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

This function allows the parents of an SCA_IObject to add new sensors by calling: SCA_IObject.AddSensor(keyboard); ''pseudocode''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So now you know how Objects in the GE create sensors (and actuators and controllers, its the same :) So lets look at how Sensors are grabbed! Since they are dynamically added the program can't make assumptions about how many are there or what they will be. Thus there is this helper function:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
1''SCA_ISensor* SCA_IObject::FindSensor(const STR_String&amp; sensorname)
2{
3	SCA_ISensor* foundsensor = NULL;
4
5	for (SCA_SensorList::iterator its = m_sensors.begin();!(its==m_sensors.end());its++)
6	{
7		if ((*its)-&gt;GetName() == sensorname)
8		{&lt;br /&gt;
9			foundsensor = (*its);
10			break;
11		}
12	}
13	return foundsensor;
14}''
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
Put simply, you give this the name of a sensor and it returns a pointer to the sensor.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
for the newbies:
I know you learned all about classes when i asked you to, but just in case:)
the first word, &quot;SCA_ISensor*&quot; this tells us that the function will return a pointer to a SCA_ISensor. And based on the functions arguments, we know that when you call FindSensor you must give it a string between the parenthesis.
&lt;br /&gt;
in line 3 you create an empty pointer which you will use to store the sensor that you find. Then you loop and go through each sensor in the vector of sensors (remember, it was named m_sensors) until you find the one that matches the name. If you don't find one, you return NULL.



'''void SCA_IObject::Suspend(void)'''
What this does is it loops through all of the sensors and sends each one a &quot;suspend&quot; call. What this does is change a variable named, &quot;m_suspended&quot; which makes stops the sensors from running when they are called with their Activate() function.

'''Shortbread''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookie]] which is traditionally made from one part [[Cookbook:Sugar|white sugar]], two parts [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], and three parts [[Cookbook:Flour|plain white flour]], although other ingredients like [[Cookbook:Rice flour|ground rice]] or [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] are sometimes added to alter the texture.  Shortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word short).  The cause of this texture is its high [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] content, provided by the butter.  The related word &quot;[[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]&quot; refers to any fat that may be added to produce a short (crumbly) texture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shortening|accessdate=2007-01-25|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
* 3 cups (384 g) all-purpose flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup (225 g) butter
* 1/2 cup (115 g) sugar

==Procedure==
#Cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy.
#Sift the flour and salt into  the mixture and work into the fat and sugar until completely amalgamated.
#Shape the dough into a ball and roll out to about ½ inch thick.
#Cut into squares or rectangles and prick the tops with a fork in two parallel lines.
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|275ºF/135ºC]] for 30 to 40 minutes or until the shortbread is lightly browned.
#Leave them on a cake rack to cool.
#Store in a cool place in an airtight container.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have seen that electrons can be observed to act like waves by diffracting through narrow slits. This page will deal with the derivation of the electron's properties from the value of the wavelength. We will consider a situation where electrons of a known energy from an electron gun are diffracted through a grating, and the wavelength deduced as [[Materials_in_Electronics/Wave-Particle_Duality/The_Two-Slit_Experiment/Electrons|before]].

Although this page deals only with results obtained through experimental methods, the same results can be obtained from relativity, but the derivation is beyond the scope of this book. A diagram of the set-up is shown below. Note that the scale is very much exaggerated - the crystal spacing is minute compared to the distance to the screen.

[[Image:Electron diffraction setup.svg|center]]

By varying the voltage, ''V'', of the electron gun, we find, empirically, that:

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}&lt;/math&gt;

We also know the following relation about the velocity, ''v'', of electrons produced by electron guns:

::&lt;math&gt;v=\sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:*''e'' is the charge on an electron
:*''m'' is the mass of an electron

Therefore, velocity is proportial to the square root of the voltage:

::&lt;math&gt;v \propto \sqrt{V}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda \propto \frac{1}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mass is constant (neglecting relativity), we can bring it out of the constant of proportionality and say that

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda \propto \frac{1}{mv}&lt;/math&gt;

We call the remaining constant of proportionality '''Planck's Constant''', or ''h'':
{{eqn|de Broglie's Relationship}}
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}=\frac h p&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is momentum. Plank's Constant is very useful, and it turns up in all aspects of quantum physics and therefore also in electronics.

Sometimes it is convenient to use the wavenumber, rather than the wavelength:

::&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{h}{2 \pi}k&lt;/math&gt;

We also sometime use ''ħ'', which is called the '''Reduced Planck's Constant''' or '''Dirac's Constant''' and is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\hbar = \frac{h}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore get:

::&lt;math&gt;p = \hbar k&lt;/math&gt;

The values for ''h'' and ''ħ'' are:
:*&lt;math&gt;h     = 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mbox{ J s}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\hbar = 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \mbox{ J s}&lt;/math&gt;

|}


==Uncertainty==

In fact, if we were to slow the electron beam down until only one electron was fired at a time, the diffraction fringes still build up, one dot at a time, implying that the solitary electron diffracts through ''both'' slits and interferes with itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===New Trend #1: Diversity in Students===

Students have, of course, always been diverse in the sense that each student learns at his or her special pace and special way, each has a one-of-a-kind personality, and each shows a unique pattern of motives to learn. In recent decades, though, the forms of diversity have become more numerous, and consequently also the extent of diversity. More than ever, classrooms now serve students who come from diverse language backgrounds, who have more special educational needs, and who are more diverse in age.

'''Language Diversity''' Across the United States, for example, about 40 million people, or 14% of the population are Hispanic. About 20% of these speak primarily Spanish, and approximately another 50% speak only limited English.  The educators responsible for the children among these 30 million people need to accommodate instruction to these students somehow. They can do so partly, of course, by arranging for specialized second-language teachers and classes. But some of the adjustment also must happen in “regular” classrooms over a wide range of grade levels and subject areas: classroom teachers must learn to communicate, that is, with students whose English language background is limited, at the same time that the students themselves are learning to use English more fluently. &lt;ref&gt;Pitt, K. (2005). ''Debates on ESL teaching and learning: Culture, communities, and classrooms.'' London, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Since relatively few teachers are themselves Hispanic or speak fluent Spanish, the adjustments can sometimes be a challenge. Teachers must plan and carry out lessons in ways that students actually understand, and about which students can communicate their thoughts and needs. At the same time teachers must still keep track of the major learning goals of the curriculum. In Chapter 4 (“Student Diversity”) and Chapter 11 (“Instructional Planning”), I describe some ways of doing this. As you gain experience teaching, you will no doubt find additional strategies and resources &lt;ref&gt; Gebhard, L. (2006), ''Teaching english as a second or foreign language: A teacher self-development and methodology guide, 2nd edition.'' Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press. &lt;/ref&gt;, especially if second-language learners become an important part of your classes.

'''Diversity of Special Educational Needs''' Language is not the only way that students increasingly differ. Another new source of difference has been the inclusion of students with disabilities into classrooms with non-disabled peers. In the United States the trend actually began in the 1970s but accelerated with the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, and amended again most recently in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;United States Government Printing Office. (2005). (ref still needed) &lt;/ref&gt; In general this law guarantees free, appropriate education for children with disabilities of any kind—whether the impairment is physical, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral. The law recognizes that such students also need supports in order to learn or function effectively in a classroom with non-disabled peers, so it also supports the provision of special services (for example, special teaching assistants) and individualized educational plans to help the students be as successful as possible.

As a result of these changes, you are highly likely to have at least a few students with special educational needs in your classes, even if you never become a special education teacher and even if you have not had any personal experience with people with disabilities. You are also likely to work as part of a professional team focused on helping these students to learn as well as possible and to participate in the life of the school. For teachers, this turn of events is definitely new compared to circumstances just two generations ago, or even one generation ago. It raises new challenges about planning instruction (like “In practice, how do I find time to plan for individuals?”), and philosophical questions about the very nature of education, such as “What does it mean to say that a student has truly ‘learned’ something?” and “What in the curriculum is truly important to learn?” These questions will come up again in Chapter 5, where I discuss teaching students with special educational needs.

'''Lifelong Learning''' But the increases in diversity are not limited even to language or disabilities. Another recent change has been the broadening of the age range of individuals who count as “students.” Since 2000, half or more of all three- and four-year-olds have attended some form of educational program, either part-time preschool or full-time child care &lt;ref&gt; National Institute for Early Education Research. (2006). [[http://www.nieer.org/resources/facts ''Percent of population age 3 and 4 who are enrolled in school.'']] Retrieved March 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some public school divisions have moved toward including nursery or preschool programs as a newer “grade level” preceding kindergarten. Others have expanded the hours of kindergarten (itself considered a “new” program early in the 20th century) to a full-day program.

The obvious differences in maturity between preschoolers and older children lead the teachers of the very young to relatively flexible, open-ended forms of planning, and to relatively personal or family-like relationships with their young “students” than is typical of teachers of older students&lt;ref&gt; Bredekamp, S. &amp; Copple, C. (1997). ''Developmentally appropriate practice, Revised edition.'' Washington, D.C.: National Association for the Education of Young Children.&lt;/ref&gt;. Just as important, though, may be the educational and philosophical debates that the growth of early childhood education has stimulated in the public and among all teachers. Some ask whether preschool and day care programs risk becoming inappropriate substitutes for families. Others suggest, in contrast, that teachers of older students can learn from the flexibility and open-ended approach common in early childhood education. For teachers, it is a debate that cannot be avoided completely or permanently, no matter what the grade-level or age of their students. In this book, it reappears in Chapter 3, where I discuss students’ development—their major long-term, changes in skills, knowledge, and attitudes.

But the other end of the age spectrum has also expanded. Even if they do not attend university, many individuals take courses well into adulthood. Adult education, as it is often called, often takes place in workplaces, but it often also happens in public high schools or at a local community college or university. Some adult students may be completing high school credentials that they missed earlier in their lives, but often the students have other purposes that are even more focused, such as learning a trade-related skill. The teachers of adult students have to adjust their instructional strategies and relationships with students both to challenge and to respect the special strengths and constraints of students who are adults&lt;ref&gt; Bash, L. (Ed.). (2005). ''Best practices in adult learning.'' Boston: Anker Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;. The students’ maturity often means, for example, that they have had life experiences that enhance and motivate the learning of new skills and knowledge. But by the same token they may have legitimate personal responsibilities—such as parenting or a full-time job—which compete for study time, and that leave adult students less tolerant of teaching that they consider irrelevant to their personal goals or needs. These advantages and constraints highlight similar issues that also occur to a lesser extent among “regular” high school students, who sometimes have legitimate family or job responsibilities as well. In this way the increases in adult education have affected secondary teachers even when the teachers do not work with adults directly. How can teachers make sure that instruction does not waste students’ time? Or stated more positively, how can they make instruction truly efficient, effective, and perceived as truly valuable? Later in this book (especially in Part 2, about assessment and instruction), I will discuss this question from a number of perspectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===New Trend #2: Using Technology to Support Learning===

For most teachers and classrooms, “technology” means using computers and the Internet as resources for teaching and learning. In principle, these tools have greatly increased the amount and range of information available to students (Cuban, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Cuban, L. (2001).  ''Oversold and underused: Computers in the classroom.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. With the Internet, it is now relatively easy to access up-to-date information on practically any subject imaginable, often with pictures, video clips, and audio to accompany them. On the face of it, therefore, the Internet and its associated technologies have the potential to transform (some would even say “revolutionize”) traditional school-based learning.

For a variety of reasons, however, technology has not always been integrated into teachers’ practices thoroughly (Haertel &amp; Means, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Haertel, G. &amp; Means, B. (2003). ''Evaluating educational technology: Effective research designs for improving learning.'' New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. One reason is practical: many classrooms still contain only one or two computers, and many schools still have only limited access to the Internet. If students have to wait for a turn on the computer or arrange to visit the computer lab or school library, they may limit how much they use the Internet, no matter how much they or their teachers believe in using computers in principle. In such cases, furthermore, computers tend to function in relatively traditional or familiar ways: as a word processor (or “fancy typewriter”), for example, or as a library reference book similar to an encyclopedia, which also requires special effort to use.

Even so, though, one-computer classrooms create new possibilities (and challenges) for teachers. A single computer can be set up, for example, to present new assignments or supplementary material to students, either one at a time or small groups. In serving this function the computer gives a teacher a bit more leeway about when students are allowed to finish old tasks or to begin new ones. A single computer can also enrich the learning of individual students who are especially motivated. And it can provide extra or remedial review for students who need help with particular concepts, knowledge of skills. These changes are not dramatic, but they point toward an important change that technology makes possible in teachers’ traditional role: from being the single source for delivering information to students, to being a facilitator for students’ own constructions of knowledge.

The shift from “full-frontal teaching” to “guide on the side” becomes much more possible as the amount and use of computer and Internet technologies increases. If a school (or better yet, a classroom) has numerous computers with full Internet access, then students’ can self-direct their own learning much more freely, at least in principle, than if computers and the Internet are scarce commodities. With ample technology, teachers can focus much more on helping individuals in developing and carrying out learning plans, and on assisting individuals who encounter special misunderstandings or who need special help in using computers or the Internet as tools. In this way a strong shift to computers and the Internet can change a teacher’s role significantly, and make the teacher (and students, too) more effective and “efficient” about learning.

But there are limits and costs that come with the change toward technology, and some of these also affect a teacher’s role. The most literal of the costs is the money needed to equip a classroom or school fully: often that money is simply not available, or comes by depriving other valued educational initiatives, like hiring additional staff or buying needed books and supplies. But other limits and costs also occur that are less tangible and more subtle. In using the Internet, for example, students need help in sorting out good, trustworthy information or websites from the “fluff”—the unreliable or even damaging websites (Seiter, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Seiter, E. (2005). The INTERNET playground: Children’s access, entertainment, and miseducation. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;. Sometimes the sorting can be difficult even for experienced teachers. And some educational goals simply do not lend themselves to computerized learning—including any performance-oriented activities, such as sports, driver education, or choral practice. Still other activities by definition require face-to-face interaction among individuals—notably drama, or the resolution of a conflict between two students who get in an argument. As a new teacher, therefore, you will need not only to sort out what technologies are possible in your particular classroom, but also what in principle might or might not be assisted by the new technologies. Then be prepared for your decisions to affect how you teach—your role—at least to some extent.

==11-19==
Once you learn all the numbers from 1 to 10, afterwards it gets much easier. In the case of 11 to 19, just add a number from 1 to 9 after ''on'' to make '''on bir''', '''on iki''', etc. (11 and 12 respectively).

==20-99==
The same thing applies here. Just add the name of a unit after the name of a ten. For example, to make the number 36, just take the words ''otuz'' and ''altı'' to make '''otuz altı''' (36). As long as you know your numbers from 1 to 10, all you really need to learn here are the names of the tens.

|}

==100-999==
This also works the same way. Now that you know your tens and units, hundreds are extremely easy. ''Yüz'' is 100. To say 300 in Azerbaijani, all you do is put ''üç'' (3) before ''yüz'', leaving you with '''üç yüz''' (300).

|}

==1000+==
Thousands, millions and more work in exactly the same ways. After millions, all values have the same names as their English equivalents, although spelt differently (e.g. trillion = ''trilyon'' in English and Azerbaijani respectively). However, don't feel frightened by this, because the spellings aren't unique (i.e. they all end in ''-yon'').

The only problem you may face among the words below is with the Azerbaijani terms for ''billion''. Although ''bilyon'' can be used, the term ''milyard'' tends to be much more common.

      <comment>/* Small font size in other chapters. */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page has some problems with the links. I thought that I knew how to handle the syntax and logic of the links, but obviously I was not completely correct with some of them. I will get back at fixing them ASAP, but anyone else is welcome to do so if I don't get to it right away.

(Sections of a chapter in a Wikibook are somewhat more &quot;heirarchical&quot; than in a print-version chapter--though possibly some of you may disagree.)

[[User:Klseifert|Klseifert]] 20:19, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

To-Do List for this chapter-page and its subpages:
1. Add citations (mainly to the subpages re the four &quot;New Trends&quot;
2. Add cross-links from each &quot;New Trend&quot; to the others, and possibly also back to the main page.
3. Figure out how, if at all, to use the rest of the End Matter. Probably this will be straightforward, but it needs a bit of thought.

To-Do more generally:
1. Add T of Contents for rest of the chapters--a priority!
2. Think of appropriate cross-links to other Wikibooks or Wikipedia articles (but be sparing).

Cheers!

==Print size too small when Chapter 1 printed out==
When I print this chapter, the font size is rather small on my printer (about 8-point). Is that happening on everyone's printer, or just mine? Is there any way within the Wiki to enlarge the print to about 12-point? I can do it manually each time by specifying a larger font on my printer, but this is a nuisance and some readers might not figure out how to do this.

Any suggestions?[[User:130.179.184.28|130.179.184.28]] 13:40, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

p.s. Sorry--the above note was from me. I forgot to sign in.[[User:Klseifert|Klseifert]] 13:42, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

== Experiment: Does Length of Wiki page affect size of font when printed? ==

In a word, &quot;no&quot;--length of page seems to make no difference in font size. As an experiment, I deleted about 2/3s of Chapter 1 temporarily, and printed the shortened version. Result: print size was the same as before. I then restored the earlier, complete version of the chapter.

Some pages seem to print with &quot;tiny&quot; font, but others have larger (12-point) font. I suppose there is some subtle feature about how I have my own printer configured, but I haven't figured it out yet.

I will now try printing a sample of other chapters to see if the problem is widespread (at least for me).

[[User:Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]] 20:39, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

== Small font size in other chapters. ==

I sampled Chapter 2 and Chapter 12. Result: Chapter 2 was smallish (about 8-10 point) and Chapter 12 was very small (maybe 6-8 point)--too small to read easily. Chapter 1 was closer to Chapter 12 than to Chapter 2 in size. The opening pages are fine--note that they were the only ones that I typed into the Wiki directly. The others were all copied and pasted from a previous Word document.

Unless I can figure out why this is happening, I can only get a decent-sized printing by copying and pasting the whole works into a word document, &quot;selecting all,&quot; and resizing the font. This defeats part of the purpose of using the Wiki.

I realize that this problem may be unique to me ([[User talk: Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] says it does not happen to him), so my best hope is that others are having better luck at printing than I have had.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Schrödinger's Equation is a [[Ordinary Differential Equations|differential equation]] that describes the evolution of ''&amp;Psi;(x)'' over time. By solving the differential equation for a particular situation, the wave function can be found. It is a statement of the conservation of energy of the particle.

==Schrödinger's Equation in 1-Dimension==

In the simplest case, a particle in one dimension, it is derived as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;T\left( x \right) + V\left( x \right) = E,&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''T(x)'' is the kinetic energy of the particle
*''V(x)'' is the potential energy of the particle
*''E'' is the energy of the particle, which is constant

Substituting for the kinetic energy of wave, as shown [[Materials in Electronics/Wave-Particle Duality/Electrons as Waves|here]]:

::&lt;math&gt;{{\hbar ^2 k^2 } \over {2m}} + V\left( x \right) = E&lt;/math&gt;

Now we need to get this differential equation in terms of ''&amp;Psi;(x)''. Assume that ''&amp;Psi;(x)'' is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\psi \left( x \right) = \psi _0 e^{jkx}&lt;/math&gt;

Double differentiating our trial solution,:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;{{d^2 } \over {dx^2 }}\psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; =  - k^2 \psi _0 e^{jkx} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; =  - k^2 \psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Rearranging for ''k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''

::&lt;math&gt;k^2  =  - {1 \over {\psi \left( x \right)}}{{d^2 } \over {dx^2 }}\psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this in the differential equation gives:

::&lt;math&gt; - {1 \over {\psi \left( x \right)}}{\hbar^2  \over {2m}}{{d^2 } \over {dx^2 }}\psi \left( x \right) + V\left( x \right) = E&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by ''&amp;Psi;(x)'' gives us '''Schrödinger's Equation in 1D''':
{{eqn|Schrödinger's Equation in 1D}}
:{|style=&quot; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|&lt;math&gt; - {\hbar^2  \over {2m}}{{d^2 \psi \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }} + V\left( x \right)\psi \left( x \right) = E\psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{| width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|Solving the Schrödinger Equation gives us the wavefunction of the particle, which can be used to find the electron distribution in a system.
|}

This is a '''time-independent''' solution - it will not change as time goes on. It is straightforward to add time-dependence to this equation, but for the moment we will consider only time-independent wave functions, so it is not necessary. The time-dependent wavefunction is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Psi \left(x,t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

While this equation was derived for a specific function, a complex exponential, it is more general than it appears as [[w:Fourier analysis|Fourier analysis]] can express any continuous function over range ''L'' as a sum of functions of this kind:

::&lt;math&gt;{f}\left( {x} \right) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {c_n e^{ - jkx} ,}  \quad k = {{n \pi } \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Schrödinger Equation as an Eigenequation==

The Schrödinger Equation can be expressed as an '''eigenequation''' of the form:
{{eqn|Schrödinger Equation as an Eigenequation}}
::&lt;math&gt;H \psi = E \psi \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*''&amp;psi;'' is the eigenfunction (or eigenstate, both mean the same thing)
*''E'' is the eigenvalue corresponding to the energy.
*''H'' is the Hamiltonian operator given by:
{{eqn|1D Hamiltonian Operator}}
::&lt;math&gt;H= - {\hbar  \over {2m}}{{d^2} \over {dx^2 }} + V\left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This means that by applying the operator, ''H'', to the function ''&amp;psi;(x)'', we will obtain a solution that is simply a scalar multiple of ''&amp;psi;(x)''. This multiple is ''E'' - the energy of the particle.

:{| width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|This also means that every wavefunction (i.e. every solution to the Schrödinger Equation) has a particular associated energy.
|}

==Higher Dimensions==

The equation that we just derived is the Schrödinger equation for a particle in one dimension. Adding more dimensions is not difficult. The three dimensional equation is:

::&lt;math&gt; - {{\hbar ^2 } \over {2m}}\nabla ^2 \psi \left( {\mathbf{r}} \right) + V\left( {\mathbf{r}} \right)\psi \left( {\mathbf{r}} \right) = E\psi \left( {\mathbf{r}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:Laplace operator|Laplace operator]], which, in [[w:Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian coordinates]], is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2  = {{\partial ^2 } \over {\partial x^2 }} + {{\partial ^2 } \over {\partial y^2 }} + {{\partial ^2 } \over {\partial z^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[/Higher Dimensions|this page]] for the derivation. It is also possible to add more dimensions, but this does not generally yield useful results, given that we inhabit a 3D universe.

==Spin==

In order to integrate Schrödinger's equation with relativity, [[w:Paul Dirac|Paul Dirac]] showed that electrons have an additional property, called '''spin'''. This does not actually mean the electron is spinning on an axis, but in some ways it is a useful analogy.

The spin on an electron can take two values;

::&lt;math&gt; \pm {1 \over 2}\hbar &lt;/math&gt;

We can incorporate spin into the wavefunction, ''&amp;Psi;'' by multiplying by an addition component - the spin wavefunction, ''&amp;sigma;(s)'', where ''s'' is ±1/2. This is often just called &quot;spin-up&quot; and &quot;spin-down&quot;, respectively. The full, time-dependent, wavefunction is now given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\Psi \left( {{\mathbf{r}},t} \right) = \psi \left( {\mathbf{r}} \right)w\left( t \right)\sigma \left( s \right)&lt;/math&gt;


==Conditions on the Wavefunction==

In order to represent a particle's state, the wavefunction must satisfy several conditions:

*It must be square-integrable, and moreover, the integral of the wavefunction's probability density function must be equal to unity, as the electron must exist somewhere in all of space:

::&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\left| {\psi \left( {{\mathbf{r}}} \right)} \right|^2 dx\,dy\,dz} } }=1&lt;/math&gt;

:For 1D systems this is:

::&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\left| {\psi \left( x \right)} \right|^2 dx = 1}&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\psi \left( \mathbf{r} \right)&lt;/math&gt; must be continuous, because its derivative, which in proportional to momentum, must be finite.

*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \psi \left( \mathbf{r} \right)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; must be continuous, because its derivative, which is proportional to kinetic energy, must be finite.

*&lt;math&gt;\psi \left( \mathbf{r} \right)&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy boundary conditions. In particular, as ''x'' tends to infinity, ''&amp;psi;('''r''')'' tends to zero. (This is required to satisfy the normalistation condition above).

==Examples of Use of Schrödinger's Equation==

Schrödinger's Equation can be used to find wavefunctions for many physical systems. See [[Materials in Electronics/Confined Particles|Confined Particles]] for more information.

==Summary==

*Shrödinger's Equation (SE) is a statement of the Law of Conservation of Energy.
*It is given by &lt;math&gt; - {\hbar^2  \over {2m}}{{d^2 \psi \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }} + V\left( x \right)\psi \left( x \right) = E\psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
*By solving the equation, one can obtain the wavefunction, ''&amp;psi;''.
*From the wavefunction we find the distribution of the electron's probability function.
*The probability of the electron existing over all space must be 1.
*SE gives a set of discrete wavefunctions, each with an associated energy.
*An electron cannot exist at an energy other than these.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===New Trend #3: Accountability in Education===

In recent years, the general public and public leaders have begun expecting schools, teachers, and students to be more accountable for their work, meaning that schools and teachers are held responsible for their educational activities, and that students are held responsible for learning particular amounts or types of knowledge. Among other effects, the trend toward accountability has increased the legal requirements for becoming and (sometimes) remaining certified as a teacher. Preservice teachers (which include many of you reading this book) need more subject-area and education-related courses than previously, for example, must often spend more time practice teaching than in the past, and have to pass one or more examinations of their knowledge of subject matter and teaching strategies. The specifics of these requirements vary among the states and school districts, which hold primary jurisdiction over them. But the general trend—toward more numerous and “higher” levels of requirements—has occurred broadly across the United States, and even throughout the English-speaking nations of the world. The changes obviously affect individuals’ experiences of becoming a teacher—including the speed or ease with which they can do so, and sometimes even whether an individual manages to become a teacher at all.

'''High-Stakes Testing''' For students, public expectation of accountability for learning has led to increased use of high-stakes testing. These are tests, often with a structured format such as multiple-choice, given to all students in a school district, region, or particular state or province (Fuhrman &amp; Elmore, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Fuhrman, S. &amp; Elmore, R. (2004). ''Redesigning accountability systems for education.'' New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. High-stakes tests by definition have important consequences for students, such as influencing the final grade they receive, or influencing whether a student is allowed to graduate or to continue on to the next level of schooling. Such testing raises important questions about what teachers should teach, as well as how (and whether) they can help students to pass such examinations. It also raises issues about whether high-stakes testing is in fact fair to all students and therefore consistent with other ideals of public education, such as giving all students the best possible start in life instead of screening out or disqualifying individuals. Furthermore, since the results of high-stakes tests are sometimes also used to evaluate the performance of teachers, schools or school districts, insuring students’ success on them can become an obvious concern for teachers—one that can affect many of their instructional decisions on a daily basis. For this reason I discuss the purpose, nature and effects of high-stakes tests at length in Chapters 10 and 11. Here in Chapter 1, however, it is more important to understand the most prominent source of the general trend toward accountability, the No Child Left Behind Act.

'''The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001''' One of the most visible, recent expressions of the trend toward accountability in the United States is Public Law 107-110, usually called the No Child Left Behind Act (or NCLB) (United States Government Printing Office, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Printing Office. (2002). ''No Child Left Behind Act: A desktop reference.'' Washington, D.C.: Author&lt;/ref&gt;. The law places conditions on states’ receiving money from the Federal government to support students from low-income families—which in practice includes virtually every state in the nation. To receive such funding, NCLB requires that a state do the following:

* The state must create a system for assessing how well schools are performing—for example by giving annual tests of how well low-achieving students are doing, or by keeping records of the graduation rates of low-achieving students. The state must also determine minimum levels of acceptable performance on these measures, which the law calls the adequate yearly progress (or AYP) for the school. The law requires that all schools eventually demonstrate AYP.

* The state must also insure that all of its teachers are “highly qualified,” meaning that they have fulfilled the state’s certification and licensing requirements. For any new teacher, the law also requires possessing at least a bachelor’s degree, as well as taking special licensing exams related to the teacher’s area or level of teaching.

* The state must measure the educational progress of its students every year in language arts and math, and every few years in science. In practice this requirement insures the use of some sort of high-stakes testing in these areas, in the sense described above.

* The state must keep parents informed not only of their child’s educational progress, as schools have done traditionally, but also about whether their child’s school is meeting the standards of adequate yearly progress. In addition, if the child’s teacher does not meet the standard of being “highly qualified” as described above, then the state is required to inform parents of this fact as well.

* Finally, the law requires that schools failing to make adequate yearly progress for any significant time must offer parents the option of sending their child to another school, or of receiving special tutoring or after-school assistance. By law, too, parents must be involved in planning improvements to their child’s school.

For teachers, there is both good news and worrisome news in these provisions (Harris &amp; Herrington, 2006; Borkowski &amp; Sneed, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Harris, D. &amp; Herrington, C. (2006). Accountability, standards, and the growing achievement gap: Lessons from the past half-century. ''American Journal of Education, 112''(2), 163-208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borkowski, J. &amp; Sneed, M. (2006). Will NCLB improve or harm public education? ''Harvard Educational Review, 76''(4), 503-526.&lt;/ref&gt;. The good news is that the law focuses the attention of schools, parents, and political leaders on something teachers have long known: that achievement is very low for certain groups of students, whether because of poverty, students’ disabilities, or racial prejudices. Potentially, therefore, NCLB can stimulate more effort (and funds) to make education a more truly democratic, equalizing influence on society—a goal that many educators support at least in principle. Another benefit is that the NCLB legislation increases parents’ choice about and influence over their child’s education, both by keeping them informed of the quality of education the child is receiving and by involving parents in making plans for improving their child’s school. These changes make parents potential partners of teachers in devising the best education possible for children.

The worrisome news takes two forms. One is that the methods for insuring a school’s AYP may not be valid (Glassford, 2005; Lubienski, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Glassford, L. (2005). Triumph of politics over pedagogy? The case of the Ontario Teacher Qualifying Test. In[[http://www.umanitoba.ca/publications/cjeap/articles/glassford.html ''Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy'', Issue #45.]] Retrieved on August 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lubienski, C. (2005). Public schools in marketized environments: Shifting incentives and unintended consequences of competition-based educational reforms. ''American Journal of Education, 111''(4), 464-486.&lt;/ref&gt;. Critics point out that it is the states, not the Federal government, that set the standards for AYP, so states may have an incentive to set somewhat low standards of AYP so that as many of its schools can receive Federal funding as possible. For teachers (as well as for parents and students), this tendency could translate into continued gaps in achievement for disadvantaged students—continued lack of materials or qualified staff for schools serving high proportions of these students, alongside comparative abundance of materials and staff for the more well-off. 

The testing required by NCLB has been a special focus of concern by some educators (Rudalevige, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Rudalevige, A. (2005, August). Reform or séance? Seeking the “spirit” of the No Child Left Behind. ''Teachers College Record.'' Online at [[http://www.tcrecord.org Teachers College Record Online]], ID# 12112.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some point out that students likely to perform below average—such as those with a specific reading disability or those who speak English as a second language—are required to take yearly testing in language arts, they could lower a school’s overall performance and therefore jeopardize its status as making truly “adequate” yearly progress. Others fear that school districts might be tempted to manipulate the testing process so as to exclude students likely to perform poorly (e.g. students with certain sorts of disabilities) and thereby raise the overall performance of the school. Still other educators remind us that yearly testing could lead many teachers to “teach to the test”—tailoring an undue amount of their teaching not to what students should know in general, but to what they need specifically to pass a particular yearly high-stakes test (Neil, 2003; Volante, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Neil, M. (2003). The dangers of testing. ''Educational Leadership, 60''(5), 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volante, L. (2004). Teaching to the test: What every educator and policy-maker should know. Online at [[http://www.umanitoba.ca/publications/cjeap/articles/volante.html ''Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, Issue #35.'']]&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, curriculum areas not related directly to the yearly testing, such as music, the arts, or physical education, might suffer as funds are diverted from them into activities that relate directly to preparing students for their annual test. These possibilities would affect the daily work of most teachers quite directly, both in terms of what teachers teach as well as how they teach.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===New Trend #4: Increased Professionalism of Teachers===

Whether you consider the first three educational trends worrisome, exciting, or a mixture of the two, they have all contributed to a fourth trend in education, the increase in professionalism of teachers. Partly by definition, an occupation (like medicine or law—or in this case teaching) is a profession if its members take personal responsibility for the quality of their work, if fellow members of the occupation hold each other accountable for the quality as well, and if practicing the occupation is complex and requires special training in order to be practiced.

The trends in education that I described earlier mean that teaching has become more professional than in the past (Cochran-Smith &amp; Fries, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Cochran-Smith, M. &amp; Fries, K. (2005). Research teacher education in changing times: Politics and paradigms. In M. Cochran-Smith &amp; K. Zeichner (Eds.), ''Studying teacher education: The report of the AERA Panel on Research and Teacher Education, 69-110.''&lt;/ref&gt;. Because of increased expectations for achievement for all students, teachers must take increased responsibility not only for their students’ success at learning, but also for their own development as teachers. To become a new teacher, furthermore, now requires more specialized work than in the past, as reflected in states’ evolving requirements for certification and licensing in general, as well as by the NCLB requirement of “highly qualified” teachers in every school. And though teaching has always been challenging, its complexity has increased because of the recent trends toward greater diversity of students and toward the use of technology in classrooms.

Greater professionalism has emerged not only from external influences like the Federal NCLB legislation, but also from initiatives by educators themselves. For example, many teachers and educational leaders increasingly understand and support the value of action research (sometimes also called teacher research), which are studies by teachers of their own students or their own work. Action research studies lead to concrete decisions that improve a teacher’s own teaching or the teaching of colleagues (Mertler, 2006; Stringer, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Mertler, C. (2006). ''Action research: Teachers as researchers in the classroom.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stringer, E. (2004). ''Action research in education. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education.''&lt;/ref&gt;. Such studies can take many forms, but here are a few brief examples:

* How precisely do individual children learn to read? In an action research study, the teacher might observe and track one child’s reading progress carefully for an extended time. From the observations she can get clues about how to help not only that particular child to read better, but also other children in her class or even in colleagues’ classes.

* Does it really matter if a high school social studies teacher uses more, rather than fewer, open-ended questions? As an action research study, the teacher might videotape his own lessons,  and systematically compare students’ responses to his open-ended questions compared to their responses to more closed questions (the ones with more fixed answers). The analysis might suggest when and how much it is indeed desirable to use open-ended questions.

* Can an art teacher actually entice students to take more creative risks with their drawings? As an action research study, the teacher might examine the students’ drawings carefully for signs of visual novelty and innovation, and then see if the signs increase if she encourages novelty and innovation explicitly.

Two other, more complete examples of action research are summarized in [[/Table 1/]] (and the topic is also discussed in more detail in [[../../Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessments of Learning/]]). Although these examples, like many action research studies, resemble “ordinary good teaching practice,” they are planned more thoughtfully than usual, carried out and recorded more systematically, and shared with fellow teachers more thoroughly and openly. As such, they yield special benefits to teachers as professionals, though they also take special time and effort—a problem to which I return in Chapter 10, where I discuss assessment of students’ learning in detail. For now, the important point is that use of action research simultaneously reflects the increasing professionalism of teachers, and at the same time points toward new, evolving challenges of teaching.

:'''''Before You Read Further:''' If you expect to be a teacher (and perhaps even if you do not), ask yourself what you already believe that psychology is about, and therefore what you expect that educational psychology may be about. Make a brief list, either mentally or in writing, of a few of its major features—including ones that you believe may not be especially useful to teachers. Then read the next section while looking at your list from time to time.''

===Steps in Action Research Project===
:''Example 1:'' Students’ Use of the Internet
:''Example 2:'' A Teacher’s Helpfulness to ESL Students

===Purpose of the Research (as expressed by the teacher doing the research)===
:For ''Example 1:'' “In doing assignments, how successful are my students at finding high-quality, relevant information?”
: For ''Example 2:'' “Am I responding to my ESL students as fully and helpfully as to my English-speaking students, and why or why not?”

===Who Is Doing the Study?===
:For ''Example 1:'' Classroom teacher (elementary level) and school computer specialist teacher
:For ''Example 2:'' Classroom teacher (senior high level)—studying self; possibly collaborating with other teachers or with ESL specialist.

===How Information Is Gathered and Recorded===
:For ''Example 1:'' by assessing students’ assignments; by observing students while they search the Internet; by interviewing students about their search experiences
:For ''Example 2:'' by videotaping of self interacting during class discussions; by keeping a journal diary by teacher of experiences with ESL vs. other students; by interviewing students of the ESL teacher

===How Information Is Analyzed===
:For ''Example 1:'' Look for obstacles and “search tips” expressed by several students; look for common strengths and problems with research cited on assignments
:For ''Example 2:'' Look for differences in type and amount of interactions with ESL vs. other students; look for patterns in the differences; by altering the patterns of interaction and observe the result

===How Information is Reported and Communicated===
:For ''Example 1:'' Write brief report of results for fellow staff; give brief oral report to fellow staff about results
:For ''Example 2:'' Write a summary of the results in teacher’s journal diary; share results with fellow staff; share results with teacher’s students

'''Rice flour''' is made from white rice and has a fine, powdery texture.  '''Brown rice flour''' is also produced.  Rice flour is used in baked goods and in many national and regional cuisines.  In Middle-Eastern cuisine, it is used in the dessert ''mihallabiyya''. In Latin-American cuisine, it is used to thicken the drink ''horchata''. '''Glutinous Rice Flour''' is used a great deal in Asian cuisine. It is also known as ''sweet rice flour'', ''sticky rice flour'', and ''waxy rice flour''.  Standard rice flour cannot be used as a substitute in a recipe calling for glutinous rice flour.</text>

'''Bean and Green Chili Soup''' - An easy, surprising soup from easily stored ingredients

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (480 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]]) [[Cookbook:rice|cooked rice]]
*1 can (16 oz, 450 g) refried beans
*1 can (16 oz, 450 g) black beans
*1 small can (4 oz, 110 g) green salsa
*1 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (300 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]]) dried, bulk black bean soup mix
*(optional) sour cream

==Procedure==
# Bring 1 cup (240 ml) dry rice and 2 cups (480 ml) water to a boil
# Turn heat to low and steam rice for 25-30 min (or prepare rice using rice cooker)
# Prepare soup mix by combining with 3 cups (720 ml) boiling water, simmer about 5 min
# Add remaining ingredients and rice to soup
# Heat through, stirring occasionally
# (optional) just before serving, spoon a teaspoon of sour cream in to the middle of the bowl

==Notes, tips, and variations==
This recipe is surprisingly flavorful for being prepared form preserved ingredients.  With a dollop of sour cream for garnish, it is even better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Starting a new &amp; I hope useful book, I'm just kicking things off right now; the amount of time I have for this project is kind of limited.  I'll try &amp; get an outline &amp; suggested style &amp; etc together for people to work on;  think something like  ubuntu for dummies, only more comprehensive &amp; with a graduated system of depth in each subject, say:   beginner, intermediate, expert.  I'd like to try &amp; keep the writing &amp; overall style accessible to the average reader, tho with some leeway, especially in the  expert level.  I'd also like to try keep it fun;  friendly, helpful,  with some room for humour. helpful suggestions &amp; contributions &amp; etc. are most welcome!  :)

Hi; welcome aboard &amp; thanks for your contributions so far!  I fixed the image link; i'm not sure what was wrong but wikibooks didnt seem to want to connect with wikipedia, so i just saved a copy of the pic &amp; uploaded it from my comp; there's a bunch more ubuntu graphics on wikimedia commons, i don't have an account there or i'd have uploaded this file there.

Hey, man, I am a user of Ubuntu, and I'd be happy to add what I know to this article. [[User:MetalGeoff|MetalGeoff]] 03:22, 22 October 2007 (UTC)!


Nice layout.  I'll be adding to this as time/knowledge permits.
I think we should specify an LTS version for this book (8.04 for now), and stick with that version primarily, maybe with some side-notes for subsequent non-LTS versions.  Then, when the next LTS version comes out, we should copy this book in it's entirety, flag the whole book (under then new version) as &quot;in need of update&quot; or something, and then proceed to update the book and remove the &quot;in need of update&quot; flag.  Thoughts anyone?

Hello, I just wanted to comment, saying that I hope the title page of this book gets improved. The giant photos don't really have any relevance at all. In my opinion, it would be better to have a simple Ubuntu logo, with the table of contents pronounced so that readers know what to click on next.

== A couple of things ==

Although I'd love to say Ubuntu was perfect flawless, the fact that most of the world is windows centric is a big down side (possible only downside) to the OS. I think new users should be warned about what they're getting into first, before they dive into installing it, because they might not even have a Windows CD to reinstall if everything goes wrong.

One suggestion, would it be possible to copy some of the content from the Ubuntu wiki site? Their content is licensed under the same CC BY/SA, and they have some great content that can be useful for the book.  --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 22:02, 16 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

*1/2 - 1 cup sugar (or to taste)
*1/2 cup rose water or orange flower water (optional)
*1/2 cup pistachios, chopped

#Make a [[Cookbook:Slurry|slurry]] by dissolving the rice flour and cornstarch in the water and, stirring constantly, slowly add this mixture to the simmering milk.
#Simmer gently for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture has thickened sufficiently to coat a spoon. Remove from the heat.

'''Orange flower water''' is an aqueous solution of orange flowers,  the distillate left over in the preparation of neroli oil, the oil of the bitter orange tree. Its culinary use is mainly to flavour desserts. Some examples are in the Provençal orange sweet bread Pompe a l'huile, the Egyptian dessert [[Cookbook:Om Ali|Om Ali]], the Greek dessert Kritika Patouthia, the Moroccan baklava type dessert Metaxas, and in Madeleines de Commercy, a regional variation on these shell-shaped cookies.  It is also used in the cocktail [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary#R|Ramos gin fizz]] and in Thai iced tea.</text>

{{cquote|But before mankind could be ripe for a science which takes in the whole of reality, a second fundamental truth was needed, which only became common property among philosophers with the advent of Kepler and Galileo. Pure logical thinking cannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world; all knowledge of reality starts form experience and ends in it. Propositions arrived at by purely logical means are completely empty as regards reality. Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics -- indeed, of modern science altogether.|||Albert Einstein|''Ideas and Opinions''}} 

Galileo Galilei (''1564-1642'') is probably the most important individual for the birth of Science.He was born in a time when Aristotle's ''natural philosophy'' was dominant in the study of nature.Until then it was known as the only and best way to know the nature.A basic understanding of Aristotle's ''natural philosophy'' will help understanding Galileo's circumstance.

This book is intended to discuss his life-long effort to refute ''natural philosophy'' and founding new basis for ''Science''.It will be discussed through his important discoveries and quotations.The book is divided into the following chapters.

== OK ==

The above will lead you to some stuff that should help you.  Looking for others to help may be less simple but checkout editors of related books maybe.  Username change - should be no problem but you need a bureaucrat to do it.  Easiest options there will be to post on either [[User talk:Whiteknight]] or [[User talk:Withinfocus]] (or both) with the request.  Most of what I learnt came from looking at what others do!!  Give it a try - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:39, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Vasco Alexandre da Silva Costa.

I am a [[w:Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] design kind of guy, and like to build things piece by piece. I am sometimes too impatient, have a CTRL-S reflex, get bored easily and skim long winded manuals which do not interest me, often not bothering to read them at all. I earnestly devour and savor a good book: a concise, logically sequenced, and clear written book.

I am a [http://web.ist.utl.pt/~vasco.costa Computer Engineering PhD Student], at the top Engineering college in my country, [[w:Free Software|Free Software]] [http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/People#Present_administrators project developer] for over a decade, with an interest in History and Religion. I was raised a [[w:Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic]] and instructed in the [[w:Scientific Method|Scientific Method]], but feel we all need a moral compass to guide us in our modern life. I believe it is possible to organically build such a moral compass using the resources provided by WikiBooks, as elaborated in the rationale [[Free Citizens Moral Guide|here]].

I have a personal blog about these thoughts: [http://refit.blogspot.com REFIT: Refitting our World. Bit by bit].
I wish to relicense all my original content there under the Wiki Books license free for all.

I have contributed regularly to Wikipedia for years using a pseudonym. I have been away for a couple of years, and my WikiTax skills have rusted a bit.</text>

In practice I cannot access your blog (&amp; would ask you to remove it from the page you have created) as neither that or your webpage works the way you have placed it. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:44, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pauli Exclusion Principle==

The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two fermions (particles with half-integer spin such as electrons, protons, neutrons) can have identical wavefunctions. This principle follows from the definition of the [[w:rotation operator|rotation operator]] in quantum mechanics, and the derivation is outside the scope of this book. More information can be found on the [[w:Pauli exclusion principle|Wikipedia page]].

What this means for a quantum well (in any number of dimensions) is that for each quantum state, there can be only two electrons - one spin-down and one spin-up.

==Aufbau Principle==

The Aufbau Principle, from the German for &quot;build up&quot;, states that electrons in a well tend to occupy the lowest available energy levels first, before occupying higher levels. Before a higher state is used, the lowest state will have both a spin-up and spin-down electron in it.

===1-Dimensional Wells===

The digram below shows a 1D quantum well being filled by electrons. The electron are represented by a upwards arrow for spin-up and downward arrow for spin down. States with just one occupying electron are yellow and states with two are red.

[[Image:Aufbau Principle 1D.svg|center]]

When a state has only one electron, it could be either spin-up or spin-down. However, according the the Pauli Exclusion Principle, when there are two in a state, there must be one of each.

===2-Dimensional Wells===

When we have a 2-dimensional well, we can plot all the the possible states in a 2D array. This is called the '''state space'''. The digram below showns a quantum well containing 39 electrons (19 full states, and one half-full state):

[[Image:Aufbau Principle 2D (39 Electrons).svg|center]]

The energy of a given state is given by:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;E_{n_x,n_y}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[ \left( \frac{n_x \pi}{L} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{n_y \pi}{L} \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2}\left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice that the distance from the origin to the state in state space is given by the Pythagorean Theorem:

::&lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{n_x^2+n_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the energy of a state is proportional to the square of the distance from origin in state space. By the Aufbau Principle, the states closest to the origin fill with electrons first.

===Degeneracy and Hund's Rule===

Now, consider the two wavefunctions ''&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2,1&lt;/sub&gt;'' in a square 2D box. The wavefunctions are given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{n_x,n_y}=\psi_0 \sin \left( \frac{n_x \pi x}{L} \right) \sin \left( \frac{n_y \pi y}{L} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The wavefunctions, along with their associated energies, are shown below:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;z=\psi_{1,2}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;z=\psi_{2,1}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[Image:2D Wavefunction (1,2) Surface Plot.png|center|400px]]
|[[Image:2D Wavefunction (2,1) Surface Plot.png|center|400px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;E_{1,2}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[ \left( \frac{\pi}{L} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2\pi}{L} \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;E_{2,1}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[ \left( \frac{2 \pi}{L} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\pi}{L} \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We can easily see that the two energies are the same. Wavefunctions with the same energies are said to be '''degenerate'''. When the well is filling, neither one of these states will be prefered over the other for getting the first electron. However, once one state has one electron, a principle called '''Hund's Rule''' states that the other state will get the next electron before the first state receives its second. Thus, only one state is ever half-filled at one time.

===3-Dimensional Wells===

===2...f6?===
White may take the pawn with 3.Nxe5 because retaking with 3...fxe5 would result in either the loss of a rook after 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 or an irresistible attack after 4...Ke7 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ (the rest of White's pieces come out with gain of time) d5! (best. If simply 6...Kg6 7.Qf5+ Kh6 8.d4+ g5 9.h4 Black is getting mated) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.Bxb7! again winning a rook because if 8...Bxb7 then 9.Qf5+, with a similar line as to above.

The only chance for Black after 3.Nxe5 that does not lose immediately is 3...Qe7, but White has a large advantage after 4.Nf3 Qxe4+ 5.Be2 because of his large lead in development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Why Linux?===

Although Windows is the most popular OS (Operating System) for casual computer users, this does not necessarily make it the &quot;best&quot; OS. Ubuntu, which is a Linux distribution, has many features that make it a good alternative to Windows:

* '''It's free'''. True, one could download pirated versions of Windows. But that would be illegal.
* '''It's an open source operating system'''. This means anyone is entitled to download and view the source code to any/all parts of the operating system.  Or change it, to suit whatever purpose they want to use it for.  If they choose to distribute their modified version, other people can then go on to change that too, allow the software to evolve to serve different needs.
* '''It's community driven'''. This means that anyone can contribute to the effort, be it with programming, art, sounds, documentation, or answering users' questions on the Internet. It's not controlled by a Fortune 500 company with questionable legal practices.
* '''It's more reliable'''. Linux crashes far less often than Windows, unless you purposely overload the system.
* '''It's free software'''. Almost all of the software associated with the OS is available for free and can be easily installed with just a couple of clicks.
* '''It's safe'''. There are very few viruses written for Linux due to its relatively low user base (compared to Windows). There are only 49 viruses in Linux and most are patched in kernel updates (from Spatry's Cup of Linux).
**If someone were to write viruses for Linux they would have to be very sophisticated due to the fact that the virus could not be executed unless it were given root permissions.
**The virus would have to be run as the root user if it was intended to cause any serious damage due to the restrictions that normal users have by default.
**There are some viruses out there that can cause loss of users data. Just be extra careful when anyone tells you to run a command, and only take advice from trusted people/sources.
* Did I mention it's '''free''' to download, '''free''' to use, and '''free''' to upgrade, and will be '''forever'''?

===But It's too geeky for me!===
Not at all! Ubuntu is getting more and more user friendly.  Most users never have to touch a configuration file or command line if they feel uncomfortable with it.  Also, Ubuntu has all of the graphical niceties that a modern operating system has, like dazzling visual effects, piles of graphical themes, and heaps of fun games (if you've gotten tired of Solitaire and Minesweeper).

The 3D desktop effects in Ubuntu have caught the eyes of even the most avid Windows user who only dream about such effects.
The most striking example of how easy Ubuntu is lies in the fact that installation consists of just 7 easy steps which can be followed by even a beginner or non technical user.

Furthermore, even installing other softwares is very much unlike windows where all sorts of questions are asked while installation. And there is a surprise for windows users, even 10 or 20 pieces of software of your choice can be selected in a batch for installation.

The GNOME/Unity user interface is much more easy to use provided you are ready to unlearn some tedious things required in Windows.

Besides, as long as you are prepared to read manuals, any 'geeky' bits should be quite feasible - the command line looks difficult, old-fashioned and worrying, especially when you're not in a window manager with a black background, but once you've used it a little, you should find that it's really not that difficult. If you have experience with Mac or UNIX terminals it should be no sweat (no surprise, Linux uses the same thing). The same goes for other things - you may have to get used to something new and read a bit of documentation once in a while, but it shouldn't be too troublesome.

===But I'd have to partition my hard drive, and that's scary!===
Again, not necessarily. This Wikibook is currently being typed under a [[../Virtualization|Ubuntu virtual machine (VM)]]. All I have to do to return to Windows is press Ctrl+Alt! This, however, might take some experience with computers.

Alternatively, there's an installation system called Wubi that makes having Windows and Ubuntu even easier.  It installs Ubuntu into a folder on your Windows drive, completely avoiding partitioning.

Recent versions of Ubuntu have a user-friendly installer to guide you through installation - you can even just tell it to resize your windows partition and install in the free space. Be sure, however, to make sure that you don't damage partitions and back up your data.

For if you don't wish to install just yet, you can have a play with the Live CD. This will probably be slower than the installed version for you, but it's a good way to try the system out.

Alternatively, some other Linux distributions give an option to run from RAM, making the system run faster once it has booted. the downside of this is that boot time takes longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Named Constructor&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* To have a readable and intuitive way of creating objects of a class
* To impose certain constraints while creating objects of a class

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
In C++, constructors are distinguished from each other only based on the type, the order and the number of  parameters. Of course when a class has multiple constructors, each constructor has a different purpose. However, in C++ it is hard to capture that &quot;semantic&quot; difference in the interface of the class because all the constructors have the same name and only parameters can distinguish between them. Reading code with lots of constructor calls only differing in the type/order/number of parameters is quite unintuitive except for the original developer of the class. Named constructor idiom addresses the problem.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The named constructor idiom uses a set of static member functions with meaningful names to create objects instead of constructors. Constructors are either private or protected and clients have access only to the public static functions. The static functions are called &quot;named constructors&quot; as each unique way of creating an object has a different intuitive name. Consider the example below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Game
{
  public:
    static Game createSinglePlayerGame() { return Game(0); } // named constructor
    static Game createMultiPlayerGame() { return Game(1); }  // named constructor
  protected:
    Game (int game_type);
};
int main(void)
{
   Game g1 = Game::createSinglePlayerGame(); // Using named constructor
   Game g2 = Game(1); // multiplayer game; without named constructor (does not compile)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Without using the named constructor idiom in the class above, it is difficult to convey the meaning of what ''Game(1)'' and ''Game(0)'' means. The idiom makes it loud and clear! Additionally, it is possible to put certain constraints on the object creation process using this idiom. For example, named constructors could always create an object dynamically using ''new''. In such a case, [[More C++ Idioms/Resource Return|Resource Return]] idiom could be helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Named Parameter&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Simulate named (key-value pair) parameter passing style found in other languages instead of position-based parameters.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
When a function takes many parameters, the programmer has to remember the types and the order in which to pass them. Also, default values can only be given to the last parameters, so it is not possible to specify one of the later parameters and use the default value for former ones. Named parameters let the programmer pass the parameters to a function in any order and they are distinguished by a name. So the programmer can explicitly pass all the needed parameters and default values without worrying about the order used in the function declaration. 

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Named parameter idiom uses a proxy object for passing the parameters. The parameters of the function are captured as data members of the proxy class. The class exposes set methods for each parameter. The set methods return the ''*this'' object by reference so that other set methods can be chained together to set remaining parameters. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class X
{
  public:
    int a;
    char b;
    
    X() : a(-999), b('C') {}  // Initialize with default values, if any.
    X &amp; setA(int i) { a = i; return *this; } // non-const function
    X &amp; setB(char c) { b = c; return *this; } // non-const function
	
    static X create() {
      return X();
    }
};

std::ostream &amp; operator &lt;&lt; (std::ostream &amp; o, X const &amp; x)
{
	o &lt;&lt; x.a &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; x.b;
	return o;
}

int main (void)
{
  // The following code uses the named parameter idiom.
  std::cout &lt;&lt; X::create().setA(10).setB('Z') &lt;&lt; std::endl;
} 

&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Polymorphic Exception&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* To create an exception object polymorphically
* To decouple a module from the concrete details of the exceptions it may throw

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)], a popular object-oriented software design guideline states that higher level modules should not depend directly on lower level modules. Instead, both should depend on common abstractions (captured in the form of well-defined interfaces). For example, an object of type ''Person'' (say John) should not create and use an object of type ''HondaCivic'' but instead John should simply commit to a ''Car'' interface, which is an abstract base class of ''HondaCivic''. This allows John to upgrade to a ''Corvette'' easily in future without any changes to the class ''Person''. John can be &quot;configured&quot; with a concrete instance of a car (any car) using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection dependency injection] technique. Use of DIP leads to flexible and extensible modules that are easy to unit test. Unit testing is simplified by DIP because real objects can be easily replaced with mock objects using dependency injection. 

However, there are several occasions when DIP is violated: (1) while using the Singleton pattern and (2) while throwing exceptions! Singleton pattern breaks DIP because it forces the use of the concrete class name while accessing the static ''instance()'' function. A singleton should be passed as a parameter while calling a function or a constructor. A similar situation arises while dealing with exceptions in C++. The ''throw'' clause in C++ requires a concrete type name (class) to raise an exception. For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
throw MyConcreteException(&quot;Big Bang!&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Any module that throws exceptions like this immediately results into a violation of DIP. Naturally, it is harder to unit test such a module because real exception objects cannot easily be replaced with mock exception objects. A solution like the one below fails miserably as ''throw'' in C++ uses static typing and knows nothing about polymorphism.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct ExceptionBase { };
struct ExceptionDerived : ExceptionBase { };
 
void foo(ExceptionBase&amp; e)
{
   throw e; // Uses static type of e while rasing an exception.
}
int main (void)
{
  ExceptionDerived e;
  try {
    foo(e);
  }
  catch (ExceptionDerived&amp; e) {
    // Exception raised in foo does not match this catch.
  }
  catch (...) {
    // Exception raised in foo is caught here.
  }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Polymorphic exception idiom addresses the issue.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Polymorphic exception idiom simply delegates the job of raising the exception back to the derived class using a virtual function ''raise()''

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct ExceptionBase 
{ 
  virtual void raise() { throw *this; }
  virtual ~ExceptionBase() {} 
};
struct ExceptionDerived : ExceptionBase 
{ 
  virtual void raise() { throw *this; }
};
 
void foo(ExceptionBase&amp; e)
{
   e.raise(); // Uses dynamic type of e while raising an exception.
}
int main (void)
{
  ExceptionDerived e;
  try {
    foo(e);
  }
  catch (ExceptionDerived&amp; e) {
    // Exception raised in foo now matches this catch.
  }
  catch (...) {
    // not here anymore!
  }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''throw'' statement has been moved into virtual functions. The ''raise'' function invoked in function ''foo'' is polymorphic and selects the implementation in either ''ExceptionBase'' or ''ExceptionDerived'' class depending upon what is passed as a parameter (dependency injection). Type of ''*this'' is obviously known at compile-time, which results into raising a polymorphic exception. The structure of this idiom is very similar to that of [[More C++ Idioms/Virtual Constructor|Virtual Constructor]] idiom.

'''Propagating a polymorphic exception'''

Quite often an exception is handled in multiple catch statements to treat it differently in different layers of the program/library. In such cases, the earlier catch blocks need to rethrow the exception so that the outer catch blocks, if any, may take the necessary actions. When a polymorphic exception is involved, inner catch block(s) may modify the exception object before passing it on to the catch blocks up in the stack. In such cases, care must be taken to ensure that the original exception object is propagated. Consider a seemingly innocuous looking program below, which fails to do that.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
try {
    foo(e); // throws an instance of ExceptionDerived as before.
  }
  catch (ExceptionBase&amp; e) // Note the base class. Exception is caught polymorphically.
  {
    // Handle the exception. May modify the original exception object.
    throw e; // Warning! Object slicing is underway.
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''throw e'' statement does not throw the original exception object. Instead, it throws a sliced copy (only ExceptionBase part) of the original object because it considers the static type of the expression in front of it. Silently, the derived exception object was not only lost but also translated into the base type exception object. The catch blocks up in the stack do not have access to the same information this catch had. There are two ways to address the problem.

* Simply use ''throw;'' (without any expression following it). It will rethrow the original exception object.
* Use polymorphic exception idiom again. It will throw a copy of the original exception object because the ''raise()'' virtual function uses ''throw *this''.


&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
try {
    foo(e); // throws an instance of ExceptionDerived as before.
  }
  catch (ExceptionBase&amp; e) // Note the base class. Exception is caught polymorphically.
  {
    // Handle the exception. May modify the original exception object.
    // Use only one of the following two.
    throw;      // Option 1:  Original derived exception is thrown.
    e.raise();  // Option 2:  A copy of the original derived exception object is thrown.
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Virtual Constructor&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To create a copy of an object or a new object without knowing its concrete type.

=== Also Known As ===
Factory Method of initialization

=== Motivation ===
Uses of calling member functions in a class hierarchy polymorphically are well known in the object-oriented programming community. It is a way of implementing the '''is-a''' (or more practically, '''behaves-as-a''') relationship. Sometimes it is useful to call life-cycle management (creation, copy, and destruction) functions of a class hierarchy polymorphically. 

C++ natively supports polymorphic destruction of objects using a virtual destructor. An equivalent support for creation and copying of objects is missing. In C++, creation of object(s) always requires its type to be known at compile-time. The Virtual Constructor idiom allows polymorphic creation of and copying of objects in C++.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The effect of a virtual constructor by a create() member function for creation and a clone() member function for copy construction as shown below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Employee 
{
  public:
    virtual ~Employee () {}                 // Native support for polymorphic destruction.
    virtual Employee * create () const = 0; // Virtual constructor (creation) 
    virtual Employee * clone () const = 0;  // Virtual constructor (copying) 
};
class Manager : public Employee     // &quot;is-a&quot; relationship
{
  public:
    Manager ();                     // Default constructor
    Manager (Manager const &amp;);      // Copy constructor
    virtual ~Manager () {}                  // Destructor
    Manager * create () const       // Virtual constructor (creation) 
    {
      return new Manager();
    }
    Manager * clone () const        // Virtual constructor (copying) 
    {
      return new Manager (*this);
    }
};
class Programmer : public Employee { /* Very similar to the Manager class */ };
Employee * duplicate (Employee const &amp; e)
{
   return e.clone();  // Using virtual constructor idiom.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The Manager class implements the two pure virtual functions and uses the type name (Manager) to create them. The function duplicate shows how virtual constructor idiom is used. It does not really know what it is duplicating. It only knows that it is cloning an Employee. The responsibility of creating the right instance is delegated to the derived classes. The duplicate function is therefore closed for modifications even though the class hierarchy rooted at Employee gets more sub-classes added in the future. 

The return type of the clone and create member functions of the Manager class is not Employee but the class itself. C++ allows this flexibility in types where the return type of the over-ridden function can be a derived type of that of the function in the base class. This language feature is known as '''co-variant return types.''' 

To handle resource ownership properly, the [[More C++ Idioms/Resource Return|Resource Return]] idiom should be employed for the return types of clone() and create() functions as they are factory functions. If used, the return types (shared_ptr&lt;Employee&gt; and shared_ptr&lt;Manager&gt;) are no longer covariant return types and program should fail to compile. In such a case, the virtual constructor functions in the derived class should return the exact type as in the parent class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;tr1/memory&gt;

class Employee
{
  public:
    typedef std::tr1::shared_ptr&lt;Employee&gt; Ptr;
    virtual ~Employee () {}                    // Native support for polymorphic destruction.
    virtual Ptr create () const = 0; // Virtual constructor (creation)
    virtual Ptr clone () const = 0;  // Virtual constructor (copying)
};
class Manager : public Employee     // &quot;is-a&quot; relationship
{
  public:
    Manager () {}                     // Default constructor
    Manager (Manager const &amp;) {}      // Copy constructor
    virtual ~Manager () {}
    Ptr create () const       // Virtual constructor (creation)
    {
      return Ptr(new Manager());
    }
    Ptr clone () const        // Virtual constructor (copying)
    {
      return Ptr(new Manager (*this));
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Virtual Friend Function&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Simulate a virtual friend function.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Friend functions are often needed in C++. A canonical example is that of types that can be printed to output streams (''e.g.,'' std::cout). An overloaded left-shift operator function, which is often a friend, is needed to achieve seamless streaming capabilities. Friend functions are really an ''extension'' of the class's interface. However, friend functions in C++ can not be declared virtual and therefore no dynamic binding of friend functions is possible. Applying a friend function to an entire hierarchy of classes becomes awkward if an overloaded friend function is needed for every class in the hierarchy. This lack of support for dynamic binding makes it hard to justify that are in fact an ''extension'' of the class's interface. Virtual friend function idiom addresses this concern elegantly.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Virtual friend function idiom makes use of an extra indirection to achieve the desired effect of dynamic binding for friend functions. In this idiom, usually there is only one function that is a friend of the base class of the hierarchy and the friend function simply delegates the work to a helper member function that is virtual. The helper function is overridden in every derived class, which does the real job and the friend function just serves as a facade. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Base {
  public:
    friend ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (ostream&amp; o, const Base&amp; b);
    // ...
  protected:
    virtual void print(ostream&amp; o) const
    { ... }
};
/* make sure to put this function into the header file */
inline std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; o, const Base&amp; b)
{
  b.print(o); // delegate the work to a polymorphic member function.
  return o;
}

class Derived : public Base {
  protected:
    virtual void print(ostream&amp; o) const
    { ... }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Resource Acquisition Is Initialization&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* To guarantee release of resource(s) at the end of a scope
* To provide basic exception safety guarantee

=== Also Known As ===
* Execute-Around Object
* Resource Release Is Finalization
* Scope-Bound Resource Management

=== Motivation ===
Resources acquired in a function scope should be released before leaving the scope unless the ownership is being transferred to another scope or object. Quite often it means a pair of function calls - one to acquire a resource and another one to release it. For example, new/delete, malloc/free, acquire/release, file-open/file-close, nested_count++/nested_count--, etc. It is quite easy to forget to write the &quot;release&quot; part of the resource management &quot;contract&quot;. Sometimes the resource release function is never invoked: this can happen when the control flow leaves the scope because of return or an exception. It is too dangerous to trust the programmer that he or she will invoke resource release operation in all possible cases in the present and  in the future. Some examples are given below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void foo ()
{
  char * ch = new char [100];
  if (...)
     if (...)
        return;
     else if (...)
            if (...)
  else
     throw &quot;ERROR&quot;;

  delete [] ch; // This may not be invoked... memory leak!
}
void bar ()
{
  lock.acquire();
  if (...)
     if (...)
        return;
  else
     throw &quot;ERROR&quot;;

  lock.release(); // This may not be invoked... deadlock!
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is in general control flow abstraction problem. Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) is an extremely popular idiom in C++ that relieves the burden of calling &quot;resource release&quot; operation in a clever way.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The idea is to wrap the resource release operation in a destructor of an object in the scope. Language guarantees that the destructor will always be invoked (of a successfully constructed object) when control flow leaves the scope because of a return statement or an exception.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
//  Private copy constructor and copy assignment ensure classes derived 
//  from class NonCopyable cannot be copied.
class NonCopyable 
{
   NonCopyable (NonCopyable const &amp;); // private copy constructor
   NonCopyable &amp; operator = (NonCopyable const &amp;); // private assignment operator
};
template &lt;class T&gt;
class AutoDelete : NonCopyable
{
  public:
    AutoDelete (T * p = 0) : ptr_(p) {}
    ~AutoDelete () throw() { delete ptr_; } 
  private:
    T *ptr_;
};

class ScopedLock : NonCopyable// Scoped Lock idiom
{
  public:
    ScopedLock (Lock &amp; l) : lock_(l) { lock_.acquire(); }
    ~ScopedLock () throw () { lock_.release(); } 
  private:
    Lock&amp; lock_;
};

void foo ()
{
  X * p = new X;
  AutoDelete&lt;X&gt; safe_del(p); // Memory will not leak
  p = 0;
  // Although, above assignment &quot;p = 0&quot; is not necessary
  // as we would not have a dangling pointer in this example. 
  // It is a good programming practice.

  if (...)
    if (...)
      return; 
 
  // No need to call delete here.
  // Destructor of safe_del will delete memory
}
void X::bar()
{
  ScopedLock safe_lock(l); // Lock will be released certainly
  if (...)
    if (...)
      throw &quot;ERROR&quot;; 
  // No need to call release here.
  // Destructor of safe_lock will release the lock
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Acquiring resource(s) in constructor is not mandatory in RAII idiom but releasing resources in the destructor is the key. Therefore, it is also known (rarely though) as '''Resource Release is Finalization idiom'''. It is important in this idiom that the destructor should not throw exceptions. Therefore, the destructors have no-throw specification but it is optional. std::auto_ptr and boost::scoped_ptr are ways of quickly using RAII idiom for memory resources. RAII is also used to ensure exception safety. RAII makes it possible to avoid resource leaks without extensive use of try/catch blocks and is widely used in the software industry.

Many classes that manage resources using RAII, do not have legitimate copy semantics (''e.g.,'' network connections, database cursors, mutex). The ''NonCopyable'' class shown before prevents copying of objects that implement RAII. It simply prevents access to the copy-constructor and the copy-assignment operator by making them private. ''boost::scoped_ptr'' is an example of one such class that prevents copying while holding memory resources. The ''NonCopyable'' class states this intention explicitly and prevents compilation if used incorrectly. Such classes should not be used in STL containers. However, every resource management class that implements RAII does not have to be non-copyable like the above two examples. If copy semantics are desired, ''boost::shared_ptr'' can be used to manage memory resources. In general, [[More C++ Idioms/Detached Counted Body|non-intrusive reference counting]] is used to provide copy semantics as well as RAII.

=== Consequences ===
RAII is not without its limitations. The resources which are not memory and must be released deterministically and may throw exceptions usually aren't handled very well by C++ destructors. That's because a C++ destructor can't propagate errors to the enclosing scope (which is potentially winding up). It has no return value and it should not propagate exceptions outside itself. If exceptions are possible, then the destructor must handle the exceptional case within itself somehow. Nevertheless, RAII remains the most widely used resource management idiom in C++.

=== Known Uses ===
* Virtually all non-trivial C++ software
* std::unique_ptr (and std::auto_ptr)
* std::shared_ptr
* boost::mutex::scoped_lock

* [http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/ScopedLocking.pdf Scoped Locking] idiom is a special case of RAII applied to operating system synchronization primitives such as mutex and semaphores.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:01, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

== Usefulness ==

I see you doubt your own usefulness already! As a seasoned wikiversity participant, and a wikinewsie, you're obviously not a new user to the whole wiki- system. On wikibooks we write instructional books. If you are interested, you could write a book about journalism (how to get a good story, how to write reports, etc). Since you are experienced in other projects, You might want to help out with an upcoming project that we have, a helpbook for using mediawiki and using the various wikimedia projects. 

If you aren't interested in writing, we have all the common tasks of any project that you can jump into: double-redirects, stubs, vandalism, unlicensed images, etc. check out [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance]] if you are interested in that kind of stuff. 

Otherwise, just let me know what you are interested in. Chances are we either have a book on that subject that you can contribute to, or else we need a book on it that you can start! If you need any help, let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:05, 6 August 2007 (UTC)
:I'd be interested - at least - in commenting on how to navigate and get stuff up on Wikinews. That is something I could help out with. Our style is quite different to Wikipedia and there is an urgency about reporting news that some find a turn-off. As to a book on Journalism... I'm an amateur - although I did manage to [[wikinews:Wikinews:Story preparation/Interview with U.K. statesman Tony Benn|land an interview]] with [[w:Tony Benn|Tony Benn]]. Any bookies want to add a question in the next 24 hours? --[[User:Brianmc|Brianmc]] 10:57, 7 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

=== What does this template do? ===
This template generates links to the documentation of library modules. For example, if you talk about &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt; and want the text to be a proper link to the latest haddocks, this template is for you.

The links point to the library documentation on [http://hackage.haskell.org/ Hackage]. You have to specify the exact version of a package. The default is &lt;code&gt;package=base|version=4.1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;. Short forms are allowed, i.e. &lt;code&gt;p=base|v=4.1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;. Exception: in the special case of the Prelude, it will link to the language standard.

Arguably, automatic syntax coloring and hyperlinking of Haskell source code should obsolete this template.

=== Usage ===
{|
|-
| source
| result
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Haskell lib|Control|Monad}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| {{Haskell lib|Control|Monad}} from the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;-package.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Haskell lib|p=mtl|v=1.1.0.0|Control|Monad|State}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| {{Haskell lib|p=mtl|v=1.1.0.0|Control|Monad|State}} from the version 1.0.0.0 of the &lt;code&gt;mtl&lt;/code&gt;-package.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Haskell lib|Prelude}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| {{Haskell lib|Prelude}} from the language standard.
|}

Currently, the module name may be only 5 levels deep, but that's easy to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Electronic business''' is an ever-changing field. Things can get obsolete before you know it. One good way of handling the rapid change is building a good knowledge base of the basics. 

===Where did it all come from?===
It may seem strange for the first time reader,but like many other relevant technologies of the day (e.g.: [[w:GPS|Global Positioning Systems]]) The Internet has its roots in the US Department of Defense. The initial idea seems to be building a network which would work even if one or more servers were annihilated  in an enemy attack. Along with the military objectives, there were other potential benefits namely, information sharing ,electronic transactions , efficient collaboration and community building (e.g.: [[w:BBS|Bulletin Board System]]).These potential benefits and uses made the tiny ARPANET evolve into the internet as we know today.  

===Pillars and principles ===
The two major pillars which support an e-business infrastructure are as follows:
* '''Legal Standards''': These include legal licensing documents (End user licenses etc.) and other related legal documents like Privacy policies. These are important in an e-business environment so that any misuse of the digital infrastructure can be dealt with legally.
* '''Technical standards''': These documents are essential to standardize protocols and other basic technologies so that multiple manufacturers and businesses  can manufacture devices and systems based on the particular technology . As a result the consumer  has a choice of vendors to choose from. Technical standards also ensure compatibility across the network. 

===Brick and mortar v/s e-business===
Traditional brick and mortar business were basically product centric . Companies competed on their products and the consumer was largely sidelined. This approach resulted in a slow product evolution cycle. Apart from isolating the customer from the product development, other serious drawbacks in the brick and mortar stlyle of business included poor scaling of the business . The business will typically be confined to a geographic location and expanding required huge investments . Electronic business  overcomes all these problems. E-business has a customer centric approach and the customer is a part of the product development cycle. Customer interaction and product feedback allow the product to be refined in a much shorter time span.

Unlike Brick and mortar businesses, information is vital for e-business. Along with information , systems capable of storing , processing and retrieving the information are also crucial to the success of e-business.

===What infrastructure do I need?===
For an e-business to be successfully built on the principles stated above, One needs infrastructure which can fulfill the needs of capturing , processing and storing data. This infrastructure must have the following attributes.

The infrastructure should be:
* Centralized
* Scalable
* Platform independent
* Localized (to allow a global implementation)
* Updated and synchronized
* Available  (to all employees who may need the information)
* Integrated

===Models of e-business===
Models of e-business can be basically classified into three categories .

* '''B2B''' - The Business to Business model of e-commerce deal with companies transacting with other companies and institutions. Many companies provide software as a service to other companies. These would be grouped int he B2B model.  This model is usually implemented in the service sector.

* '''B2C''' - The Business to consumer model deals with companies transacting with individuals . This is a common model wherein the company advertises its products or  services through an electronic media such as the internet . The customer visits the media front end (usually a browser) and buys products using online payment methods.  In a B2C model the company takes the responsibility of the quality of the product, the safety of the online transaction and the shipping operation. Examples of sites operating on this model are Think geek , Amazon and Air Deccan.

* '''C2C''' - The consumer to consumer model deals with consumers transacting with other consumers . The enterprise (e-business)  here acts as an intermediary and facilitates transactions between consumers. In a B2C model the company usually does not guarantee the quality and the shipping time of the product.  The C2C  company has to have good content management systems  to handle the large amount of  products  displayed  and the  relatively large amount of  transactions. examples of businesses following the C2C  model are  eBay, Craigslist, Orkut.

'''Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Portugal|Portuguese dish]] of [[Cookbook:Salt cod|salt cod]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] created in the 19th century by Gomes de Sá at the restaurant ''Restaurante Lisbonense'' in the city of Porto.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:en:Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá|Wikipedia article]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Bacalhau is the Portuguese word for [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]] as well as for salt cod and the dishes made from it.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]] [[Cookbook:Salt cod|salt cod]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*4 medium-sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely-chopped
*6 medium-sized [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*20 [[Cookbook:Olive|pitted black olives]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|hard-boiled eggs]], sliced
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs.]] [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], finely chopped

==Procedure==

#Starting the day before, soak the salt cod, refrigerated, in a container of water for 16 - 24 hours, changing the water 3 or 4 times.
#Drain and rinse the cod. Place in a saucepan and fill with water to cover the fish by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 20 minutes until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  Drain thoroughly and flake the fish coarsely, removing any skin or bones with a paring knife. Set aside.
#Boil the potatoes in their skins until easily pierced with a fork or skewer but not soft. Drain, cool and peel. Slice into ¼-inch slices. Set aside.
#In a heavy frying-pan, heat a ½ cup of olive oil over medium high heat for two minutes.  Add the sliced onion and sautée for about 6 or 7 minutes until the onions are translucent and slightly brown. Stir in the garlic and remove from the heat.
#To assemble, lay half the potatoes in the bottom of a casserole.  Cover them with half the cod and then half the onion. Repeat with the rest and drizzle the rest of the olive oil over the top.
#Bake for about 20 minutes in a 400ºF/200ºC oven until the top is lightly browned.&lt;ref&gt;SAVE ENERGY. Do not preheat your oven unless it is absolutely necessary (e.g., cakes, pastries and roasting).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Garnish with olives and hard-boiled egg slices. Sprinkle with parsley.
#Serve from the casserole with a cruet of olive oil and port vinegar on the side.

[[Image:Simple_design_intro_450.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. The new procedure is based on Daisy's theorem and Plato's formula.&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Novel design procedure ==

It seems that there is nothing new to say about single op-amp amplifying circuits. Only, the innovator [http://dknollman.122mb.com/ Dieter Knollman] has suggested a new simpler design procedure in an [http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4341150/03-02-98-Designing-with-op-amps-Single-formula-technique-keeps-it-simple EDN's article] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4341150/03-02-98-Designing-with-op-amps-Single-formula-technique-keeps-it-simple Single-formula technique keeps it simple]&lt;/ref&gt;. He has also placed his [http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Design.html work] on the web&lt;ref&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Design.html K9 analysis] make analog circuit design and analysis doggone simple&lt;/ref&gt;. His idea is described more concisely in [[Electronics/Op-Amps#Quick_Design_Process|Electronics]].

The active design procedure&lt;ref&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Shadow.html Shadow's Design Procedure] creates a passive or single op-amp circuit to implement a linear circuit equation.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the new Daisy's theorem&lt;ref name = Daisy&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Daisy.html Daisy’s Theorem] states that the sum of all voltage gains is equal to one.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plato's gain formula&lt;ref name = Plato&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Plato.html Plato's gain formula] defines the gains of a single op-amp amplifiying circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;. The result is amazing especially for summing op-amp circuits with multiple positive-gain inputs: you can calculate the resistor values for each input by using the same formula R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/|gain|! It sounds wonderful, doesn't it? 
Only, in order to really understand things we, human beings, need to grasp the basic ideas behind them. Then, let's reveal the ideas behind this mystic procedure following the heuristic approach of the famous mathematician [[w:George Polya|George Polya]]. For this purpose, we will cite the original text in an ''italic'' type and will interpret it in a normal type.

Of course, it would be best if the author tells how he has invented the procedure. So, we suggest contributing to this page.

Author - Plato's Gain Formula is a simplification of the General Summing Amplifier gain formula.  The GSA formula is derived via K9 Analysis, a dog-gone simple way to obtain circuit equations.

== What does Daisy's theorem mean? ==

'''[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Daisy.html Daisy’s Theorem] tells: ''the sum of the gains in a single op-amp amplifying circuit is equal to 1''''' &lt;ref name = Daisy&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Daisy.html Daisy’s Theorem: the sum of the gains is equal to 1]&lt;/ref&gt;. Only, don't you think that it seems quite strange to sum gains? It is far natural to think that  voltage summers sum voltages! Then, let's examine this author's assertion.

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_par_sum_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. A parallel summer sums products of gains and voltages.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Scrutinizing the material we will find out that Daisy's theorem concerns mainly ''parallel voltage summing circuits''. What they are? Can such circuits exist at all (we usually think we must not connect in parallel voltage sources with different voltages)?

Daisy's comment - The theorem applies to linear circuits, with ideal voltage source inputs. The node voltage is a linear equation containing inputs and gain.  The equation shows how via superposition each input contributes to the node voltage, the gain.  The theorem applies to all nodes.

As you probably know, we can sum voltages directly by connecting the voltage sources in series (according to Kirchhoff's voltage law). In this ''series voltage summer'', the whole input voltages participate in the overall sum:

&lt;center&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... V&lt;sub&gt;INn&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Only, a problem with the common ground appears - some input voltage sources or the load remain flying. Then, we can sum voltages indirectly by connecting the voltage sources &quot;in parallel&quot; through resistors (according to Kirchhoff's current law). In this ''parallel  voltage summer'', the input voltages are weighted by coefficients α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt; 1, in case of passive summer) or gains G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (&gt; 1, in case of active summer):

&lt;center&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.V&lt;sub&gt;INn&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The equation simply means that the circuit is linear, superposition applies.  

In this common case (Fig. 2), the parallel summer sums products of gains and voltages. Now imagine that all the input coefficients α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (or gains Gi) are equal to 1. As a result, the summer will sums voltages as above - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... V&lt;sub&gt;INn&lt;/sub&gt;. Well, why do not we assume that all the input voltages are equal to 1V? In this case, the summer will sum coefficients (gains) - G&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = G&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... G&lt;sub&gt;INn&lt;/sub&gt;; now, the output voltage represents the overall gain! An example: a DAC is just a summer with digital-controlled binary-weighted input voltages (at constant input resistances) or gains (at constant input voltages equal to the reference voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;).

Maybe, the best way to understand what Daisy's theorem means is to apply it to various  summing circuits. Well, let's begin!


=== Passive summer ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_pas_sum_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. The sum of the weighted input coefficients (including ground) of a ''passive parallel voltage summer'' is 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let's first prove Daisy's theorem in the case of the simplest ''passive parallel summer''. We may observe the parallel summing phenomenon in nature and our routine: (input) power sources connected in parallel through some &quot;resistances&quot; to the same (output) point where their influences are superimposed. For example, imagine how sources fight each other like as people in the game ''tug of war'' or ''arm wrestling''.

Similarly, in an ''electrical passive parallel voltage summer'' (Fig. 3) the input voltage sources are connected &quot;in parallel&quot; through resistors to the same output point. The sources try to change the output voltage by &quot;sucking&quot; or &quot;blowing&quot; a current from/through the common point. As a result, their influences (voltages) are superimposed in the output point.

Why is there a need of resistances at all?
Well, zero one resistance and you will see that the corresponding source completely controls the output -- the output no longer depends on any of the other sources.
It's no longer the &quot;summer&quot; we wanted.
Zero two or more resistances? Even worse than zeroing just one -- it directly shorts the voltage sources in a damaging short-circuit.
The resistances are necessary to allow every input to have some ''influence'' on the sum.

The resistors continuously dissipate power.

After this intuitive viewpoint at the bare summing circuit let's make a bit more serious analysis. Regarding to each input, the summing circuit is a voltage divider composed by two resistances: the input resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) and the equivalent resistance of the remaining resistances (R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;). Note that the third input voltage is zero (the corresponding resistor is just connected to the ground). In this way, the inputs attenuate the voltages by coefficients α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; according to the well-known voltage divider formula (Fig. 3).

Now, if we sum the input coefficients, we establish an interesting fact: the sum of the input coefficients is 1! When we decrease one resistance, its coefficient increases while the others decrease and v.v.; the coefficients shade one into other! We have reached a conclusion that the bare passive summing circuit obeys Daisy's theorem!

Only, what do we do, if we would like to set arbitrary input coefficients? What if we want ones that do not sum to 1? Eureka! We can connect an additional resistor to the ground with a complementary coefficient! This &quot;parasitic&quot; ''ground resistor'' will take off gain from the input coefficients; it acts as an attenuating element. ''Example 1:'' If we have chosen α1 = 0.4 and α2 = 0.6, there is no need of a ground resistor because their sum is exactly 1. ''Example 2:'' If we have chosen α1 = 0.4 and α2 = 0.4, there is a need of a ground resistor with α1 = 0.2; it adds the sum up to 1.

If you convert this circuit into a Norton equivalent circuit, the analysis becomes trivial.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Non-inverting summer ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_noninv_sum_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. The sum of the input gains of a ''buffered parallel voltage summer'' is K.&lt;/center&gt;]]

If we would like the summer to amplify, we may connect a non-inverting buffering amplifier with gain K after the bare summing circuits (Fig. 4). Obviously, in this case, the sum of the input gains will appear to constitute K:

&lt;center&gt;(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).K = K&lt;/center&gt;

In this arrangement, the function of the ground resistor is the same as [[#Passive summer|above]]: it lets us set arbitrary input coefficients (not only complementing to K). Here, it takes off gain from the input gains but the overall sum remains equal to K.

Daisy's theorem states that the sum is always equal to one, at the amplifier input and also at the output.  The amplifier must have a hidden ground that will have a gain of (1-k).

If you construct a complete schematic for this circuit, you may notice that the circuit has a ground resistor on both op-amp inputs.  This will degrade performance.

Moral - Always use complete schematics.  


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Inverting summer ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_inv_sum_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. The sum of the gains of an ''inverting parallel voltage summer'' is K - 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Whenever possible, we prefer to use the clearer ''inverting summer''. 
The inverting summer is easy to design, but provides inferior performance.
Moral - K9 is simple for all cases.  Design for performance.

The idea of this clever circuit (Fig. 5) is simple: the op-amp &quot;neutralizes&quot; the &quot;disturbing&quot; output voltage of the imperfect passive summing circuits by an equivalent &quot;antivoltage&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-v-active-sum-old.html Op-amp inverting summer] is an animated flash tutorial, which builds the famous circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html Op-amp Circuit Builder] ([http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/et_2003/builder/builder.pdf movie philosophy]) is an interactive flash tutorial that builds various op-amp inverting circuits.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/virtual_ground/virtual_ground.htm How do we create a virtual ground?] is a circuit story about the great phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverting summer like as the non-inverting one has weighted inputs. If we assume that the gain of the equivalent [[#Non-inverting amplifier|non-inverting amplifier]] is K, we can establish that the sum of the input negative gains constitutes K-1:


G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;

G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/(1/R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;+1/R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;+1/R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) = K - 1


It is interesting to see what happens, if we add a ground resistor to the inverting input. Now, it adds gain to the overall sum without affecting the other inverting input gains.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

Here's another example of an incomplete schematic.  The (+) op-amp input is not shown.
The circuit will not function without a (+) input.

Daisy's theorem only applies to complete circuits.  This circuit will be rejected by SPICE.
It's easy to construct figures that violate circuit principles.

Moral - The internet contains contains many circuit figures that can't function.  You need to recognize these.

=== Mixed summer ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_mix_sum_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. The sum of the gains of a ''mixed parallel voltage summer'' is 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Usually, op-amps have differential inputs (if we need only a bare single-input, we just ground the &quot;unused&quot; input). So, we can connect summing circuits to both non-inverting and inverting inputs. In this way, we obtain a ''universal summing-subtracting circuit'' - Fig. 6 (the author has named it ''general summing amplifier'').

Looking from the positive-input side, the sum of the positive input coefficients (between the sources and the non-inverting op-amp's input) is as usual 1 and the sum of the positive input gains (between the sources and the op-amp's output) is K.

Looking from the negative-input side, the sum of the negative input gains (between the sources and the op-amp's output) is K - 1. As a result, (the sum of the positive gains) - (the sum of the negative gains) = 1. Wonderful! The circuit obeys Daisy's theorem!

How does a ground resistor affect the circuit? Adding a ground resistor to the non-inverting input takes off gain from the positive input gains but the overall sum of gains (caused by the non-inverting inputs) remains equal to K. The reason: the ground resistor does not affect the negative feedback.

Adding a ground resistor to the inverting input doesn't affect the other inverting input gains but it increases proportionally the positive input gains. The reason: the ground resistor affects the negative feedback. This action increases both the sums (inverting and non-inverting) but the difference remains as before equal to 1. Maybe, these observations have given an idea to the author to introduce a coefficient '''p''' into Plato's formula... 

p is needed if a circuit has not been optimally designed. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;
A better circuit, but not without problems.  Since Rg is connected to the (-) op-amp input, it may not be equal to zero.  Plato's gain formula reveals this. Rg is in the denominator.

Some mixed sum circuits will Rg connected to the (+) input.  A short is allowed here.

Moral - Don't trust simple circuit tricks.  Look at formulas and assumptions.

=== Non-inverting amplifier ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_non-inv_ampl_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. The sum of the gains of a ''non-inverting amplifier'' is 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The author claims that even the most elementary op-amp amplifying circuits obey Daisy's theorem. Then, let's examine this assertion beginning by the classic ''non-inverting amplifier''.

We can think of a non-inverting amplifier just as a &quot;degenerated&quot; summing-subtracting circuit, if we assume that the ground acts as another input (''...most op-amp circuits are a subset of the general summing circuit; for example, a non-inverting amplifier would have a single positive input and a single negative input that is connected to ground...'').

Well, let's see, if the circuit obeys Daisy's theorem:

&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = K - (K - 1) = 1&lt;/center&gt;

It obeys the theorem!

It even works for the most elementary circuit, a short from input to output.
V(out) = 1 * Vin

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Inverting amplifier ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_inv_ampl_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. The sum of the gains of an ''inverting amplifier'' is 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Similarly, we can think of an ''inverting amplifier'' as a &quot;degenerated&quot; summing-subtracting circuit assuming again that the ground acts as another input (''...for example, an inverting amplifier would have a single positive input that is ground and a single negative input...'').

Let's see again, if the circuit obeys Daisy's theorem:

&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = K - (K - 1) = 1&lt;/center&gt;

It obeys the theorem too!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Differential amplifier ===

[[Image:Simple_design_daisy_diff_ampl_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. The sum of the gains of a ''differential amplifier'' is 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Actually, the inverting and non-inverting amplifiers are differential circuits that subtract the input voltage from the &quot;ground&quot; voltage. From this viewpoint, the ground voltage is just an input voltage. Only, they are unbalanced circuits because the two input gains differ by 1. We can balance the circuits, if we decrease by 1 the non-inverting input gain or, if we increase by 1 the inverting input gain. The first technique is more popular; it leads to the classic circuit of an ''op-amp differential amplifier''. 

In this circuit, the non-inverting input resistor R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; and the ground resistor R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; constitute a voltage divider, which attenuates two times the input voltage. Let's see, if the circuit obeys Daisy's theorem:

&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.K + α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.K - (K - 1) = 0.5K + 0.5K - (K - 1) = 1&lt;/center&gt;


It obeys the theorem too!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== What is the role of the &quot;ground resistor&quot;? ===

Finally, let's generalize the role of the ground resistor in all the circuits discussed.

The ground resistor adds the gain needed in the case when the sum of the signal gains does not constitute 1. 

Three cases are possible:

1. If the signal gain sum is more than 1, we connect a ground resistor to the inverting op-amp input.

2. If the signal gain sum is less than 1, we connect a ground resistor to the non-inverting op-amp input.

3. If the signal gain sum is exactly 1, we do not connect a ground resistor.

Is the ground resistor a &quot;parasitic&quot; component? Not always! For example, in the circuit of an inverting amplifier, it is a vital element!  Give example where it is a &quot;parasitic&quot; component.

Daisy's theorem shown when a ground resistor is needed.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== What does Plato's formula mean? ==

'''[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Plato.html Plato's gain formula] tells: ''the &quot;non-inverting&quot; gains R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are proportional to the ratio between the &quot;feedback&quot; resistor R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and the input resistance R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt;ref name = Plato&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Plato.html Plato's gain formula] defines the gains of a single op-amp amplifiying circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;. What does it mean?

Once we defined the gains (by using Daisy's theorem), we have to determine the magnitudes of the circuit resistors. There is no problem to calculate resistances connected to the inverting input; only, it is too difficult to calculate the resistances connected to the non-inverting input.
Fortunately, the author has managed to find out an interesting relation (he has named it Plato's formula&lt;ref name = Plato&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Plato.html Plato's gain formula] defines the gains of a single op-amp amplifiying circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;): the &quot;non-inverting&quot; gains R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are proportional to the ratio between the &quot;feedback&quot; resistor R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and the input resistance R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = p.R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The coefficient of proportionality '''p''' is the same for all the positive gains and is equal to the ratio between the two equivalent resistances connected to the op-amp inputs:

&lt;center&gt;p = R&lt;sub&gt;e(+)&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If the equivalent resistances are equal (this is just what we want, in order to minimize bias-current error), then p = 1 and G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is really doggone simple! It sounds wonderful! Only, we would like to know what the idea behind Plato's formula is. As the author has hidden the idea, let's try to reveal it by ourselves.

Author - There is no circuit trick, just K9 Analysis (a simplified form of Node Analysis).  The intent of K9 is avoid tricks and to make Analog Circuit Design and Analysis Dog-Gone Simple.

=== A key for understanding: ''equalizing the input resistances'' === 

Obviously, we have to find some relation between the circuit parameters that can help us to simplify the calculations. Well, let's try using the requirement for equal equivalent input resistances R&lt;sub&gt;e(+)&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt;, which minimizes the error caused by the input bias currents. What is this mean?

If the equivalent input resistances connected to the op-amp inputs are different, the op-amp input bias currents produce different voltages across the resistances; their difference acts as an undesired differential input voltage. In order to compensate this harmful voltage, we can make equal the two equivalent input resistances (a favorite compensation technique in op-amp design). Usually, this means to connect an additional resistor between the op-amp input having lower resistance and the ground; its resistance is equal to the equivalent resistance connected to the other input. As a result, the op-amp input bias currents produce equal voltages; their difference acts as a common-mode input voltage that is rejected by the op-amp.

Well, let's now apply this technique to the same op-amp summing circuits, in order to reveal the idea behind Plato's formula.

=== Op-amp inverting amplifier ===

[[Image:Simple_design_inv_ampl_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. Op-amp inverting amplifier.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let's begin with the op-amp inverting amplifier illustrated in Fig. 10.
Some people &quot;simplify&quot; this circuit by replace R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; with a zero value resistor (a wire).
This simplified circuit consists only of two phyical resistors and an op-amp.
The resulting R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 circuit seems to violate Daisy's theorem.

When we set R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, the equivalent input resistances are very different (R&lt;sub&gt;e(+)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;).
Theoretically (with an ideal op amp) this seems to be OK.
But when we use a real op-amp, its equal input bias currents flowing through the these unequal equivalent input resistances cause an undesired offset voltage.

To compensate, we replace the zero-ohm wire, between the &quot;+&quot; input pin and the ground with a real resistor R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;. Equalizing equivalent input resistances requires R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 10).

Now, if we substitute the term R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) with K (the gain of the equivalent non-inverting amplifier), we will get the Plato's formula for the inverting amplifier:

&lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/K = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The ground resistor R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; does not define the ground gain; it only compensates the undesired voltage drop caused by the input bias current.

And so Daisy's Theorem is true of a properly compensated inverting amplifier.

(Compared to the properly compensated circuit, the &quot;simplified&quot; R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 circuit has degraded performance).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Op-amp non-inverting amplifier ===

[[Image:Simple_design_noninv_ampl_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11. Op-amp non-inverting amplifier.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Then, let's consider the next elementary op-amp amplifying circuit - the ''non-inverting amplifier''. Following the same compensation technique, we connect an additional resistor between the input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and the op-amp non-inverting input having resistance R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 11).

Now, if we substitute the term R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) with K (the gain of the non-inverting amplifier), we will get the Plato's formula for the non-inverting amplifier:

&lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/K = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As above, R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; does not define the voltage gain; it only compensates the undesired voltage drop caused by the input bias current.

(Like the &quot;simplified&quot; inverting amplifier, the &quot;simplified&quot; R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 non-inverting amplifier has degraded performance when compared to a properly compensated non-inverting amplifier).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Op-amp non-inverting summer ===

[[Image:Simple_design_plato_noninv_sum_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 12. Op-amp non-inverting summer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

It is time to consider a real summing circuit; let's begin with the simpler ''op-amp non-inverting summer'' (Fig. 12).

Here, there are already some resistances connected to the op-amp inputs; we have only to equalize them, in order to minimize the input bias current error:

&lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;e(+)&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt;,   R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Now, if we substitute the term R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) with K (the gain of the op-amp non-inverting amplifier) and α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.K = G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, we will get again Plato's formula for the non-inverting summer:

&lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/K = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio between the voltage at the non-inverting input and the input voltage while G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio between the op-amp output voltage and the input voltage).

Note that the &quot;ground&quot; resistor R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is a vital element in this circuit!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Op-amp mixed summer ===

Finally, let's see, if the ''universal summing-subtracting circuit'' obeys Plato's formula. Again, we equalize the input equivalent resistances, in order to minimize the input bias current error:

&lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;e(+)&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;e(-)&lt;/sub&gt;,   R&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;i3&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

After we substitute the terms as above, we will see that really the most complex summing circuit obeys Plato's formula: R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/K.


[[Image:Simple_design_mix_sum_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13a. Op-amp mixed summer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Simple_design_mix_sum2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13b. Op-amp mixed summer (a continuation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Plato's formula illusions ===

Note that Plato's formula cherishes the illusion that calculating the non-inverting gains is as simple as inverting ones and the non-inverting gains are independent. Only, if we consider the case when we have defined the gains but later we have to change some of them, we will establish the fact that after we have recalculated the input resistor we have to recalculate the ground gain (Daisy) and ground resistor (Plato).

Plato - There is no illusion in K9. Whenever you change a gain,you need to calculate two new resistor values namely the input resistor and the ground resistor.  The only difference between inverting and non-inverting gains is the op-amp input that they connect to. In mixed gain circuits, a gain change may move the ground resistor connection. Daisy tells you where to connect.
Legacy analysis can only handle negative gain changes and only if you don't need a balanced circuit.
Legacy promotes the illusion that positive and mixed gains are difficult. Doesn't have to be.
The K9 procedure is not only simpler, but better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few ways to get Ubuntu on your system, some take more commitment than others.

==Live Disk==

When you have your Ubuntu CD it is possible to boot your computer directly from it. Your computer system will remain completly unaffected, allowing you to sample Ubuntu without actually installing it. Booting from a live disk is only really used to try Ubuntu out, as when you switch off, all settings are lost.
[[Using Ubuntu Linux/Live Boot]]

==Virtual Machine==

To run a fully fledged operating system you don't even need to boot up from it; using a virtual machine it is posible to start Ubuntu (or most other operating systems for that matter) inside Windows, this method has it's advantages over Live Disk in that it is more perminent, it's like actually having the operating system. So if you liked the live disk and wanted to try it out further, this would be the option.
[[Using Ubuntu Linux/Virtualization]]

==Dual Boot==

Now we're getting more serious. So you want to install Ubuntu, but you don't want to lose Windows, it's easy enough setting up a dual boot system, where windows is sitting on one part of your hard drive and Ubuntu on the other. You can only boot one at a time, but you can still keep Windows there if you don't want to take the full leap. The big disadvantage of dual booting is that it (most of the time) requires you to format your hard drive, wiping your existing Windows installation.
[[Using Ubuntu Linux/Installing]]

==Complete Microsoft Takedown==

That's it, you're fed up with Windows and want it out of your life, then so be it! This process involves installing Linux Ubuntu completely on your hard drive.

'''Mortadella''' is a large Italian sausage (salume) made of finely hashed/ground heat-cured pork sausage which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig). It is flavoured with spices which include black pepper (whole corns or ground), myrtle berries, nutmeg, coriander and typically pieces of pistachio nuts. Traditionally the pork filling was ground to a paste using a pestle and large mortar (mortaio).  A similar commercial product, called &quot;bologna&quot;, &quot;bologna sausage&quot; or &quot;baloney&quot;, and often omitting the cubes of pork fat, is popular in the United States. It is also known as &quot;polony&quot; in the United Kingdom and some countries in the Commonwealth of Nations.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] sets up the protective spells. She wanted the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] to see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] so they would know that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] had not lied, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] was hidden because he is supposed to be confined at home with Spattergroit; if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] is a captive due to Xeno's actions, then the Weasley family would be in peril if Death Eaters knew Ron was with Harry. Her own parents are safe in Australia, their memories modified.

Hermione complains that visiting Xeno Lovegood was a waste and discounts the Three Brothers fairy tale. But Harry is drawn to it&amp;mdash;being able to conquer death and not be killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] fuels his imagination, giving him hope. Ron agrees with Harry that Xeno fabricating such a story while under intense pressure, trying to detain Harry, would be difficult. Ron also recaps Hermione's significant evidence supporting the Elder Wand's existence. Harry counters Hermione's claim that the dead can never be resurrected; his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] emerged from Voldemort's wand. Seeing Hermione's and Ron's wary expressions when he mentions resurrecting the dead, he changes the subject to the Peverells. They are among the oldest Wizarding families recorded, and though the male line bearing the name died out long ago, Hermione says there could be female descendants. Harry suddenly recalls [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|You-know-who]]'s grandfather, showing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|representative]] a ring bearing the Peverell symbol to prove their ancestry. Harry believes the ring, having the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] symbol scratched on it, contains the Resurrection Stone. He also remembers that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] had borrowed his father James' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], and deduces that Dumbledore believed it was a Hallow. Recalling the Three Brothers' tale, Harry wonders if the person who holds the three Hallows' can master Death, and will it come down to him against Voldemort? Hallows against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]? He also guesses that Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|left him the Snitch]] because the Resurrection Stone is inside.

Harry is convinced that Voldemort is seeking the Elder Wand to defeat Harry and destroy Harry's wand. Hermione, however, thinks Ron and Harry are making a fairy tale into reality; Harry should only follow Dumbledore's clear instructions to destroy Horcruxes. Over the next week, however, Harry becomes obsessed with the Deathly Hallows. He is certain the Resurrection Stone is somehow hidden inside the Snitch, but he is still unable to open it or understand its cryptic inscription, &quot;I open at the close.&quot; Ron and Hermione urge Harry to instead concentrate on the Horcruxes rather than the Deathly Hallows. 

Ron gradually takes charge of the mission, suggesting new places to search. One night in March, he is finally able to tune in the wireless to &quot;Potterwatch&quot;, the radio show he has been looking for since Christmas. Produced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], &quot;Potterwatch&quot; is the only wireless program that reports the truth; everyone else toes the new Ministry line. Tonight, Lee reports that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]], and the Goblin, Gornuk, have been killed. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and a second Goblin are believed to have escaped. Lee also mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] is dead. Following Lee's report, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] speaks about Muggle casualties, and issues a plea to assist them against Death Eater depredations. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] then explains why he is certain Harry is alive. Following this, there is an opinion piece by either [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred or George]] about how &quot;You-know-who&quot; cannot be everywhere he is reported, as there would have to be about nineteen of him. Finally, Lee Jordan closes with a plea for calm.

After the show, Harry accidentally speaks Voldemort’s name, collapsing the protective enchantments around the tent. Snatchers immediately surround them.

== Analysis ==

Harry's reactions to the Deathly Hallows are seen here. The possibility that his parents could be resurrected tantalizes Harry, as well as the protection the Hallows might afford him against death. Harry's focus on the Hallows forms the backdrop to Ron's largely taking charge. Harry has been left confused and rudderless, first by Dumbledore's leaving him without guidance, and second by his distraction over the Hallows; Ron steps into this leadership void, undergoing a significant change as he does. No longer a passive and insecure follower, his guilt over his brief desertion, as well as Hermione's severe chastisement, have propelled him into a becoming a more mature, confident, and proactive young man who assumes responsibility in guiding the others, relieving Harry and Hermione from many day-to-day burdens. Though Harry will once again assume the mission's leadership role, from here on, Ron never again dwells contentedly in others' shadows, and begins charting his own life's course.

The wireless (radio) once again comes into focus after Ron successfully tunes in ''Potterwatch'', the one program reporting the truth about Harry, Voldemort, and the ongoing war. During conflicts, communication like this becomes extremely important in disseminating truthful information amidst overwhelming propaganda that is usually being spread, while it also helps rally and unify allies. Although Harry only hears the program once before capture, he is comforted and feels reconnected to old friends, uniting them in the fight against Voldemort. It also bolsters Harry's morale, allowing him to fully realize that this is not his battle alone.   

Another interesting plot point is highlighted. The Trio agrees that Harry's Invisibility Cloak could actually be the one from ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'', which Xenophilius claims may have been the Peverells. The youngest brother bequeathed the Cloak to his son. Considering Harry received the Cloak from his father, it is possible that it was handed down to him through the generations, making him a direct Peverell descendant. Harry and Voldemort could share a common Peverell ancestor, not that blood ties account for much anymore as Wizarding families are ripped apart by Voldemort's war. As seen in Sirius Black's family, close relatives, divided by their blood-purity beliefs and loyalties to Voldemort, will readily disown and even kill one another.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===

#Why is Harry so interested in the Deathly Hallows? Why do Ron and Hermione think he should only concentrate on hunting Horcruxes? 
#How and why does Ron take charge of the mission?
#Was the visit to the Lovegoods a waste as Hermione claims? If not, why?
#How does listening to ''Potterwatch'' affect the Trio?

=== Further Study ===

#Knowing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]] exist, why would Hermione be so skeptical about the Resurrection Stone?
#What might the inscription on the Snitch that Harry still carries, &quot;I open at the close&quot;, mean?
#Why might Dumbledore have wanted Harry to know about the three Hallows?

== Greater Picture ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although Hermione believes the Lovegood visit revealed nothing important and she discounts The Three Brothers tale, like the trip to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], information has been provided that the Trio has yet to realize is important to their mission. The Deathly Hallows will be tied to defeating Voldemort, although Harry's initial interest in them is unrelated. To someone who has lost many loved ones, a Resurrection Stone is a particularly desirable and seductive object to possess, and Harry reconsiders that magic could reunite him with his parents. And while Hermione wants to stick with Dumbledore's plan to only search for Horcruxes, Harry's continuing fascination with the Hallows and his hope to be reunited with his parents will eventually help him work out their significance. Meanwhile, the revelations about Dumbledore's past still trouble Harry, and his faith and trust in his Headmaster continues to waver. Harry also doubts whether Dumbledore ever really cared for him and wonders if he is merely a pawn in Dumbledore's scheme to defeat Voldemort. These doubts will linger, to a greater or lesser extent, until Harry speaks with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|Dumbledore's shade]] in a later chapter. 

As Dumbledore's shade admits later to having expected, Harry becomes infatuated, as did the youthful Dumbledore, with the Hallows. Like Dumbledore, Harry sees them as a means to regain his lost family; additionally, he believes them to be a safeguard against Voldemort's expected murderous attack. The Hallows' attraction remains strong until after Harry escapes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. Following that, Harry will choose to only seek and destroy Horcruxes, though that decision will torment him, particularly after he learns that Voldemort has claimed the Elder Wand.

As noted, Ron is now leading the mission, as Harry, infatuated with the Hallows, endlessly debates whether to search for the remaining one, or to continue hunting Horcruxes. When Harry overcomes his fixation and returns to himself in Malfoy Manor, Ron once again drops to the sidelines. However, we will see that he has gained a certain capacity for independent action that was previously lacking. This will be evident particularly after the Trio return to Hogwarts, where Ron, accompanied by Hermione, takes it upon himself to re-enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] to retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk fangs]] to destroy the Cup Horcrux.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

The next morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] remain distant, though Ron is quite cheery when he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] are alone. Their recent upswing in luck, with Ron's return, recovering the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], and destroying the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], has created a more optimistic mood. Each updates the other about recent events, and Ron reveals that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] name is jinxed to trace anyone speaking it and to break protective spells. That is how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] found them so quickly in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|Tottenham Court Road]]. They speculate about who conjured the doe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], and discuss Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald's]] close friendship. 

Ron mentions a radio program, ''Potterwatch'', that reports accurate news. A password is needed to tune it in, and Ron missed the last show. Hermione suggests visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]]. Dumbledore's letter to Grindelwald, reproduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Life and Lies|Rita Skeeter's book]], contains the same symbol that Mr. Lovegood [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|was wearing]], that is inked in ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'', and is engraved on the Peverell tombstone. Harry is reluctant after their recent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] misadventure, but Hermione insists these connections are important. Ron sides with Hermione, noting that Xenophilius has lately been publishing pro-Harry articles in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']], though Harry suspects Ron is only trying to regain Hermione's favor. 

The next morning the Trio [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparate]] to Ottery St. Catchpole, a village near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] and close to the Lovegoods ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 6|who were first mentioned in book 4]]). After walking a bit, a strange-looking cylindrical house appears, and three hand-painted signs indicate that the editor of ''The Quibbler'' resides there. Odd plants and creatures that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] has either worn or mentioned line the path. An unkempt-looking Xenophilius Lovegood answers the door and only reluctantly invites the Trio in. Inside, Xeno, appearing anxious, quickly covers his printing press and resists Ron's and Hermione's requests to help Harry, despite having urged his readers to do so. Asked about Luna, Xeno claims she is fishing at the stream. Harry notices a stone statue of a woman wearing a bizarre-looking headdress. Xeno explains that the statue is modeled after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]] wearing her now-lost Diadem. Harry asks about the symbol Xeno wore to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur's]] wedding. Xenophilius indicates that it is the sign of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]].

== Analysis ==

Several non-human elements play a critical role in this chapter in addition to human ones. This is the first time an identifiable Ravenclaw artifact has been mentioned. While some fans speculated that the wand in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander's]] shop window may have been Ravenclaw's, this is the first time that any specific object has been positively connected with her. Knowing that we are looking for artifacts the four Hogwarts Founders once owned, attention should probably be paid to Ravenclaw having had a diadem that people have been searching for. (A [[:commons:Category:Diadems|diadem]]&lt;!-- [[w:Diadem (personal wear)]] --&gt; is a jeweled ornament in the shape of a half crown, worn by women and placed over the forehead, also called a ''tiara''.)

Also, the radio, or wireless as it is also known, is important because it demonstrates that there are ongoing underground channels to provide truthful information about Harry Potter, Voldemort, and the war. Like Xenophilius Lovegood's stories in ''The Quibbler'', the ''Potterwatch'' wireless program helps to inform and rally the wizarding community by airing accurate news and updates. By acting as a unified voice, it creates solidarity among wizards and encourages its listeners, who have either been too fearful or uninformed, to resist the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters. These broadcasts are similar to how radio maintained communication with populations suppressed by war and, later, communism in the mid-20th century. It also shows the powerful effect the media can exert over the masses; whether this power is used for good or evil depends on who controls it and how and what is disseminated. If Ron can tune in the &quot;Potterwatch&quot; program, it should become an essential tool, not only for providing the Trio current information about Voldemort, their allies, and the war, but to help Harry reconnect ties to old friends and align himself with others who are fighting a common cause. Radio reports about who has been killed or captured can also act as a reminder to Harry that Voldemort's reign of terror affects many others, not only him.

Most importantly, the strange symbol the Trio has repeatedly encountered is identified by Xenophilius as the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, though their significance is still a mystery. Also, Xeno's disheveled appearance and odd behavior are certainly suspect, especially considering his staunch pro-Harry Potter support in his newspaper. Xeno Lovegood's strange demeanor strongly indicates something may be amiss here, especially when he agrees to assist the Trio only after they pressure him. Luna's absence seems peculiar, too, and Xeno's claim that she is catching fish for their supper also seems suspicious; the Trio soon become wary.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
#Why does the trio seek out Xenophilius Lovegood? How can he help them?
#Where is Luna?
#Why did Viktor Krum and others believe the Deathly Hallows symbol represented Dark Magic, when apparently it did not?
#What is the sign of the Deathly Hallows?

=== Further Study ===
#Why would Xenophilius have a statue modeled after Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her headdress? Could this be significant to Harry's mission? If so, why?
#How is the radio used in the fight against Voldemort? How could it be used against Harry?
#Why does Xenophilius, an ardent Harry Potter supporter, seem reluctant to help the Trio?
#Why would Xeno suddenly cover the printing press?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Trio will learn, at last, that the symbol refers to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|''Deathly Hallows'']], and it is not a Dark mark as Viktor Krum mistakenly claimed, though it was co-opted by Grindelwald much as the swastika was by Hitler in the Muggle world during the same time period. However, it will take Harry some time to work out just what the Hallows are, whether or not they relate directly to his mission, or whether Dumbledore intended for him to pursue them separately. Eventually it will be learned that Dumbledore did intend for Harry and the Trio to discover the Hallows, especially the Elder Wand, but rather than revealing their existence, he instead chose for the Trio to discover the Hallows gradually to avoid them falling into the same trap he had. Dumbledore feared that, on learning the Hallows myth and their supposed power over death, Harry would abandon his search for Horcruxes, and instead become obsessed with the idea of resurrecting his lost parents. In fact that very nearly happens.

Harry seeing the model of Rowena Ravenclaw's lost Diadem is crucial because this is the first time that a known Ravenclaw artifact that may have survived to the present is mentioned. Later, Harry discovers that Voldemort made the true Ravenclaw Diadem into a Horcrux. Harry has unknowingly come into contact with the Diadem. While searching for a place to hide his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] book inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], he used the Diadem as a marker to remember the book's location. However, Harry obviously was unaware that he was handling one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.

Xenophilius' odd behavior is also important to note, for in the next chapter we learn that when the Trio arrived at his house, he immediately dispatched an owl to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] alerting them. The careful reader will note the owl in the garden as the Trio approach the house, and it flying up past the window as Harry looks out when Xeno says he is going to fetch Luna; those who recognize this later may assume, as Harry apparently did, that the owl was being sent to fetch Luna. We soon learn that Xeno informs the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] only because Luna has been taken captive by Death Eaters, and Xeno is hoping that by informing on Harry, he can secure her release.</text>

'''Spirits''' is a term used in Food and Wine nomenclature to denote a '''distilled beverage'''. It is a liquid preparation meant for consumption containing ethyl alcohol (ethanol) purified by distillation from a fermented substance such as fruit, vegetables, or grain. The word ''spirits'' generally refers to distilled beverages low in sugars and containing at least 35% alcohol by volume. Brandy, eau de vie, gin, rum, schnapps, tequila, vodka and whisky are types of spirits. Distilled beverages with added flavorings and a relatively high sugar content such as Grand Marnier, Frangelico and American style schnapps are generally referred to as liqueurs. The term ''liquor'' may mean spirits; spirits and liqueurs; or all alcoholic beverages, including [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]], sake, beer and mead.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definitions and Introduction ==
As we mentioned before, the piano illustrates the basis for musical theory. This chapter discusses intervals in theory and shows the relationships between them. It also will give you a better understanding of how  intervals can be used to derive remaining parts of chords you don't know. We will further discuss chords in a different section, but this will be a basic introduction in chord building, and will show you how you can accompany different songs while you play melodies with your right hand. In this section, things might begin to get really, really confusing, especially if you don't have any kind of previous music theory knowledge. Take your time, relax, and if any questions or ideas for improvements to this chapter arise just leave comments on the talk page. I will do my best to explain the concepts to you. It might be a good idea if you have already familiarized yourself with the scales, as i will be using them extensively during this chapter.

=== So, what are intervals? ===
An interval can be briefly described as the distance between two notes. For example, in the C major (Ionian) scale, the first and third finger when pressed at the same time form an interval (a major third). Note that notes in intervals can be separate and in order: ascending (c, e) and descending (e, c), or simultaneous (both notes played at the same time). Also note that intervals are characterized by the grades of the scale, taking each note of a scale and assigning it a number. Intervals are the basis to form chords.

== Key Concepts ==

=== Counting Notes ===

When calculating the distance between two notes, you must be really careful and count the semitones, which, on the piano, means both white and black keys. For example, after c comes c#, then d, then d#, etc. On the piano, the black keys represent semitones that are ignored (not played) when making a third major interval on the c scale. You can play the entire C major scale on just the white keys.

== Types of Intervals ==

=== Second and Third Intervals ===

The reason why these intervals are together in this section is because their theoretical explanation is exactly the same, and they work in the same way; the 4th, 5th and 8th intervals work differently. 

==== Method for Counting Notes ====

Play a C and an E. If there are exactly 3 notes (3 black and white keys), without counting the initial and last note, in between them, the interval is called a third major. If there are two notes in between, the interval is called a third minor. The same concept applies to second minor and major. A second minor in the C scale is C and C# (no semitones are separating the notes). These second intervals, which, as seen later on, are used for improvisation techniques, are usually played separately and often quickly, and are repeated in ascending order. This method works only for second and third intervals from any given key. Note: Play these notes always in ascending order. The reason for this is that intervals change depending on the order sometimes. This will be discussed further on this chapter.

==== Alternative Methods ====

Although the method for counting notes described above starts to become really ineffective especially on greater intervals, many musicians prefer to sing the notes of the scale with numbers from 1 to 8 to identify the kind of interval that is played simultaneously by ear. If you count up to 3 notes for example, (C to E) the interval is quickly identified as a third major. If we approach a different method and lower the third note of the major scale (from E to Eb, or D#) the interval is minor. This is mainly why you need to know the major and minor scales by heart in order to play or identify given intervals. Scale recognition by ear is heavily based on the intervals that you hear, depending on the scales. I will be using this method for better clarity and understanding.

=== 6th and 7th Intervals ===

Taking of course the 1st and 6th grades of the A major scale, we can say that A and F# is a 6th interval. If we lower the F# to an F, it becomes a 6th minor. Same applies to the seventh interval: Taking the 1st and 6th grades of the D major scale, we can lower the C# and make the 7th interval a minor one.

=== 4th and 5th Intervals ===

Taking the 1st grades of the F major scale, we can have a 5th interval by playing F and C. This is denominated as a perfect 5th. If C is lowered to B, the interval is known as a diminished 5th or tritone; if C is shifted to C#, the interval is known as an augmented 5th. If we take the 1st and 4th grades of the G major scale, we would obtain a perfect 4th interval once G and C are played. Shifting C to C# would result in an augmented 4th; lowering C to B would result in a diminished 4th.

=== Octaves ===

Octaves are also said to be perfect or fixed, because the same note is played at a higher octave. The simultaneous playing of an octave is known as a doubled note. Play the middle C on the piano keyboard, then play the next C that you find either to the right or left of the middle C. Notice how the note sounds the same, or has the same feeling, but it sounds higher. Well, that is because it's the same note, just an octave above (to the right) or below (to the left).

== Relationships Between Intervals ==

Although it is not really necessary to review this, it helps to clear and avoid any confusion you might have. Remember the perfect 4th interval we had mentioned before? Well, you can find out that if we lower the C and play the notes G and B, we obtain a third major interval. Same when shifting the note: We obtain an augmented 4th interval or a diminished 5th interval. For the 2nd and 3rd interval relationships, a 3rd minor interval is also an augmented 2nd interval, and a 2nd major interval is a diminished third interval. This relationship also works with 6th and 7th intervals, and even with octaves, if you stop and think about. Now that we have discussed the intervals at length, let's make some decisions here.

== Determining the Kinds of Intervals ==

We have so far discussed what the types of intervals are and how to identify them. This section deals with when you don't know whether to name an interval perfect, diminished and augmented or major and minor. Just keep this in mind: When the same higher note is played an octave above and that note forms a 4th or 5th interval, the interval is denominated as perfect. So, if we take C and F, but we play the F note an octave higher, we get a perfect 11th interval. You can expand this all the way to even a 22nd or a 23rd interval, though only in really strange cases do intervals get this big, so there is usually no need to identify intervals that are higher than an octave or so. (An exception is montuno patterns. Montuno is a completely different style that deals with chord inversions played differently on each hand; therefore, this topic is not relevant to a discussion of intervals.)

== Introduction to the Formation of Chords ==

Hopefully you feel alright with we have discussed so far and understand most of the relationships between intervals. it is not really required that you so, but it would really help when you get to chord inversions and any other types of identification. Although this has really been based on musical theory, learning to play piano without music theory is like learning how to speak a language without proper grammar and syntax concepts. You also hopefully might have been playing and discovering some different intervals than the ones I already mentioned here. now, lets go to the construction of chords by using intervals.

=== Brief Explanation of Chords ===

A chord is 3 or more notes played together. If the notes are played separately, the &quot;broken&quot; chord is called an arpeggio. It is a good technical exercise and also a good improvisation technique if you manage to play arpeggios quickly. Chords are the basis or core for the accompaniment of all songs and are used differently into many styles.  If we base the formation of chords into intervals we can say that a chord consists of two intervals being put together, as shown in the next section.

=== Major Chords ===

The reason why this is called a major chord is because of the first major interval as you will notice. Most chords are named after the first interval that you play. For the sake of making things easy to comprehend and play I base this type of chords on the c scale and put the notation of the fingers which are used after the note. So if we would play d with the index finger the notation used will be d2. I assume you are playing these chords with your right hand. if you wish to do so with the left hand, simply reverse the order of the fingers you use on your right hand. This is why piano builds a lot of coordination. Lets begin with a third major interval (c1 e3). Now that we have such kind of interval, we can add a minor second interval above by playing with the pinky the note g, thus making the interval with notes e g. First play it as an arpeggio and then play all the notes at the same time. If you know other scales, do the same and don't be afraid to experiment. Form a major third interval and then add an augmented second above the higher note of the third major interval.

=== Minor Chords ===

As you would have guessed, the minor third interval begins the chord (c1 eb3), then adding the g again, in which we get a third minor and then a third major. Notice how the order to intervals reverse. Major chord: Major third interval, minor third on top. Minor chord--minor first, followed by third major.

== Conclusion and Tips ==

Although this might seem really overwhelming at first, this uses the basis of interval and shows their importance into chord forming. it is good that you keep on experimenting and see what kind of intervals form which kind of chords. It is much better to discover the syntax of a language or learn the vocabulary with a dictionary of the same language rather than remind yourself of the equivalent word in your first language. In other words, using intervals on this manner will really help you see relationships between minor and major , chord inversions and figuring them out rather than try to remember the notes that compose them constantly. This will also make you a better pianist and a better musician. Explore, practice and put dedication into it. Once you practice chords there will be the need to no longer remember the chord's composition by using intervals. Piano can be as easy and as hard as you want it to be. IN the next chapters we will be discussing more chords and their intervals. Finally, we will focus on stylistic patterns used in many different rhythms. What makes piano really complex to introduce and teach fully most of the time is that the diversity is really great as far as the styles you can play and relations in music theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Central to the practice of orthopaedic surgery is the idea that painful and poorly functioning joints are surgically treatable entities.  In the past century, surgeons have attempted to replace the surfaces of joints to relieve pain and preserve function.  The replacement of joint surfaces with artificial or alternative surfaces is called arthroplasty.  

Arthroplasty can be performed successfully using a variety of substances including autogenous tissue.  Typically, joint surfaces are exposed and the diseased joint is removed to provide a surface capable of accepting the arthroplasty material.  One common result of this is that arthroplasty surgery is rarely a trivial affair as entire exposure of and replacement of the joint is a standard goal.  

The standard elements of joint arthroplasty will be discussed.  It should be noted that there is a common trend in both literature and practice to refer to arthroplasty as &quot;adult reconstructive&quot; surgery.  This owes to the fact that the majority of arthroplasties are performed in patients suffering  from osteoarthrosis which is a degradative process common in the joints of the elderly.  Osteoarthrosis itself is most commonly referred to as &quot;osteoarthritis&quot; which signifies a wear-and-tear process in a joint.  Although the term adult reconstruction is commonly used, it can be a type of misnomer because it suggests osteoarthrosis as the disease for which arthroplasty is the cure.  On the contrary, arthroplasty is a surgical solution for many types of destructive joint disorders including the inflammatory arthropathies and neuroarthropathy.  

With these concepts in mind, a discussion of the elements of arthroplasty can begin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}
==Ingredients==
* ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon achiote (annatto) seeds
* 1 cup Sofrito (recipe below)
* 3 tablespoons of Alcaparrado (manzanilla olives, pimientos and capers) or coarsely chopped pimiento manzanilla and stuffed olives 
* 3 tablespoons of salt 
* 1 tablespoon of fresh cracked black pepper
* 2 teaspoons of cumin seeds 
* 1½ pounds smoked pork, turkey, or ham, skin removed and chopped 
* 6 cups of long grain rice (do not rinse).
* A 13 ounce bag of frozen pigeon peas or a 15 ounce can of pigeon peas drained and rinsed 
* Beef, chicken, turkey or vegetable broth. Home made is best but you can use store bought or water (about 7½ cups)
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 banana leaf or plantain leaf (optional)

For the Sofrito
* 2 medium Spanish onions, cut into large chunks
* 3 to 4 Italian frying peppers or cubanelle peppers
* 16 to 20 cloves garlic, peeled 
* 1 large bunch cilantro, washed 
* 7 to 10 ajices dulces (sweet chili peppers), optional 
* 4 leaves of culantro (recao), or another handful of cilantro 
* 3 to 4 ripe plum tomatoes, seeded, cored and cut into chunks 
* 1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into large chunks

==Procedure==

# Chop the onion and cubanelle or Italian peppers in the work bowl of a food processor until coarsely chopped. 
#With the motor running, add the remaining ingredients one at a time and process until smooth. Remove ½ cup of sofrito for rice. The sofrito will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze in ice trays and it will last a month. 
# Heat the oil and annatto seeds in a small skillet over medium heat just until the seeds give off a lively, steady sizzle. Don't overheat the mixture or the seeds will turn black and the oil a nasty green. Once they're sizzling away, pull the pan from the heat and let stand until the sizzling stops. Strain as much of the oil as you can into a heavy 5-quart pot or Dutch and let it stand for at least 5 minutes.  
# Lightly toast the cumin seeds in a small skillet over low heat for a few minutes before grinding them releases flavor and aroma. Keep an eye on them, they turn dark fast. Grind in a little spice grinder or coffee mill.
# If using frozen pigeon peas boil for 10 minutes before using. 
# Re-heat oil over high heat until rippling. Stir in pork and brown. Add sofrito, alcaparrado, salt, bay leaves, cumin, &amp; pepper. Cook until sofrito stops boiling and sizzles, about 5 minutes. 
# Stir in the rice and peas until everything is mixed together and rice is coated with oil all over. Stir in enough broth or water to cover the rice by the width of two fingers. Top with banana leaf (or pan lid), folding it up as necessary to fit over rice or can cut what ever sticks out pot. Bring to a boil &amp; boil without stirring until the level of liquid meets the rice. Remove the banana leaf, give the rice a big stir, and put leaf back on top. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with lid, and cook until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. About 20 minutes.</text>

Hi - I've looed at your comment but I am afraid I am not sure what it is that you require?  It may be best if you pots something [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|here]] where more people will see it.  I have changed the page you blanked back to a redirect as it may be easier for people to find the new location for now.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:33, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

:Again I am unsure exactly what you are trying to do.  Equally my editing is patchy at present so you really would be best asking [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|here]] or the link above - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:54, 29 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Shimano images ==

G'day, and thanks for uploading those images on Shimano gearing. I've just copied them across to the Wiki Commons, so that they can be used by other Wiki projects (including non-English Wikibooks). You might be interested in some of the other images on Commons, especially for the Bicycles book. For example, take a look at [[commons:Category:Shimano]] and [[commons:Category:Derailleur gears]]. You can use any of these images as if they were in Wikibooks, with no special notation - when the Wiki software doesn't find them locally, it pulls them down from the Commons. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:54, 8 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Type Casting ==
There are various kinds of casts in C++: C-style casts like (type)value, functional-style casts like type(value), and keyword casts (reinterpret_cast, const_cast, static_cast, dynamic_cast).  That's all the casts there are.  Some conversions are caused by casts, some are not.  There's no such thing as an &quot;automatic cast&quot;.
----
[moved from [[Talk:C++ Programming/Type Casting]]]--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
----
I've now explained to [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] the presumable author of the post that, type casting and type conversion are synonyms, to say that there is no such thing as  &quot;automatic cast&quot; is the same as &quot;automatic type conversion&quot; (which there is).
&quot;automatic type conversion&quot; is the conversion of one type to another without an instruction from the coder, like by using some construct or an abstraction layer one can perform an &quot;automatic type conversion&quot;. (must check the text if this is explained there) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:01, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
----
At this time I think I've helped Panic to understand that type conversion and type casting are '''not''' synonyms, and explained in particular how some type casts do not result in conversions, while other conversions occur without casts being present. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 07:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
----
This discussion is more or less finished [[User:James Dennett]] has corrected my assertion. It is still here and  not archived because a check must be made if the correct information is now on the book, before archiving this... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:43, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

The example of dynamic_cast on this page is flawed at the moment in that neither of those classes are polymorphic.

== pointers ==
(moved from the Q&amp;A page as an unsigned post about content) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

I would like to have a bit more of how pointers work and what their function(s) are.Also i would like to know what Data Structure can be used to write a function that returns an Array of elements.Your help will be highly appreciated.

: The answer to (a) is (b). The answer to (b) is (a).

A bit less snarky: Pointers do many things. We use pointers to implement most forms of indirection; and ''&quot;All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection&quot;'' according to [[wikipedia: abstraction layer]] :-). One way to return an array of elements involves a pointer to (the first element of) that array.

Today I added an example of passing arrays to a function and returning an array from a function at [[C++ Programming/STL]].
I have one example using the older &quot;C style arrays&quot;, the other example uses the newer &quot;C++ STL vectors&quot;.
Does this answer your question?
Would it be more useful to move that example to
[[C++ Programming/Operators/Arrays]] or perhaps [[C++ Programming/Memory Management]] ?

== Inheritance, Polymorphism ==
Can anyone explain why there need to be two different modules on inheritance and two different modules on polymorphism in this book? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:Results of the restructuring of Darklama. Darklama advanced the concept of named structure to support even better the page names navigation scheme, specific sections were aggregated (see class / stl /api ), works ok and was an improvement to the navigation. The specific pages were restructured not only to accommodate to that but also due to the extensive changes of the text and order. I'm saving the original pages to state only the concept and class/xpto to the applications of it (like a page to state what is a plug and another to show how to install a plug on a wall), and as it seems there is duplication with the page Darklama created merging other 3 pages (the one with history logs problems), but that one will require very careful work to see what was done there.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

I would prefer to have only one section which starts from basic and advances gradually. Wish we could come up with a bible kind of book. 
[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:That was how it was structured in the beginning of the book (on the introduction to programming paradigms) but that information was reduced (some of the historic part was removed) and there is a problem for a single part that addresses it all, that is a bit difficult as several concepts have a general definition but implications in several parts of the language, take a look for instance on the Editor's ToC at the memory management and see if you can merge it properly with the book (it's a hard task to make the book not only usable to for people that only will use it for consultation and people that like to read a book from cover to cover), I personalty prefer the first concept for technical books but I have not imposed that view on my edits if you have a better solution give it a try with that page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:55, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

What I would suggest is to add a chapter before inheritance with title resource management. There we have to discuss everything related to object creation including the usage of placement new, delete[], auto pointers , smart pointers etc.  Before knowing OOPS a person should know memory management in C++. Then only he will be able to understand properly virtual functions, multiple inheritance with a common ancestor etc...  Also I would say add one error management in C++ before we dive into OOPS. Once these are done, discuss inheritance. At this point a reader will be able to understand descent code which contains memory management and exception handling code. We also will be able to throw good examples of inheritance. Then move to generics/templates. 
Regarding the Editor's ToC at procedural idioms, it contanins boost specific examples. I would prefer to take out boost specif things to the beyond the basics section of TOC 2. There an exhaustive boost chapter is welcome. After all we don't have a company like SUN who will provide JDK like API. So we should encourage all third party tools usage and anybody interested let them add one chater about usge of a specific tool there.

== RTTI ==
&lt;small&gt;''This conversation moved from [[Talk:C++ Programming/RTTI]].''&lt;/small&gt;

This discussion is not so much about the page or the content itself but about RTTI; in particular its misuses of it and comparing it to goto.  If you are going to compare it to goto you might as well say never ever use it.  A page here http://www.asingh.net/technical/rtti.html talks about up-casting a pointer back to a derived pointer : perhaps to access specific methods of that object ... wouldn't this be a valid use of RTTI ? at some point (because all objects aren't the same) you will have to access a object specific member right ... ? even if those classes are in a hierarchy.  --[[User:Gravisan|Gravisan]] 04:18, 11 September 2007 (UTC)
----
To tell you the truth I never used RTTI intentionally, and you must keep in mind that the book isn't only written by a single person (you may edit any information you object to). I will check the edit and see if something is inaccurate and who provided the content.
As for stating &quot;never ever use it&quot; we don't do this here :) we try to substitute must by should in general. Even in the goto information we only provide the facts, we don't specify that it should never be used (there are proper, even if rare, cases for its use).&lt;br&gt;
I will examine the provided information and will reply to you later (and add/correct any content) on this subject.&lt;br&gt;
Txs for the input.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:35, 12 September 2007 (UTC)
----
''But suppose that we know'' for sure ''that this pointer points to an object of type 'SpecificClass' and we would like to call the member SpecificOp() of that class. To dynamically convert to a derived type we can use dynamic_cast, like so:''

If we know this ''for sure'', there's no need to use dynamic_cast.  The whole point of dynamic_cast is that it can be used when the object's dynamic type is unknown, and the results will indicate whether it has the correct type.  Also, type_info::name() does not in general return the class name as shown, but returns a compiler-dependent string.  I hate to dump on other people's efforts, but it is better to have nothing than something incorrect.

: {{done}}. I changed the text of [[C++ Programming/RTTI]] as you suggested. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:15, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

::Sorry I reedited it and made it worst the original was the most correct one (any of the view points can be valid) even if I don't know any useful instance when throw an exception would be wanted. I'll get back on this, going to do some research.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:33, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

::The situation/examples are weak for the intended demonstration as there was no previous contextualization. I've added a bit on top and reworded it to conform to the above. See if you agree, I think that there is some content duplication occurring here will check on that...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:50, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

::Ok removed duplication and some misleading information, still to do is a interconnection of dynamic_cast, the other casts, types, exceptions and RTTI.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:19, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

== Chapter names ==
I propose a change to the chapter names:
Renaming chapter &quot;Getting Started&quot; as &quot;C++ a multi-paradigm language&quot; and &quot;Fundamentals&quot; as &quot;Getting Started&quot; for starters would resolve most of the issue people have raised and relate better to the content provided there.
&quot;Advanced Features&quot; is also a problematic issue but I haven't come up with a viable alternative, something like &quot;Extended Features&quot; would be an advance does anyone have a better idea ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:29, 22 March 2010 (UTC)
:Done. I've also taken the chance to improve the navigation and clear some of the book's category chaos. The second chapter is still pending moves and renames. Now a change is also in order to the &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot; since it is a to generic chapter title, something on the lines of &quot;Using the power of object-oriented constructs and features&quot;.
:I also detected inconsistency on the headings case and page names I will attempt to fix it. Page names will have the first letter upper cased (if possible, for instance keywords shouldn't be changed)... 
:Objection and ideas for improving the title are welcomed  to facilitate later changes on the chapter name I was thinking in reducing the page name to &quot;Objects&quot; (like the first chapter uses &quot;C++&quot;).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:13, 8 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

In addition to its internally defined spherical objects, Celestia can use 3D models to display bodies with complicated shapes.

==Usage in Celestia==

A 3D model will be displayed when Celestia encounters the '''Mesh''' directive in one of its [[Celestia/Catalog_File_Reference|catalog files]]. For example,
 Mesh &quot;file.3ds&quot;

If a '''Texture''' declaration is included in the entry for the same object, that texture image will replace all diffuse material texture images specified in the model file.

==Model Types==

Celestia can display three different types of 3D model files.

===3DS===

Originally developed by the authors of 3D Studio Max, the .3DS binary file format is used by many different software packages. Model files usually can be created in this format by choosing it in the &quot;Export&quot; menu of your favorite 3D modeling program.

===CMS===

[[Celestia/3D Models/CMS_File|CMS Model Files]] are unique to Celestia. They use a simple textual format. The CMS format is deprecated.

===CMOD===

[[Celestia/3D Models/CMOD_File|CMOD Model Files]] are unique to Celestia. They have both binary and textual forms. The format was designed for efficient use by OpenGL code. When drawing a CMOD model, Celestia's framerate is about 1.5-2x as fast as when drawing the equivalent 3DS model. 

A 3DS to CMOD conversion program is available.
CMOD export scripts are available for Anim8or and Blender.

==Modeling Programs==
{{sectstub}}

==Modeling Hints==
{{sectstub}}

==Limitations==
{{sectstub}}
# Models in Celestia do not (yet?) cast shadows on themselves or on other objects.
# Translucent model surfaces are not properly depth sorted. Some are drawn correctly, but some are not.
# DSC Nebula Meshes are not depth sorted at all. They always are drawn in the order that Celestia reads them.

== Parallel and Serial ==

If we want to send out 16 bits worth of data, as we had been doing in the last chapter, we would need to define 16 output ports, and then write our data out to the pins. Here is an example that will output a 1 on every port:

 DIRS = %1111111111111111
 OUTS = 255

Unfortunately, this system doesnt leave us any extra pins to play with. We don't have any available pins to use for inputs or other outputs. In cases like these, we want to use '''serial communications''' instead.

Parallel communications, what we have been doing so far, uses many wires in parallel with one another. Each data bit is transmitted on its own wire, and so to send ''x'' bits we need to use ''x'' wires. In a '''serial''' system, instead of using 16 wires, we use just 1 wire, and send all the data bits on that one wire, one at a time. The target computer, where the data is being sent to, reads each of the bits, one at a time, and stores them in a variable. 

To use serial I/O, we use the SERIN and SEROUT functions

== Serial Settings ==

Serial I/O is obviously a little more complicated then parallel data is. For instance, we need to know what speed the data is being sent, so that the target computer can read the data at the same speed. We also need to know a few other things:

;Parity:Parity adds an extra bit to every byte that we transmit. This extra bit can be used to determine if there is an error in the transmission. Parity can be set to &quot;Odd&quot;, &quot;Even&quot;, or &quot;None&quot;.
;Baud:&quot;Baud&quot; is the number of pulses that are transmitted each second. Both the sender and the receiver need to be using the same baud.
;Data Bits:Data bits is the number of bits per &quot;chunk&quot; of information. There are commonly 8 data bits, but 7 is also possible on some hardware.

Both the sender and the receiver need to have the same values for the parity, baud, and data bits. If these are not matched, the communication will not work.

;Port: This is the number of the port to be used to send or receive the data. This can be any of the regular data ports 0 - 15, or it can be the special dedicated serial port 16. Port 16 is the port that you use to program the BasicStamp. If you use port 16 you will have a fancy serial plug to use, but you won't be able to use the debug features of your BasicStamp. The sender and the receiver can use different ports.

=== Settings Values ===

== SERIN and SEROUT ==

To send serial output, we use the SEROUT command. If we want to read serial data, we use the SERIN command. Because serial can send bits one after the other, we can send long data arrays at once, in addition to sending out single data bytes. We can send entire strings or arrays, if needed.</text>

Now, you said you wanted to write a book about Bahai Education. This sounds like an interesting project. Let me ask you a few questions, before you start:
#What language will you be writing this book in? English? If not english, you should go to [http://www.wikibooks.org the Wikibooks portal], and find the proper language project. If it is english, you are in the right place.
#What will be the title of the book? When you know what the title is, type it into the search box on the left, and click &quot;Go&quot;. This will take you to the page, and you can start typing in some text. 
#Is the book already written? has it already been published? If so, you must release it under the [[GFDL]] license before you upload it here.
I can definitely help you with this project, answer these questions and let me know what you need. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:00, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

Since our founding, volunteers have written about '''[[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]]''' modules in a multitude of textbooks.

The central place to ask questions or discuss ideas is the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] (this is the equivalent to [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]]'s Village Pump; Wikipedians may wish to read our [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians|primer]] before getting started). See also the [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|mailing list]].

If you're an instructor planning on using Wikibooks for a class project, please read our [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects|guidelines for class projects]].

Explore, [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] in editing pages, play around in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]], have fun, and good luck!

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}} 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], unable to sleep, imagines hearing footsteps and voices in the wind, and gets up during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s watch. Hermione agrees with Harry that they should leave early, reinforcing what Harry imagined, and even thinking she saw somebody. As the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|Sneakoscope]] is quiescent, there seems to be no imminent danger, but they [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparate]] under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] just to be safe.

They arrive in the Forest of Dean, at an old campground Hermione once visited with her parents. The snow and bitter cold keeps Harry and Hermione inside the tent the first day. Harry takes the watch; he senses this night is different. In the twilight hours of impenetrable darkness, a bright silver light appears drifting soundlessly through the trees. Gliding closer, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|silver-white doe]] steps out, gazes at Harry, then turns and walks away. Harry follows it deeper into the forest until it halts, then vanishes. Using Hermione's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wand]], Harry casts a light. A frozen pond becomes visible&amp;mdash;the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] lies on the pond's bottom.

After several failed attempts to retrieve the Sword without getting wet, Harry remembers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s words when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|he last retrieved it]]; only a true Gryffindor could have pulled the Sword out of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|the Sorting Hat]]. Stripping down to his underwear, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Diffindo|breaks]] the ice and plunges in. As he grabs the hilt, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|the Locket]], sensing danger, tightens around his neck, strangling him. Kicking and fighting, Harry is unable to loosen the chain's chokehold. Suddenly, someone grabs him, dragging him from the pond. Dazed and shivering, Harry sees the Sword of Gryffindor and a drenched [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. 

Ron denies casting the doe Patronus; he thought it was Harry's, until Harry reminds him that his is a stag. To test the Sword's authenticity, they decide to destroy the Locket. Harry feels Ron should be the one to slay it. Setting the Locket on a nearby stone, Harry says &quot;Open&quot; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. The Locket unlatches and two eyes on its sides stare back&amp;mdash;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] eyes. A voice insults Ron,  preying on his fears and insecurities, but when this fails, distorted Harry and Hermione heads appear, hurling taunts and ridicule, then they kiss. The real Harry yells to stab the Locket. With a single swift stroke, Ron slays the Locket and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s soul shard.

Harry assures a guilt-ridden Ron that Hermione missed him and that there is nothing between her and Harry. Reconciled, they head to the camp where Harry is warmly welcomed by Hermione while Ron is pummeled by her furious fists. Harry intervenes, but a shouting match continues. Ron insists he immediately tried to return but was caught by Snatchers, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry-hired]] bounty hunters searching for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-borns]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood traitor|blood traitors]]. By the time Ron escaped, Harry and Hermione had already moved. Ron eventually located them with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]]; it detects conversations about the person holding it. When Ron heard Harry and Hermione speak his name he was able to use the Deluminator to transport to where they were. It was Ron they heard at their last camp, but they left before he could find them. The Deluminator brought him to where the doe Patronus and Harry were. Hermione is told about the doe, the Sword, and destroying the Locket Horcrux. Ron also gives Harry a wand he 'snatched' from a Snatcher to replace his broken one. Hermione threatens Ron one last time, and the three finally get some sleep.

== Analysis ==
While this chapter is a pivotal turning point in each Trio member's emotional development, Ron undergoes the most significant change. Dumbledore, aware Ron needed extra guidance, left him the Deluminator to help him find his way back should he become separated from the others. Ron's return highlights how significant his role in the Trio truly is, and it marks a distinct milestone in his maturation. From here on, he becomes a more assertive, independent, and contributing member, rather than a passive follower whose insecurity allowed him to take a back seat to Harry, Hermione, and his siblings. Despite his deficiencies, Ron, unknowingly, has served an important function within the group: Harry and Hermione are talented and resourceful wizards, but, being Muggle-raised, they lack significant knowledge about the general Wizarding world. Ron has often guided them by filling in these gaps. It is unlikely Harry and Hermione could succeed without Ron supplying these missing pieces. His humorous, easy-going nature also helps bond the Trio and counter-balances Harry and Hermione's more intense and somewhat dour personalities, though Ron has shown, at least while carrying the Locket Horcrux, that he, like most people, has a rather suppressed dark side to his nature. Ron also proves he is a true Gryffindor by overcoming his fears and doubts about the mission, and returning to a dangerous situation to search for and help his friends. He also demonstrates immense bravery by rescuing Harry from the freezing pond. Harry expresses his appreciation by insisting that Ron destroy the Locket Horcrux; though, at least initially, and when the Horcrux is fighting for its life, Ron may be uncertain that this is a favour. While Hermione is furious at Ron for having deserted the mission, his brief absence actually proves useful. Upon his return, he provides vital information about Voldemort and the war, warns them that the Dark Lord's name is now &quot;tabooed&quot;, and explains what Snatchers are. By being too elusive and cut off from their allies who could provide critical information and support, the Trio have made their quest more difficult and dangerous. From here on, they will utilize information gathered from various allies.

A different facet to Hermione's personality is exposed in response to Ron's return. For the first time in her life, she is so overcome with hurt and anger that she loses control, and, unable to think rationally, reacts without logic or forethought. Only Harry's intervention prevents her from inflicting physical harm on Ron. Although furious that he deserted the mission, Hermione was likely feeling abandoned and betrayed by someone she cares deeply about. This outburst may also show that Hermione is learning to act more intuitively and freely without always waiting until she feels she knows all the answers before taking action. Ron, meanwhile, literally comes face-to-face with his own unresolved feelings for Hermione when he witnesses false images of Harry and Hermione kissing projected by the Locket as it attempts to protect itself. Harry, who also sees this spectacle, assures Ron that he and Hermione love each as brother and sister, and tells him how important he is to their trio.

Harry not only shows another side to his innate courage, but also his growing ability to trust others. Despite not knowing if friend or foe sent the doe Patronus, and after the nearly disastrous encounter with the bogus [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], Harry takes yet another leap of faith by following the doe in the hope that this time it was sent to help. However, youthful curiosity may have helped to override caution, and Harry avoids consulting Hermione, knowing she would be far more suspicious and leery following their near-fatal experience in Godric's Hollow. It is confirmed, however, that the silver doe was indeed dispatched to help; the question now is, who sent it and why?

An adult reading this chapter may also note that Ron mentions nothing about having told [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] where he was going, or even that he was leaving, when he departed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]]. This rather leads one to wonder what Bill and Fleur thought when they found his room empty. We do see that Ron took time to pack a rather large knapsack for the trip, rather than just setting out after the light from the Deluminator as he implies in his story; we can only hope, for Bill and Fleur's sake, that he at least left them a note, though they may not have been too surprised by his leaving, knowing Ron had been on a mission with Harry and Hermione.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Ron will also bring back information about &quot;Potter Watch&quot;, an underground wizard news radio program that airs updates about Harry and the war against Voldemort. The information in this broadcast will prove extremely heartening to Harry, as he learns that he is not alone in fighting Voldemort. It will, however, inadvertently result in the Trio being captured.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|We learn later]] that the doe was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape's]] Patronus. Carefully examining the text shows that Hermione had her beaded bag open when she told Harry where they had stopped. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]]'s portrait inside it overheard Hermione and reported that to Snape. Snape thus knows that Harry and Hermione are in the [http://www.visitforestofdean.co.uk/ Forest of Dean], though not exactly where; the Forest of Dean is a largish place, several wooded sections totaling about 40 square miles. (It is located a few miles west of Gloucester in the south-west of England.) It is open to question how Snape found Harry, given the protective spells Hermione had set around them. This must, of course, be supposition, but we already know that many spells are limited by distance, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] being one; it is likely that once he was within a few miles of Harry, Snape could use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]] to see what Harry was seeing, and thus determine where he was. This would be easier for Snape because he had previously spent time in Harry's mind. After learning the Trio's general whereabouts from Nigellus, it appears Snape sent the Patronus in the hope that Harry would see and follow it to where Snape hid the Sword in the pond. It will be seen in a later chapter that more than one Patronus can be cast at a time, and there may have been multiple ones roaming the forest searching for Harry.

This is the first time Snape's Patronus is seen. It is learned later in the book that its form is somehow related to Lily Potter, and for a specific reason. Readers might consider how and why Tonks' Patronus had changed its shape, something that Snape had ridiculed her for. 

There is one additional interesting note. Mr. Ollivander later tells Harry that if a wizard captures another wizard's wand, that wand's allegiance can be transferred to its new owner. Ron provides Harry a wand he took from a Snatcher, making it possible that Ron is actually that wand's new master. However, Harry can still use it, though likely with less effectiveness than if he had been the one who forcibly obtained it. Harry will later seize and wield [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]'s wand, finding that it performs quite well for him, while Hermione, who is given Bellatrix's confiscated wand rather than having captured it herself, discovers it works poorly when she uses it. Harry capturing Draco's wand plays a crucial role in Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort, who has stolen the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] from Dumbledore's tomb. Voldemort will also discover that this wand, the most powerful in the world, fails to meet his great expectations, though he is initially unable to understand why.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] awakens the next morning half-expecting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to be in his bunk, but finds it empty. Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] delay packing, knowing Ron will be unable to find them once they leave. Unable to wait any longer, they [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparate]] to a wind-swept hillside. Hermione breaks down in sobs, while Harry casts the protective spells around their campsite. For the next few days, Harry watches for Ron's dot on his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], certain he has returned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], but it never appears. At night, Harry and Hermione spend hours discussing where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] could have hidden [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]]. Harry is uncertain if he is angrier at Ron for leaving, or at Dumbledore for failing to give him more information. Ron's words haunt him: &quot;''We thought you knew what you were doing&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. We thought you had a real plan!''&quot; Ron was right; Dumbledore left him with virtually nothing, and the remaining [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] are still just as unattainable.

At night, Hermione brings out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus']] portrait. Despite his threat never to visit it again but curious for information, he agrees to show up blindfolded every few days. Phineas only sporadically reveals information about Hogwarts, although Harry and Hermione learn about a low-level student mutiny. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] has reinstated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s decree prohibiting three or more students from gathering or any unofficial student societies, although Harry speculates that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] have probably revived [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. Harry briefly yearns for Hogwarts' comforts, only to remember he is &quot;Undesirable Number One.&quot;

The weather grows colder, and the two constantly move to new locations throughout the country. Christmas trees begin appearing in sitting room windows. Hermione shows Harry a strange hand-drawn symbol in ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. She is unable to decipher it, but has determined it is something other than an eye icon or an ancient rune in the syllabary. Harry recognizes it as the same triangular symbol [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] was wearing at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|the wedding]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Krum]] had claimed it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald's]] mark. Someone drawing a Dark mark in a children's book is puzzling to Hermione. Meanwhile, Harry, curious about his history, proposes going to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]]; surprisingly, Hermione agrees, believing Dumbledore may have hidden the Sword in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]]'s birthplace. She pulls out ''A History of Magic'' by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] and reads a passage about Godric Gryffindor. Harry remembers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Aunt Muriel]] telling him at the wedding that Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric's Hollow. Both silently notice that Harry deliberately avoided referring to Muriel as ''Ron's'' aunt. A thought suddenly occurs to Hermione&amp;mdash;maybe Dumbledore entrusted the Sword to Bathilda.

Harry and Hermione immediately make plans to go to Godric's Hollow. Hermione first wants to practice Disapparating together under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], plus a few other spells, but Harry only thinks about seeing his birthplace. It is another week before they depart for Godric's Hollow. Using some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] hairs that Hermione obtained for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], they transform into a middle-aged couple. They Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak to Godric's Hollow, but once there, Harry suggests removing the Cloak. A war memorial in the town square suddenly transforms into a statue of a man and a woman holding an infant. Astonished, Harry recognizes the two figures as his parents, and the baby as himself. While looking inside a church cemetery, they unexpectedly discover [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana Dumbledore]]'s graves; Harry again wonders why Dumbledore never shared their common roots. On the grave marker is the inscription: &quot;Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,&quot; though Harry is uncertain what it means. While searching for the Potters' graves, Hermione spots something. Carved on an old tombstone is the same symbol that was in the book and that Xenophilius wore. The stone's letters are badly weathered, and only the first name, Ignotus, can be read.

They continue hunting until Hermione calls out, &quot;Harry, they're here&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. right here.&quot; The Potters' white marble headstone is only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana. Below James and Lily's names is the inscription: ''The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death''  

Confused, Harry thinks this sounds like a Death Eater concept, but Hermione says it means to defeat death by existing beyond it. Its meaning provides little comfort to Harry, knowing his parents' moldering remains lie beneath the frozen ground. He sobs a bit, and Hermione takes his hand. Harry feels bad that he forgot to bring something for his parents, but Hermione, unasked, conjures a wreath of roses that Harry lays on the graves. They quietly turn to leave the cemetery.

== Analysis ==

Although Harry wanted to &quot;go it alone&quot; on this mission, he now sorely misses Ron's presence and realizes how much he relied on his help and friendship. This may be a crucial turning point for Harry in learning to trust others and accept their help. He currently only has Hermione for support, but this could place an ever greater burden on her. Ron's painful absence also shows a sharp contrast to Hermione's steadfast loyalty, and it is doubtful that Harry could have gotten as far as he has without her assistance. In the past, he and Ron have tended to dismiss her contributions and abilities except when they needed specific information about something. Her careful planning and foresight has allowed the Trio to move relatively efficiently and comfortably throughout the country during their Horcrux search. Her diligent research methods and cool, logical mind will continue to be a useful resource to the mission. However, living by her wits and surviving day-to-day in a life-threatening situation have also greatly improved her practical skills and abilities, forcing her to also rely on intuition, speculation, and immediate action rather than always poring over books for definitive answers before taking action. Her quick, sharp reflexes have repeatedly saved the Trio from disaster, as when she Disapparated them away from Bill and Fleur's wedding and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], and may do so again in future chapters.

Seeing Kendra and Ariana's tombstone disturbs Harry nearly as much as his own parents' graves. This reminder that Dumbledore had a hidden history, or that Harry never asked about it, reignites Harry's anger and confusion over Dumbledore's cryptic plan. The inscription on the gravestone, &quot;Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,&quot; further frustrates Harry, who fails to understand how deeply Dumbledore loved his mother and sister. Harry again wonders why Dumbledore never revealed their common roots, though Skeeter's book leads us to believe the Dumbledore family only moved to Godric's Hollow to keep Ariana's condition hidden. Also, having discovered Ariana's existence causes Harry to ponder how much truth might actually back [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book.

It is interesting to note that the Potters' statue is (appropriately) disguised as a war memorial. Not only did [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] fight against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] in life, but they continue their battle in death through their son, Harry.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although Harry has abandoned his dream to be reunited with his dead parents, when he learns about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] (and the Resurrection Stone), this possibility will be revived.

Harry and Hermione have no idea where to search for Gryffindor's Sword, and they are taking a huge gamble and using precious time in hope that Dumbledore hid it in Godric's Hollow. However, there could be another way to retrieve the Sword. Readers likely will remember that in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], Harry pulled Gryffindor's Sword from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] when he fought the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. While this could be one possible way to obtain the Sword, neither Harry or Hermione considers it. There is certainly no guarantee that the Sorting Hat can or would provide the Sword on demand, or if it is at all possible to obtain the Hat that is safely secured in the Hogwarts Headmaster's office. Even if Harry's allies inside Hogwarts attempted to retrieve it, given the Castle's tight security, it could be a difficult undertaking for any student, even resourceful Dumbledore's Army members, to breach the Headmaster's office, particularly now that Snape is in residence there. And given [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s previous unsuccessful attempt to steal the Sword of Gryffindor, their punishment could potentially be far more severe for a second offence. However, as the Sorting Hat may generally be considered an innocuous magical object that Harry would not be seeking, it is plausible that it could be removed from the Headmaster's office, possibly with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall's]] help. Also, considering how effortlessly Hermione was able to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] the restricted books from Dumbledore's study, the Sorting Hat might likewise be retrieved. However, Snape, likely aware that the Sorting Hat has this ability, may have taken steps to protect it.

Harry will eventually obtain Gryffindor's Sword, not with the Sorting Hat, but with help from an unidentified ally. However, the Sorting Hat will again prove important later in the story when it provides Gryffindor's Sword to Neville Longbottom, who Harry tasks with destroying a remaining Horcrux should he, Ron, or Hermione be unable to.

The inscription on Lily and James' grave seems to reflect a Death Eater sensibility to Harry, and Hermione's counter-explanation feels weak to him, as it does to us. Reflecting on this inscription, we must wonder who wrote it. It is, of course, originally from the Bible (1 Corinthians 15:26), although one wonders if Rowling expects her readers to pick up on this. It is unlikely that it was authored by James or Lily, as they were quite young, and had likely given little thought to what would come after their deaths. As he was a close friend, it is possible that it would have been written by Dumbledore. If it was, we can see that the inscription proceeds from the story of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], and the belief that the one who controls all three Hallows can conquer Death. The Hallows would be close to the surface of Dumbledore's mind at that point. In addition to the Hallow that he himself possessed, he was also examining another of the three Hallows, the Invisibility Cloak, that he had borrowed from James. Dumbledore might have suffered a shade of guilt, thinking that with the Cloak, Harry's parents may have evaded Voldemort. For whatever reason, though, the inscription does seem to tally with a later declaration of the Hallows' power, better than it does either with Hermione's explanation or with Harry's understanding.</text>

Hello, readers.  This book is sponsored by Mind As Lab publication, a company which I started to create free and open-source documentation and software creation. When I buy technical books in India, they are surely substandard. Books that are sold in USA and Europe have color prints, hence they helps those students understand better. Those copies that were printed for India, Pakistan and other nations had only black and white content. They were done so to make those books cheap.

Here in Wikipedia I have the opportunity to create a book for electronics with Multimedia content. Once the books has enough volume, it will be converted to PDF and published on the internet for free (free over here stands for freedom like free speech, not like free beer).

This book aims to provide software to make student life easy. Currently Mind As Lab is experimenting with animation.  If it becomes a success, in the far future this book will provide built-in movies explaining selected concepts.

== Target ==

Semiconductor Electronics is a book that is targetted at students studying electronics. This book was initially started by A.K.Karthikeyan to provide comprehensive material for students.


== Authors ==

* [[User:A.K.Karthikeyan | A.K.Karthikeyan]]

If you have contributed to this book, feel free to add your name.

==Support==

Thanks to many for their support in writing this book. Special thanks to Mind As Lab, which will publish this book in full color print in the Indian subcontinent.  Thanks to Chitra and Sohail, graphic designers at Mind As Lab, for providing many SVG images that will enhance the book. Thanks to all open-source programmers who have released various tools under the GPL license (specially under GPL v.3); it is really them who need to be credited.

Thanks to the Mind As Lab accounting team for providing funding worth Rs.200/week to make this book a reality.  I wish more funds be forthcoming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the year 1904 J.A. Fleming introduced the vacuum tube diode. Shortly thereafter in 1906 Lee De Foster added the third element the control grid to the diode, thus making the first vacuum tube amplifier the triode. By 1930, pushed by electronics industry the vacuum tube had four elements in it and was called tetrode, the five element version was called pentode. Vacuum tubes became so popular for electronics that their production that was about 1 million in 1920 rose to 100 millions by 1937.

It was on December 23 1947, the demonstration by Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen in Bell Telephone Labs introduced the Bipolar Junction Transistor. Its advantage over Vacuum tubes was imminent, it had no heater element, required less power to operate, it was small and light weight, it required no warming up.

Unlike vacuum tube it lasted longer, could have a rugged construction. Hence Transistors gained dominance over vacuum tubes.

== Transistor Construction ==

A transistor is constructed by placing a oppositely doped semiconductor material between two similarly doped semiconductors. Or placing n-type material between two p-type material which forms the pnp-transistor or by placing a p-type material between two n-type semiconductor which forms npn-transistor.

:[[File:PNP_Transistor_Construction.svg|200px]]

The above diagram shows the schematic construction of a PNP transistor. As you can see an N-type silicon (green layer) is sandwiched between two P type materials (red layer). The left part is indicated by P+ which means its highly doped P-type material. This highly doped portion is called '''Emitter''', that is the piece of semiconductor that supplies majority carriers for the transistor to function. At the extreme right is moderately doped P type material which is called as the '''Collector'''. This portion collects the majority charge carriers that is been emitted by Emitter and that manage to cross the collector. The middle region is denoted by n- because it's doped with N-type impurities. The minus'-' sign indicates it's doped very very less compared to the emitter and collector. The middle region is called the '''Base''', and it's this region that serves as a gate, regulating flow of charge from Emitter to collector.

The doping of base is just one tenth of that of collector. In a real transistor, the width of base is very thin. The total width of the transistor will be 150 times that of the width of the base.

In a similar way by sandwiching a lightly doped P region between highly and moderately doped N region we get a NPN transistor as shown below.

:[[File:NPN_Transistor_Construction.svg|200px]]

== Transistor Operation ==

To see how transistor operates we will look at how an PNP transistor works. NPN transistor works the same way as PNP, but with voltage and currents reversed.

Below is the diagram of PNP transistor. One can see that its emitter is held more positive than base and base more positive than collector. When emitter-base is forward biased and collector based is reversed bias, the transistor is said to be in active region. It's in the active region that transistor acts as a amplifer and so on. So let's study about it.

See the image below for active biasing of PNP transistor.

Now let's sat we remove the voltage between base and collector hence the circuit looks as follows.

Let's analyze it.

== Common Base Configuration ==

'''It has following properties 
* low input impedance
* high output impedance
* high voltage gain
* unity (or less) current gain

== Transistor Amplifying Action ==

== Common Emitter Configuration ==
'''As well as being used as a switch to turn load currents &quot;ON&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot; by controlling the Base signal to the transistor, NPN Transistors can also be used to produce a circuit which will also amplify any small AC signal applied to its Base terminal. If a suitable DC &quot;biasing&quot; voltage is firstly applied to the transistors Base terminal thus allowing it to always operate within its linear active region, an inverting amplifier circuit called a Common Emitter Amplifier is produced.
One such Common Emitter Amplifier configuration is called a Class A Amplifier. A Class A Amplifier operation is one where the transistors Base terminal is biased in such a way that the transistor is always operating halfway between its cut-off and saturation points, thereby allowing the transistor amplifier to accurately reproduce the positive and negative halves of the AC input signal superimposed upon the DC Biasing voltage. Without this &quot;Bias Voltage&quot; only the positive half of the input waveform would be amplified. This type of amplifier has many applications but is commonly used in audio circuits such as pre-amplifier and power amplifier stages.
With reference to the common emitter configuration shown below, a family of curves known commonly as the Output Characteristics Curves, relates the output collector current, (Ic) to the collector voltage, (Vce) when different values of base current, (Ib) are applied to the transistor for transistors with the same β value. A DC &quot;Load Line&quot; can also be drawn onto the output characteristics curves to show all the possible operating points when different values of base current are applied. It is necessary to set the initial value of Vce correctly to allow the output voltage to vary both up and down when amplifying AC input signals and this is called setting the operating point or Quiescent Point'''

== Common Collector Configuration ==

== Limits of Operation ==

== BJT Specification Sheet ==

== Transistor testing ==
Using multimeter we connect the red and black probe to the lead of transistor first we find the base by moving up the probe to any lead of the transistor for which probe remain on the lead of the transistor and the other is on any two lead of the transistor that the base. Collector (C) we denote that red probe is for finding the collector we notice that when we set off the probe to the lead of the trasistor the multimeter will deflect half of the scale and by changing position we see that multimeter deflect more than half of the scale

== Transistor Casing and Terminal Identification ==
After the transistor has been manufactured using one of the techniques, it leads of, typically, gold, aluminum, or nickel are then attached and the entire structure is encapsulated in a container. Those with the heavy duty construction are high-power devices, while those with the small can (top hat) or plastic body are low- to medium-power devices. 
Note the very small size of the actual semiconductor device. There are gold bond wires, a copper frame, and an epoxy encapsulation. Four (quad) individual pnp silicon transistors can be housed in the 14-pin

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Matter and Electricity==
=== Insulators ===
Insulators are those materials that don't conduct electricity under normal conditions. For instance: air is an insulator. You don't get electrocuted when approaching a plug point since air is an insulator. In abnormal conditions, air behaves like a conductor. For example, during a thunderstorm, extremely high voltage create lightning bolts, which jump from one cloud to another or to the ground.  At these extreme situations, air will act as a conductor.

=== Conductors ===
Conductors are substances that easily let electrical charge pass through them with relatively very-less resistance. Almost all metals are conductors. When ever you cut an electric wire, you can see copper or some other metal at its core. Its because these metals can easily conduct electricity. Silver can conduct electricity better than Copper, Copper can conduct electricity better than gold. We don't use them because they are extremely expensive due to their rarity. In cases where electrical circuit needs to be short, like in PCBs and in ICs , gold has been used. Gold is preferred over silver because its inert and doesn't react and / or corrode as quickly as silver.

=== Semiconductors ===
[[Image:Diamond and graphite.jpg|thumb|300px|Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in structure.]]
Semiconductors are materials that behave like both conductors and insulators. In certain condition a semiconductor acts like a conductor. For example charcoal and graphite which are allotrope of Carbon act as conductor. Whereas diamond which has a different crystal structure act as an insulator. The conductivity of semiconductors can be increased by adding certain impurities to them this is called doping. The conductivity may increase by pumping energy into semiconductor crystal in the form of heat or light.

==Science Behind Conduction==

===Atom of an Insulator ===
All atom has a central nucleus which a heavy positively charged mass with relatively small size and located at the center of the atom. The negatively charged electrons go around the nucleus in a path which we call orbit. This is very similar to our solar system. We have Sun, a heavy mass at the center and planets, comets and asteroids go around the Sun. This model was proposed by Niels Bhor, and is called Bhors atomic model.

It's wrong to think that an orbit is a single well defined path. Instead each orbit consists of many sub orbitals. This is shown in the diagram below. The outer most orbit of an atom can be divided into various sub orbitals or bands.  As you can see I have divided into three colors. The lower most band is called a valence band. The electrons in this band determine the valency of the atom. The upper most band is called the conduction band. In this band, the electron is farthest from the positively charged nucleus and is capable of easily escaping out of the atom and thus enabling the material / atom to conduct electricity.

[[Image:SE_Atom.svg]]

Normally an insulator atom does not conduct electricity because there is a forbidden energy gap between the valence and conduction band. The electron has to over come the forbidden energy gap in order for it to orbit in conduction band and conduct electricity. In insulators the forbidden energy gap is very huge, and hence an insulator does not conduct electricity under normal conditions.

However if we can ap an insulator atom with enough power, it can conduct electricity. For example air is an insulator. But during thunder storm lightning bolts pass through air. This is because, the  potential difference between  two clouds or between the cloud and the ground is enough to make electrons in Nitrogen and Oxygen atoms in air to jump from valence to conduction band. This makes air an temporary conductor till the lightning bolt strikes its destination.

===Atom of a Conductor ===
Below you can see the diagram of an atom of an conductor. Here you can notice that there is no forbidden energy gap. The valence and conduction band are overlapping each other. Hence its extremely easy for electrons to move from valence to conduction band. Hence conductors easily conduct electricity without much loss of energy. They conduct electricity under normal conditions.

[[Image:SE_Atom_Conductor.svg]]

===Atom of Semiconductor===

[[Image:SE_Atom_Semiconductor.svg]]

In a semiconductor the forbidden energy gap is neither too high nor two low; for example bandgap of Si is 1.1 eV, Ge is 1.43 eV. In normal conditions some atoms of a semiconductor conduct while other behave like an insulator. This is because there is non homogeneous energy distribution among atoms. Certain atoms have enough energy for their electrons to orbit in conduction band whereas others don't have enough hence their electrons stay in the valence band.

By pumping a little amount of energy or by adding certain impurities to an semiconductor crystal we can make it behave like a conductor. Its these properties of a semiconductor that makes it highly useful for electronics which you will understand as you read this book further and further.

Group IV (four) of the periodic table namely atoms like Carbon, Silicon, Germanium come under semiconductor class.

== Development ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Throughout the series, there is continual '''character development''' that begins in earnest in the fourth year (''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''), the year deeper emotions emerge in each character, and particularly the three main heroes. That [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is not inherently bent toward evil is well established in the fifth year (''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''). However, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|final book]], Harry is fully humanized, being more than the &quot;good&quot; hero, but also a person with a full range of emotions, even selfishness. For adolescence, this includes love interests that are increasingly complicated, awareness of the lines that blur good and evil. Sometimes things aren't completely black and white, which leads to growth and clarity of one's views of others (especially those whom one has idolized).

As an example, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] is viewed as &quot;good&quot; throughout the series, but throughout ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', and by his own admission in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|''King's Cross'']], he is seen as capable of &quot;evil&quot; choices too. Putting the search for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Hallows]] above his family, which ended in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|his sister]]'s death, cost him dearly in terms of his own view of self, his relationship with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|brother]], and his awareness of his own limitations on possessing power.

Harry takes a similar journey through temptation. Like &quot;real people in real life,&quot; it is only in Harry's being presented with the option to selfishly seek and possess power through the Hallows, or to willingly make his desires subordinate to the needs of others, that he becomes fully matured. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] or Hallows? Hallows or Horcruxes? The question perplexes Harry for a time. Should he choose what is easy or what is good? What is good or what is evil? What is beneficent or what is selfish? Power or purpose? Harry could not mature, nor could he or anyone else know who he truly was as a person, until he faced this personal trial and triumphed over the temptation in order to live out the actions that define him as ultimately good. Harry must complete the mission he has been given regarding the Horcruxes, and ultimately [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], (which, per [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|the prophecy]], only he is capable of finishing) in order to remain selfless and &quot;good.&quot;

There is less to say about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] with regard to character development, but we do have a chance in this final book to see each of them experience opportunities to take on the responsibility of leadership. Interestingly, Ron also has to deal with the same &quot;coming of age&quot; realizations that have been described about Dumbledore and Harry above. He has, to this point, believed that Harry &quot;had the answers.&quot; Thus, he must also confront who the friend he has idolized really is; Harry is a human boy with some great talent and exceptional luck, but who still lacks understanding for things that have not been revealed to him.

Here, Hermione is able to display not only her academic knowledge, but also her insights into people, relationships (except when it comes to Ron), and emotions. From this view, it is easy to see why Hermione was not disillusioned by the &quot;real&quot; Harry, since she has already had to bail him out before with the knowledge he lacked, and spent previous encounters explaining to the boys why girls, boys, and people in general do some of the things they do. Quite apart from the physical (the author has told us her birthday falls in September, making her six months older than Ron and ten months older than Harry), she is emotionally more mature from the start than either Harry or Ron, because she grasps who they are, has grace for their weaknesses, and has a clear view of her role in their relationships and common mission. She only loses sight of this for a couple of weeks, as she grieves Ron's walking out on them, but recovers enough to take the lead while Harry is engaged in his own aforementioned struggle to come of age and enter adulthood.

Three aspects of each characters' development empower Harry's and his comrades' triumph of good over Voldemort's and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters']] evil:

#'''Love''' - it provides power and courage (to Harry and the rest) that Voldemort has never known, a selfless purpose for fighting to win, and is even able to protect others through powering &quot;ancient magic&quot;.
#'''Wisdom''' - is also a weakness of Voldemort, and a strength that Harry can tap into with the help of those around him. He does not come to it completely alone, but in the end is able to connect all the dots, as Dumbledore did. Yet Harry establishes his own identity and even a bit of authority by bringing the crayons along to colour in the picture. We are not discussing mere information or knowledge, but a depth of understanding that digs deeper, to get past the &quot;how?&quot; of things and straight to the &quot;why?&quot;. This is what saves Harry in the end: he truly grasps the full meaning of the prophecy, his role and '''why''' it is his, '''why''' Voldemort is weak in this area, and the implications of not only the connection between their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wands]], but the also the blood they share (since Voldemort stole a few drops when he regained his body), and thus, '''why''' he will be able to defeat Voldemort and live &lt;small&gt;(more on this [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Analysis|here]])&lt;/small&gt;. A second aspect of wisdom, which Harry, Ron, and Hermione will come to accept is that things are not always as they seem. Nothing is black and white, nor easily interpreted. Dumbledore didn't die because of someone else's choices, but due to his own greed and actions. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] was not the consummate evil character always searching for a means to betray or destroy them all in support of Voldemort. He was, in fact, motivated to protect Harry by his unrequited love for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]]: a choice made consistently in the face of the pain it caused him by Harry's constant reminders, physically both by his similarity to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father]], reminding Snape of his father's character who inflicted humiliation and suffering upon Snape, and his constant reminder of Lily because he had Lily's eyes. Similarly, Harry's good father was capable of being a cruel bully, his mother of befriending a Slytherin, etc.
#'''Selflessness''' - One might be tempted to attach this to love, and indeed love is often the motivation, but there is still a point at which it is a separate issue. One must take action, and do something externally that demonstrates their internal choices. Harry triumphs over his personal desires for the Hallows, and pursues the Horcruxes instead. Ron triumphs over his disillusionment and anger and sacrifices his own pride (ego) to rejoin his companions on the mission and catalyze them back into action. Hermione, at the crucial juncture, puts the needs of the mission, Harry, and the many that it will save before her desire for a relationship and connection with Ron. They all prove themselves capable of being selfless, as do the members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]], and of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], (like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who winds up a hero in his own right) and all those who stand to fight for what is good rather than settle for what is easy. Harry, in the end, must willingly choose to lay down his life, and in so doing actually ensures his comrades' safety and his own survival &lt;small&gt;(more on this [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Analysis|here]])&lt;/small&gt;.

According to the author, a key event in Harry's maturation occurs in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Up until that time, he has basically reacted, going where he was led, with one apparent exception: he chose to attempt to protect the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], with assistance from Ron and Hermione, as early as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|first book]]. It could be argued that he was led to that decision by circumstance, as evidence had been dragged under his nose that someone was after the Stone, and there was no adult who seemed willing to accept that evidence; but it was debatable whether he had actually made a wise choice. Apart from that, throughout the series up until the episode at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], Harry acts either as he is instructed to act, or in a way that places him directly between Voldemort and his goals, as best Harry understands them. In the events at Shell Cottage, though he finally understands that Voldemort wants the Elder Wand and is about to get it, Harry refuses to enter the race, instead speaking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] about wand lore, and with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]], in order to work around Voldemort's plans instead of trying to face him head on. From that point on, Harry heads in his own direction, largely unsteered by what Voldemort is doing. Whether that can be classed as &quot;development&quot; or not is uncertain; it does seem to be a clear maturation.

Any discussion of maturation on Harry's part must finally include the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|penultimate confrontation]] between Harry and Voldemort. Harry has learned through Snape's memories that Harry's fate is to be killed by Voldemort. While the prospect fills him with fear, he yet moves towards his doom, aware that his own death should protect those he cares about (the defenders of Hogwarts) from further injury at Voldemort's hand. It is his choice to make that sacrifice, and it is a hard one; yet he chooses the path of sacrifice, rather than running away from it as he has in earlier books.

== Overall ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

A major point in the final book is the completion of the greater picture, which Rowling finesses better than anyone speculated. The major issues are the dual-core [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|phoenix]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wands]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry-Voldemort Shared Thoughts|soul tie or mind connection]], the shared blood, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s demise and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] survival in light of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] about them both. Each aspect has a clue in the past history of the series, which plays into the larger picture of the completion of the full plot at the end:

#First, since previous books have confirmed its contents and truthfulness, the Prophecy gives the framework around which everything must fit. &quot;Either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives,&quot; has to be finished, and Harry was already marked by Voldemort as the person to whom the prophecy refers. Their two wands' dual core connection is explained by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|the ''King's Cross'' chapter]], but it should be added that since Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his restoration, prior to the duel that led to the &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]]&quot; effect, both wands would have recognized the other wizard as both kin and owner. Thus, Voldemort tries a different wand ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy's]]), but lacks the wisdom to grasp the full implication of its failure (Harry finally gets it, and it is truly on his own, because he makes the connections once the flaws in Dumbledore's and Voldemort's plans are revealed)... neither of their own wands could have destroyed the other person, making possession of the Elder Wand quite important.
#This is also a point where both Dumbledore's and Voldemort's plans are flawed. Neither recognized that the Elder Wand would see first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] and, after Draco's defeat, Harry as its owner. Voldemort thought he could be the owner by killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], who had acted on Dumbledore's wishes to the end (despite the personal cost and risk to himself, even Snape proved to be selfless), and Dumbledore may have failed to recognize Draco's &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Expelliarmus]]&quot; as a &quot;defeat&quot; that potentially transferred ownership of the wand to Draco. While Dumbledore did understand that a wand would transfer its allegiance to the person who removed it by force from its current owner, he was clearly planning to die unchallenged, and thus break the wand's power by leaving no wizard from which one could forcefully capture the wand. As is affirmed, Dumbledore made good guesses, but he often arranged back up in case he, or a situation, went wrong. In this case, Dumbledore likely planned either to be entombed with the wand, or to have the wand given peacefully to Snape; in either case, the wand's power would have died with Draco had Harry not captured Draco's wand.
#The mind/soul connection between Harry and Voldemort is also brought full circle and explained. From the moment it is first guessed at, to the end of the sixth book, everyone around him, including Harry, is in a hurry to shut this connection down. Even during the final book, he is often cajoled to at least attempt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] although he was never good at it. Ironically, it is this connection that allows Harry access to vital knowledge of Voldemort's actions and plans, and is the means by which he knew [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]], knowledge which helped save his life in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. As is mentioned in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry-Voldemort Shared Thoughts#Analysis|associated article]], it is possible that occlumency would not have worked in any case; it is unknown whether the magic designed to defend one against another wizard trying to retrieve your memories will also work to defend against a wizard attempting to force thoughts and images into your mind, and it is unknown whether it would be possible to defend against images coming from a soul shard attached to one's own soul.
#&quot;Harry as a Horcrux&quot; was created by Voldemort's carelessness during his first reign of terror. Harry must kill this piece of Voldemort's soul within him without killing himself. Yet, per the prophecy, there is no way around things: either Harry or Voldemort must die, and Harry initially believes that this means he is expected to kill Voldemort. Harry, learning of Voldemort's soul fragment within himself, finally understands he must die in order to defeat Voldemort. Once he dies, what he learns makes sense on several levels. It eliminates the soul fragment within Harry, one of only two remaining soul fragments left to hold Voldemort in this life. This makes Voldemort almost vulnerable, now he is very close to the point where he can actually be killed. Harry has come to understand that the Elder Wand does not owe any allegiance to Voldemort, but can only hope that by capturing Draco's wand, he will appear to the Elder Wand as the wizard who wrested it away from Dumbledore. Voldemort unwittingly makes himself a Horcrux for Harry, although it might not be called that, by taking his blood earlier. In taking Harry's blood to regenerate himself, Voldemort ensures that Harry will not die if Voldemort kills him. The blood ties Harry to Voldemort's life, therefore Harry will live. It is mentioned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry-Voldemort Shared Thoughts#Greater Picture|elsewhere in this book]] that this protection does not extend to attempts by anyone else to kill Harry; thus we must assume a campaign to make Voldemort reserve Harry's death for himself.

When all is done, Harry is good to the end, for many reasons. His selfless choice to face Voldemort without fighting back ensures the same charm of love his mother gave him, is now given to all of his comrades defending Hogwarts. (As Harry points out, this is probably why the attacks of Voldemort and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] won't stick when they come back to Hogwarts with Harry's body.) He chooses not to reunite the Hallows and makes decisions that will hopefully remove their power, except for the cloak. He chooses to come back to the pain in his body and life, rather than take the easy path to join his family in peace, in order to complete the defeat of Voldemort. However, he also chooses to accept and trust the help and vested interests of others, so it is possible that Harry makes the final leap of maturity needed to make a difference... he puts aside his need to be linked to his family of the past (which he could have chosen) in order to bring hope (rather than despair) to his present &quot;family of friends.&quot; This final thought is supported by the epilogue of the final chapter that indicates that his godson Teddy, son of Lupin and Tonks, may marry into the family of the friends who have become family comprised of Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who are now all related by marriage.

== Possible Points of Confusion ==

=== Why did Harry not die? ===

We should take a moment here to discuss the complexities of the interrelationship between Voldemort and Harry in the last few chapters of the book. It is not immediately clear why Voldemort does not kill Harry, or why Harry does not die when Voldemort does, there being a blood link there.

First, we should look at the wands. While an interrelation between Voldemort's wand and Harry's has been established, and it is mentioned that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|events in the cemetery]] have made Harry's wand proof against anything Voldemort can throw against him, this is discounted by Christmas. At that point, a charm Hermione uses ends up breaking Harry's wand, and it no longer plays a part in the events. Voldemort, not knowing this, abandons his own wand in favour of the Elder Wand of legend. The Elder Wand will not harm Harry because it accepts Harry as its master – contrary to the apparent path through history, it is not murder that defeats the bearer of the wand, but forcible removal of the wand, so the wand became Draco Malfoy's when Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore, and Malfoy was in turn deprived of his own wand by Harry. Harry is careful to check this with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]]; this is the point where he begins to understand about the Hallows, and starts choosing his own fate accordingly. (It was Malfoy's wand Harry was holding when he defeated Voldemort. Presumably the Elder Wand recognizes the wand that stood against it, possibly in addition to the bearer.) At the same time, Harry cannot be killed by Voldemort because of the blood linkage – as he is using Harry's blood, he provides that protection. Granted, this may seem far-fetched, as Voldemort certainly had Riddle blood in him, but he had murdered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Sr.]] and suffered no ill effects. Then again, Tom Sr. didn't care about Tom Jr., and possibly didn't even know he existed. As what activates the protection, is being willing to die for someone rather than allowing them to be killed, and neither Tom Sr. nor Tom Jr. would die for the other, there was no protection there.

When Harry approaches Voldemort at the end of the book, then, Voldemort's curse knocks Harry's soul into the waystation, but it is then his option whether to go on or return. If he goes on, taking Voldemort with him, there will still be one Horcrux in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] to allow Voldemort to return. However, as the Elder Wand won't harm Harry, he has the option to return, and he chooses that option. As Dumbledore says that the soul fragment within Harry is now gone, the only Horcrux left is Nagini. Once Nagini is dead, thanks to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], there is nothing holding Voldemort's soul to the earth.

There is still the blood link, but that is unidirectional: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] did not die to save Voldemort, did she? So every time that Voldemort uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] against Harry, it will rebound upon him. The first time it rebounded, when Harry was one, it killed Voldemort, but his soul, still held to the earth by five Horcruxes and the soul shard adhering to Harry, remained in Albania. The second time, it partially rebounded, killing the soul fragment in Harry, but Voldemort returned in the same body because he came back with Harry, as he had gone to &quot;King's Cross&quot; with Harry. The third time, with no Horcruxes left, it killed Voldemort outright.

=== What is the nature of the bond between Harry and Petunia Dursley? ===

We know that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] does not like Harry, and Harry absolutely loathes living at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. Yet there must be something that keeps them together. At the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Vernon Dursley]], discovering that Harry is becoming a magnet for trouble that can hurt his family as well as Harry, orders Harry out of his house. Petunia seems to agree with Vernon's decision, until the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] reminds her of Dumbledore's earlier letter, which we must presume was the one left on the Dursley doorstep with Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|at the beginning of the series]]. At that point, Petunia abruptly rationalizes Harry remaining with them, forcing Vernon to back down. Obviously there is a blood relationship between them, as Lily Potter was Petunia's sister. Petunia, however, throughout the series, acts as though Harry has been thrust upon them; she has not accepted this burden willingly. What is compelling her to keep Harry? And why is Harry required to return to Privet Drive every summer? Granted, it does not have to be for the whole summer – at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], for instance, Dumbledore, who obviously is privy to the details of the spells involved, collects Harry from Privet Drive after only a fortnight. What exactly is the nature of the bond that requires Harry to stay with Petunia?

It is stated over and over that Harry's protection came from Lily's sacrifice, and that until he reaches 17 that protection will come from her blood – and Petunia being Lily's sister, a blood relative, means that Lily's blood is in Petunia as well. That protection, which is only protection from Voldemort's direct action, as it was Voldemort's direct action that Lily died trying to prevent, ends when Harry reaches the age of majority and is unable under Wizarding tradition to claim Petunia's home as his own. In the first chapter of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Dumbledore says he has reinforced that ancient magic, but it seems that it is that tie of blood relation which counts.

The word &quot;blood&quot; is used in particular so that we can see the transfer of the source of immunity from Petunia to Voldemort himself in the cemetery in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 32|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']].

As it was Lily's sacrifice that saved Harry's life, it is the shelter under Lily's blood (by way of Petunia) that keeps Harry protected for the first seventeen years of his life. However, this does not provide any protection to Petunia, as Lily certainly did not die to save Petunia's life. While there is no way that this can be anything except speculation, it is possible that what Dumbledore was achieving with his &quot;reinforcements&quot; was extending Harry's protection so that it protected his home as well as himself. This would explain why the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order]] were taking the Dursleys away at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. With Harry reaching his majority and no longer able to (even grudgingly) call Privet Drive &quot;home&quot;, his protection there was ending, and the protection afforded the rest of the family by Dumbledore's reinforcements was likewise ending.

The suggestion has been made &lt;!-- thank you withinfocus --&gt;that Petunia herself might have had some input into this magical bond. After all, her sister Lily, as we have seen, was a very powerful witch. At an age where most witches are able to produce only undisciplined magic, Lily, without a wand, was able to control the magic she was able to do, causing a flower to open and close on command. This ability seems to be uncommon in the Wizarding world; Harry's magic was largely out of his control, and of the other wizards we have seen, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], alone of those under school age, seemed to be able to control the magic he could do. Is it possible that Petunia had some magical ability as well, that was tapped to protect Harry? In fact, no; the author has said that Petunia was doomed to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] for all of her life. While the author had said at one point that some character would do magic late in life, and there was speculation that this would be either Petunia or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]], in an interview following the publication of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' the author stated that the plot had shifted since that time, and the character who had been intended to be a late-blooming witch or wizard had not required that ability. It is possible that Dudley has some trace of magical ability, &lt;!-- Isn't the only requirement to seeing the Dementors &quot;to have seen death&quot;? No, that's Thestrals, and no mention is made of whether Muggles can see them at all. -- chazz --&gt;as he was able to sense the Dementors in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', but he never seemed to be able to perform magic. Even if he had had magical abilities, he was largely out of the secret of Harry's background, and would not have been able to help consciously in any event, being underage.

While this topic is not directly about SQL language, it is sufficiently close to gather information about frequently undertaken administrative tasks together.

=== Dumping database ===

Dumping the database involves creation of a file that stores all the data (rows) and the schema for this data from the desired databases/tables. Most usually it's done as a series of SQL statements, combining CREATE DATABASE / CREATE TABLE statements to recreate the schema and INSERT statements to refill the rows — thus, usually the resulting file can be directly imported using command-line SQL client by simple execution of queries. However, sometimes other output formats are desired and some databases (at least MSSQL) lack the ability to serialize the database as SQL statements from command-line dumper client.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Diode is a marvelous device that passes current only in one direction. Its not necessary that a diode is made of semiconductor, it could be made using vacuum tube valve technology or using electromagnetic switch or using a crystal. We over here concentrate about Semiconductor Diode Alone.

Diode section of Semiconductor Electronics teaches the reader what an Diode is ? How it works ? How it can fail ? It teaches the physics and science behind the operation of the diode.

Diodes can be used for various applications like Voltage Rectification &amp; Regulation, Clipping &amp; Clamping of voltages, making digital logic circuits, modulation, photo-voltaics and so on. Light Emitting Diodes (LED's) are used for light production in visible and invisible region of Electromagnetic spectrum. Many nations have switched their traffic light to LED's so that they have higher operational efficiency. PIN diodes are used for electricity production from light, they constitute much of Solar Cells. Apart from this diodes have many other application which my limited knowledge has failed to take notice.

For a person to be a successful Electronic Engineer, the knowledge, mathematics and science behind a working diode is a must.

== Diode Construction ==
:[[Image:SE_Diode_Construction.svg|200px]]

A diode is formed by joining two equivalently doped P-Type and N-Type semiconductor. When they are joined an interesting phenomenon takes place. The P-Type semiconductor has excess holes and is of positive charge. The N-Type semiconductor has excess electrons. At the point of contact of the P-Type and N-Type regions, the holes in the P-Type attract electrons in the N-Type material. Hence the electron diffuses and occupies the holes in the P-Type material. Causing a small region of the N-type near the junction to loose electrons and behaves like intrinsic semiconductor material, in the P-type a small region gets filled up by holes and behaves like a intrinsic semiconductor.

:[[Image:SE_Diode_Depletion_Region.svg|200px]]

This thin intrinsic region is called depletion layer, since its depleted of charge (see diagram above) and hence offers high resistance. Its this depletion region that prevents the further diffusion of majority carriers. In physical terms the size of he depletion layer is very thin.

== Diode Biased Voltage==

=== Zero Bias ===
[[Image:SE_Zero_biased_diode.svg|200px]]

When a diode is zero biased, that is has no bias, it just stays. Almost no current passes through the diode. However if you connect the anode and cathode of the diode you might be able to observe small voltage or current that is insignificant. This is because the electromagnetic spectrum thats present in our environment by default([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_background Microwave background], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat heat], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light light], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave Radio waves]) knocks off electrons in the semiconductor lattice that constitutes current. For practical reasons this current can be considered zero.

=== Reverse Bias ===
:[[Image:SE_Reverse_Biased_Diode.svg|200px]]

In reverse bias the P-type region is connected to negative voltage and N-type is connected to positive terminal as shown above. In this condition the holes in P-type gets filled by electrons from the battery / cell (in other words the holes get sucked out of the diode). The electrons in N-type material is sucked out of the diode by the positive terminal of the battery. So the diode gets depleted of charge. So initially the depletion layer widens (see image above) and it occupies the entire diode. The resistance offered by the diode is very huge. The current that flows in reverse bias is only due to minority charge which is in nano amperes in silicon and micro amperes in high power silicon and germanium diodes.

=== Forward Bias ===
:[[Image:SE_Forward_Biased_Diode.svg|200px]]

In forward bias the P-Region of the diode is connected with the positive terminal of the battery and N-region is connected with the negative region. During the forward bias the following process occurs. The positive of the battery pumps more holes into the P-region of the diode. The negative terminal pumps electrons into the N-region. The excess of charge in P and N region will apply pressure on the depletion region and will make it shrink. As the voltage increases the depletion layer will become thinner and thinner and hence diode will offer lesser and lesser resistance. Since the resistance decreases the current will increase (though not proportional) to the voltage.

At one particular voltage level &lt;b&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; called the threshold / firing / cut-off voltage the depletion layer disappears (overwhelmed by the charge) and hence from this point on the diode starts to conduct very easily. From this point on the diode current increases exponentially to the voltage applied.

==Ideal Diode==
An Ideal diode has the following characteristics. 
: Zero Forward Resistance . An ideal diode has zero forward resistance. This means if current passes through a diode, it produces no heat loss. In other words an ideal diode in its forward bias acts like a closed switch in a electrical circuit.
: Infinite Reverse Resistance
: Zero Saturation Current I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; 
: Infinite Operating Range

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|params}}

The keyword {{C sharp|params}} is used to describe when a grouping of parameters are passed to a method, but the number of parameters are not important, as they may vary. Since the number isn't important, the {{C sharp|params}} keyword must be the last variable in a method signature so that the compiler can deal with the parameters which have been defined first, before dealing with the params.

Here are examples of where it will, and will not work:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// This works
public static void AddToShoppingBasket(decimal total, params string[] items)
{
  // ....
}

// This works
public static void AddToShoppingBasket(decimal total, int totalQuantity, params string[] items)
{
  // ....
}


// THIS DOES NOT WORK                  &lt;--------------------&gt;
public static void AddToShoppingBasket(params string[] items, decimal total, int totalQuantity)
{
  // ....
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A good example of this is the {{C sharp|String.Format}} method. The {{C sharp|String.Format}} method allows a user to pass in a string formatted to their requirements, and then lots of parameters for the values to insert into the string. Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;

public static string FormatMyString(string format, params string[] values)
{
     string myFormat = &quot;Date: {0}, Time: {1}, WeekDay: {1}&quot;;
     return String.Format(myFormat, DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString(), DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString(), DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek);
}

// Output will be something like:
//
// Date: 7/8/2007, Time: 13:00, WeekDay: Tuesday;
// 
&lt;/source&gt;

The String.Format method has taken a string, and replaced the {0}, {1}, {2} with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd parameters. If the {{C sharp|params}} keyword did not exist, then the {{C sharp|String.Format()}} would need an infinite number of overloads to cater for each case.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public string Format(string format, string param1)
{
  // .....
}

public string Format(string format, string param1, string param2)
{
  // .....
}

public string Format(string format, string param1, string param2, string param3)
{
  // .....
}

public string Format(string format, string param1, string param2, string param3, string param4)
{
  // .....
}

public string Format(string format, string param1, string param2, string param3, string param4, string param5)
{
  // .....
}

// To infinitum
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{C sharp/Keywords}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Physics ==

G'day, before you get too far down the track on your Physics Textbook, have you see our [[Wikibooks:Physics bookshelf]]? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:13, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

== Creating links ==

I just wanted to let you know that when you are creating your book, you cannot make links such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Summary]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This will point to a new book called &quot;Summary&quot;, and that is not what you want. If you want to create a new page, you must title it as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Physics Textbook/Summary]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I fixed many of the links in the book for you yesterday, but you have created more today that need to be fixed as well. I can do it when I get home (I have a bot that can help). Just make sure that when you make new links that you follow the correct format. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:32, 16 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

Feel free to mutilate this page as you see fit, as if you had written it yourself. I don't imagine it's very good :-P --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 02:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== The nuclear waste metaphor ==

I'm currently in the process of converting my &quot;Of monads and space suits&quot; tutorial to a new, less far fetched  metaphor suggested by Paul.  I'm a bit ambivalent about the new metaphor.  On the one hand, it does seem to simplify explanation somewhat, somehow lends it self to less verbiage.  But on the other hand, with nuclear waste, you somehow communicate the idea that the &quot;need&quot; for a container comes from the stuff within, whereas with the space station metaphor, you communicate more the idea that this need comes from something exterior (space)... which seems a bit closer to the truth.  I suggest we keep running with this, though and seeing where it can go  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:43, 3 February 2006 (UTC)


The way I see it, the need for the containers is to stop the waste contaminating our pure functional world with its horrible side effects.  By the way, sorry I haven't been contributing much recently.  Occasionaly my life needs a bit of maintenance.  -- [[User:PaulJohnson|Paul Johnson]] 23:06 6 Feb 2006 (UTC).

I made a very minor change around where the original article had &quot;running around with nuclear waste wouldn't be very healthy... indeed, would cause workers to die.&quot; I thought the tone of the original version was slightly flippant, and on the off chance that the reader has someone he loves who got radiation poisoning, strikes the wrong note. Other than that, I like the article a lot: very helpful in learning haskell.

:Well, maybe you shouldn't mention nuclear waste at all, some activist might get a fit ... And the space example is far from perfect too, you didn't think of people with agoraphobia or claustrophobia at all. I, for example, have political-correctness-phobia and am presently pretty disgusted ;-). Pople are just like that, they like to take offense, so don't get your knickers in twist sidestepping everybody, sooner or later they'll push you into a corner ... 

:Ouch.  I hadn't thought of that.  I guess in the old space suit metaphor, the same flippant tone was more acceptable since... well... how many astronauts do you know? Or maybe that's just not very nice of me in general :-( Thanks for the edit.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== Thank-you anonymous contributer! ==

Why thank you!  You give me faith in wikis. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 10:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== Import of Monads and Space Suits complete ==

Whew!  Now, time for us to remix this with Jeff Newbern's stuff. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:29, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== A bit of feedback ==
First off, this is far and away the best monad tutorial I've come across. The metaphor ''really'' explains the concepts well. I read it (and then All about Monads to consilodate) through yesterday, and I'm now in a position to say I fully understand monads. Thanks!

My ideas for improvement:

* Add a sentence at the end of the 'Use a container' section with words to the effect of &quot;the reason for using containers in actual programming will be explained later&quot;, and then explain it later on. It fits in quite naturally with the state monad stuff. It is in fact implied there but we might as well make it explicit.
* The state monad section diagrams: we've lost the processing robot from the diagrams! This is a shame as it helps visualise (especially with the complicated bind diagram) exactly what we're linking together.
* I think there's scope for a sequel to this chapter: &quot;Advanced Monads&quot; or something. It would explain the monads as computations metaphor, about &gt;&gt; and fail, and explain the MonadPlus class. It might also be nice to talk about lifting, etc.

Thanks once again for the excellent article. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 13:26, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for your comments! I like the metaphor a lot, basically an instantiation of Cale Gibbard's monads as containers notions.  Thanks go to Paul, naturally, for suggesting the shift away from space suits and astronauts. 
:*I'll think about adding the processing robot into the state diagram: at first, I was a bit afraid to over-complicate things, so I figured I would focus only on the fancy container that the robot returns. 
:*And yes, I do agree that somewhere between this chapter and the [[Programming:Haskell monad transformers]] chapter could be much more to say!  Lifting is discussed in the transformers chapter, by the way.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:33, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Some Feedback ==

Thanks for this tutorial.  Still making my way through it, but what I've gotten through so far has been helpful.

I have a minor comment about one of the earlier bits.  I don't particularly find the use of dollar any less hard to read than using parens.  When I read the bit about the paren-use being ugly, I became puzzled and attempted to examine the dollar expression in more detail to see if I'd missed anything.  If anything I find 'i (h (g (f x)))' to be a lot easier to read compared to 'i $ h $ g $ f x'.  Perhaps how readable people find these types of expressions is subjective.

:I agree that in this particular example, the clarity of both variants is about the same.  But there are times that dollar does clearly (in my opinion) help readability out.  Something like 
  a (b ((c d e) (f g h) i)
  a $ b $ (c d e) (f g h) i
:Might be an example.  I guess the point isn't that $ lets you replace parens, but that sometimes, mixed paren-dollar use can make your intention more apparant.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 22:39, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== get and put ==

Dear anonymous contributer, 

Thanks for your correction to the wikibook!  I agree with you that your implementation of get and put (after checking with the Haskell library) is correct, but this implementation needs to be used with an anonymous bind operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, whereas such an operator does not exist in the tutorial.  Please excuse my brutal reverting of your attempt at improving this article.  I think ultimately what I have is bad for people because it does not correspond to the real implemenation of get they will see in real life.  There are several potential fixes to this:
* Overhaul the State explanation, and work in (1) the type constructor (2) anonymous bind
* Call our version of State something like State_ and note that the real State is different, likewise for get_ and put_.
What do you think?  I don't really have time to work on the wikibook right now, but I definitely agree with you that what I have is not quite right.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:08, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

Telling them that the do-notation will translate &lt;code&gt; do {f; g} &lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt; f &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; g &lt;/code&gt; would be fine I think.  A much bigger problem here is that &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; has the wrong type, so &lt;code&gt; get &gt;&gt;= f &lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt; do {st &lt;- get; let st' = f st; put st'} &lt;/code&gt; will not compile at all.
[[User:128.12.197.163|128.12.197.163]] 02:30, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:I've got a game plan, but I don't have time to put it into action just yet.  Just to reiterate, I completely agree with you that we need to change get/put to the &quot;correct&quot; version ASAP.  The basic idea is that we'll introduce the correct get/put and then point out there is a type mismatch, from there say that you need to use it with &lt;code&gt;\_ -&gt; &lt;/code&gt; and from there, and maybe introduce the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.  Will look at it when I have time... or maybe somebody could do something like the above? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 20:42, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

== modify ==

: ''I am saving this text here for now, due to recent work with the anonymous bind operator'' 

Suppose somewhere along the line you want to modify the current state. That is, you want to &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; it, change it in some way, then &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; the new value. So, using do notation you'd have something like this:

 do st &lt;- get
    let st' = f st
    put st'

&lt;code&gt;modify&lt;/code&gt; is a nice little function which you can use instead of the above monotony. It takes a function from state to state, i.e. if you're using &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;s as states then the function you pass in has to be of type &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;. Using modify, the above example becomes:

 modify f

Nice, no?

:Kowey's comments: First of all, thank-you!  I greatly appreciate your contribution to the wiki!  There's a couple of minor issues I have with this, however, and I'm really sorry to be difficult (just like I was being with anonymous bind).  Namely
:# I do not introduce do-notation until the very end of this module
:# While &lt;code&gt;modify&lt;/code&gt; is immensely useful, but it isn't strictly neccessary for understanding monads.
:# It breaks the flow from introducing get/put to introducing the anonymous bind operator, to introduce the Haskell State datatype
:How about we put this into the intermediary chapter on monads that we were planning?  Sort of a monads-in-practice chapter that goes right before the monad transformers one?  What do you think?  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:12, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

== Puzzling metaphor for puzzling concept? ==

As probably many of haskell newbies, I got excited initially, but soon stumbled upon monads. I've read a number of monad tutorials since, and I ''think'' that I began to understand them, partially. I have a big trouble though with the metaphor of &quot;processors&quot; and &quot;containers&quot; (or  &quot;trays&quot; as they are called in another tutorial): to me, it seems deeply illogical that the &quot;processor&quot; has the &quot;packager&quot; built in, while the &quot;unpackager&quot; needs to be external. In a real world (or &quot;metaphor world&quot;) factory, you would rather have either machines that consume containers with input and produce containers with output, or machines that consume raw material and produce raw material, coupled with ''two'' robots: an unpackager in front and a packager at the back.  Likewise, in programming, it seems illogical to develop functions that accept &quot;raw&quot; data but must return &quot;container with data&quot;. A function that would take a &quot;container with raw data&quot; as input and return a &quot;container of the same type with processed data&quot; would look cleaner.


I am sure that there must be some very good and simple explanation for this discrepancy, but as far as I have seen, everyone is just taking it for granted. To me, it's an ugly spot in a beautiful picture.


Am I the only one? If I am not, maybe it would make sense to discuss this issue in the tutorial?


And, oh, this article still is the most comprehensible of what I've read so far... Thanks!
--[[User:Crosser|Crosser]] 19:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:So the question is why there isn't symmetry in this, if I understand correctly.  Well, it's clear that we can't just have raw-raw factories.  Or rather, we can, but then it'd just be regular functions, which we already know how to sequence (think dollar).  Now we want to do fancy things like IO or State passing (it gets much better!), and to do that we can use some kind of container mechanism.  Ok, so that's why we don't have raw-raw factories.

:: The symmetric case would be &lt;code&gt;m a -&gt; m b&lt;/code&gt; which is an arrow, albeight a particular one.
:: Anyway, I think that the explanation of the metaphor slightly misses the point of monads. Maybe this is what has raised the irritation here. The point of monads is that nothing is ever unpacked, i.e. the waste processor goes ''into'' the container (going into means lifting &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; m b&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;m a -&gt; m (m b)&lt;/code&gt;), processes the waste resulting in a new container inside the container. After that, the nested containers get flattened to single one (with &lt;code&gt; join :: m (m b) -&gt; m b&lt;/code&gt;). This way, the hole processing steps happens inside a container and no radioactive material ever leaks outside. Of course, the metaphorical problem is now &quot;why do I have processors that pack the waste into containers &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; m b&lt;/code&gt;? I mean, I can process the waste with &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; and leave out the extra flattening step&lt;code&gt;m (m a) -&gt; m a&lt;/code&gt;?&quot;. Well, the answer in &quot;real world&quot; is that some functions like &lt;code&gt;readFile :: FilePath -&gt; IO String&lt;/code&gt; do magical things with the &lt;code&gt;FilePath&lt;/code&gt;. Perhaps, the solution is to modify the metaphor: we glue container and waste together in the monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; and retain &quot;pure&quot; types &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. This way, &lt;code&gt;readFile&lt;/code&gt; takes a precious value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and returns a precious value &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, but unfortunately produces nuclear waste as a side effect so we only get &lt;code&gt;m b&lt;/code&gt; which is tainted forever. But thanks to &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt;, we can still operate with the stuff inside tightly sealed containers. -- [[User:Apfelmus|&lt;font color=&quot;lime&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;p&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;f&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#770077&quot;&gt;m&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;u&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;s&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:Now the next question is why we don't have container-container factories... and for that I have two answers.  The first is &quot;well, if we can get by just wrapping the output, why make life any more complicated than that?&quot;.  The second answer is that, well there ''is'' a different abstraction called arrows, which sort of looks like that; but I still don't understand them well enough to say more.  It just turns out that if we drop down from the metaphor in to the real world of Haskell hacking, monads are pretty darn useful by themselves (consider Maybe and List).

:Finally, I'd suggest you check out sigfpe's excellent &quot;You Could Have Invented Monads&quot;, which presents a very down-to-earth non-metaphorical approach, that works with you to re-invent the monads concept without even noticing it.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 20:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

::Yes, Kowey, it's indeed the lack of symmetry in the metaphor/programming concept that haunts me. And the explanation &quot;asymmetric is good enough to do the job&quot; is not satisfying ;-) Maybe I could be happier with another similar metaphor, like &quot;the processor always attaches a pouch with documentation to its output&quot;... I need to mull over it some more.

::I've read sigfpe's article, and honestly I find the concept of &quot;debuggable functions&quot; of the kind '''f :: Float -&gt; (Float,String)''' no less irritating than asymmetric nuclear waste processors. Oh well... --[[User:Crosser|Crosser]] 13:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Crosser, try this one on for size.  In fact, we very well ''could'' have symmetrical functions (taking containers in and spitting them back out).  Since all the containment business is taken care of, we can then sequence them by using our old friend, the &lt;code&gt;€&lt;/code&gt; operator:
 cf € cg € ch

:::Great!  Ok, so we don't need any complicated robots to control what happens between each function (dollar or euro do the trick just fine).  So what happens ''within'' the function?  In most cases, it's not very useful for us to be processing the container; we want to get at the stuff that's inside the container, right?  It turns out that the mechanism we invent for getting the stuff out of the container is going to be a bit of boilerplate code.  Because we're diligent programmers, we're going to &quot;factor out&quot; the boring code, separating each function &lt;code&gt;cf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt; into a boring end and its core business logic.  &lt;code&gt;cf&lt;/code&gt; then becomes something like &lt;code&gt;(boring f)&lt;/code&gt;; likewise, &lt;code&gt;cg&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;(boring g)&lt;/code&gt; and so forth.  Oh wait a second, what's this &lt;code&gt;boring&lt;/code&gt; function we introduce then?  It turns out that this is ''exactly'' the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; operator from this chapter.  The code from our symmetrical model of computation would then look something like this:
 (&gt;&gt;= f) € (&gt;&gt;= g) € (&gt;&gt;= h)

:::And if we wanted to use this, we'd still have to have a function that wraps something into a container:
 return x € (&gt;&gt;= f) € (&gt;&gt;= g) € (&gt;&gt;= h)

:::So that's fine, and maybe there is some kind of use for it.  But in many cases, this is just a lot of extra cruft, so we can just do away with the 'front' end container and use &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; directly, thus making the code a lot lighter-weight:
 return x &gt;&gt;= f &gt;&gt;= g &gt;&gt;= h

:::Is this any more convincing? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

::::Yes, Kowey, I understand the explanation. Still, even more, I am beginning to think that the ugliness (as perceived by myself) of the monad concept is the penalty for the attempt to shove side effects into purely functional paradigm. I found [http://kawagner.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-monads-are-evil.html this post] rather in line with my subconscious impressions.

:::: Thank you for discussion and explanations, anyway, they where very educative. --[[User:Crosser|Crosser]] 14:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

::::: Thanks for the link. One thing I can point out is the usefulness of monads goes far beyond IO.  While IO may the first place we encounter monads, Haskellers eventually discover (1) the usefulness of Maybe and List monad in real-life code (2) monadic parser combinator libraries [Parsec] (3) combining monads together with  transformers (4) generic functions that work on ''any'' monad.  Point being that it would not do to restrict our view of monads on IO or side-effects; there's much more fun to be had than that!  In any case, happy travels.  I hope you find what you're looking for either in Haskell or another language. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:43, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== I miss the point with (€) and sequencing ==

The section introducing (€) ends with 'Nevertheless, this notion of &quot;sequencing&quot; is basically 1/3 of the story behind monads'.
I don't get what is ment with 'notion of sequencing'. In a strict language I had no problem identifying nested function 
application with sequencing. But Haskell expression are evaluated lazily and that confuses me a bit.
If you consider the expression 'do_some_logging € print_current_time' then there is no guarantee, that do_some_logging is evaluated
before print_current_time. What am I missing here?

:Hi, the 'sequencing' does not refer to execution order at all.  Here it is just a case that the result of one in the pipeline is used in the next, instead of the other way around (in functional languages, we have 'backwards' pipelines).  The point is merely that we write it as &lt;code&gt;a € b € c € d&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;d $ c $ b $ a&lt;/code&gt;.  Same execution order in the end (afaik), just defined in a more familiar way.  I wouldn't read too much into it.  &lt;code&gt;(€)&lt;/code&gt; just makes things look different wrt ($), but that is all. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:18, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

::Thank you very much for your prompt answer! Let me also say, this tutorial is great! It helped me a lot to understand all the type signatures used in monadic frameworks. In the meanwhile I also found the [[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside IO inside]] tutorial, in which chapter 3 discusses how the intended execution order emerges in the case of the IO monad, which to understand was my main concern for a long time.


== Unhappy customers ==

For people who want more than a superficial explanation, this tutorial is very very bad:

* [http://ahamsandwich.wordpress.com/2007/07/26/monads-and-why-monad-tutorials-are-all-awful/ Monads! And Why Monad Tutorials are All Awful]
* see #haskell discussion (with Cale) on badness of wikibook monads tutorial - the nuclear waste metaphor is also bad because the dangerous bit (nuclear waste) is on the inside! (I would say &quot;can we bring space suits back&quot;, but I think there is a point somewhere that this use of metaphor might be bad)
* see [[User:Crosser|Crosser]]'s helpful remarks above (the notion is irritating)
* people complain that the $/€ thing is confusing...
* the writing is very clumsy ([[User:Kowey|Kowey]]); a small part of the problem is that I got into my head that we shouldn't use you/I (and use more we instead), but that was severely misguided because I ended up making things even worse in the process
* [[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]] points out that we're missing the point slightly about the &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; stuff (right?); the two container image

It's important that we get this one right, because this is '''the''' Haskell &quot;thing&quot;.  So feel free to be Really Really Bold.  Maybe replace it with the sigfpe tutorial? (note: Crosser cautions that he found the 'debuggable function' idea 'no less irritating').  Maybe wait to see what Cale can cook up? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:08, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

:I concur. Here's further analysis
:* Concerning the metaphor, its goal is to enforce the mental picture that there cannot be a function &lt;code&gt;extract :: m a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. removing the container will result in a radioactive disaster, removing the space suit will kill the astronaut. Thus, the metaphor can be ''very helpful'' in removing the mental block of &quot;why do I need such strange operations like &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; when I have &lt;code&gt;extract&lt;/code&gt;?&quot;. The bad thing about the waste metaphor is that the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;m a&lt;/code&gt; gets the negative connotation &quot;nuclear waste&quot;. Why would I want to process that?
:* The bad thing about metaphors in general is that they fail to explain the why/purpose/usefulness of monads. I mean, a metaphor is just a silly mental game you can play.
:* Personally, I learned monads with the &quot;metaphor&quot; &lt;code&gt;IO a = World -&gt; (a, World)&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed a very useful monad :-) and the need to hide the &lt;code&gt;World&lt;/code&gt; naturally leads to &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;. Only after that, I learned that containers like &lt;code&gt;[a]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; support the same structure.
:* However, a point that sometimes/often goes unnoticed when having &quot;monads = sequencing actions&quot; or &quot;monads = reprogram the semicolon&quot; in mind is that sequencing actions means to feed the results of one action to the next one. Sequencing alone can be done with any monoid. I once encountered this in [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/24549/focus=24572 Re: Practical Haskell question]. Note that imperative programming languages don't feed results of one action to the next ones, a monoid is enough for them! Instead, they use variable assignments like &lt;code&gt;a := a+1&lt;/code&gt; to memorize &quot;results&quot; of previous actions. In other words, you can't &quot;reprogram the semicolon&quot; from &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt; to say &lt;code&gt;[a]&lt;/code&gt; in C because of this stupid way to &quot;return&quot; results. Put differently, &lt;code&gt;a := a+1&lt;code&gt; is very different from &lt;code&gt;do { a &lt;- a+1 }&lt;/code&gt;.
:* Concerning style, I think that many parts of the wikibooks are affected, the standard textbook tone is we/passive voice. Fortunately, I think that there are two simple principles for writing high quality texts. Unfortunately, the principles are: ''Invest a lot of time'' and ''Know (or learn) much more about the subject than you actually write down''.

Just dashing off a quick note to say how relieved I am to see your two succinct/accurate notes about the purpose of the metaphor (and its potential inappropriateness).  You have hit the nail on the head on the pedagogical dilemma I was facing: how to isolate the 'how' from the 'why'.  My problem (premondial eric) was that I would really stumble over the 'how' part, because the 'why' part was never really clear to me.  So my hope was the metaphor would let us liberate one from the other.  Give the user a convenient substitute for understanding why, so that they can focus on the 'how'.  Only when they are comfortable with the sort of basic mechanics do we move it to a deeper level, so goes the thinking.  Of course, the problem is that I never really moved on, never gave the 'real why'.  Anyway, I'm perfectly happy to get rid of the metaphor, if the person doing it understands the 'mental block' problem as well as you do :-D -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:15, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

: Oh, I actually like the space-suit metaphor :-) so I wouldn't discard it.
: But I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to introduce the 'how', i.e. the abstract notions &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt;, before introducing the 'why', i.e. useful examples. [http://sigfpe.blogspot.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html You could have invented Monads] does the opposite, it introduces the 'why' before the 'how', apparently with big success. Personally, I too prefer the latter style. And Simon Peyton Jones says on slide 14 of [http://wit.tuwien.ac.at/events/peyton-jones/Giving%20a%20talk.pdf How to give a great research talk]: &quot;(When time is short,) omit the general case, not the example&quot; :-)
: Which example to choose for the 'why' before the 'how'? I'd choose &lt;code&gt;World -&gt; (a, World) = IO a&lt;/code&gt; since this is the one type that requires the programmer to know what a monad is, the other monads are more or less optional. It makes abstract &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; necessary, in the sense that there is no way to implicitely code them by hand and thereby miss the abstraction behind. I mean, there is &lt;code&gt;\x-&gt;[x]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;concatMap&lt;/code&gt; for lists but who would think that these two innocent functions are part of a greater conspiracy.
: I'd also explain monadic parser combinators &lt;code&gt;String -&gt; [(a,String)]&lt;/code&gt; in detail, they are a must for any solid book about monads :-) But probably in a separate chapter.

::: I was thinking of something else when I meant 'why', I don't remember people trying to explain the fundamental &quot;point&quot; before I even really knew what they were talking about.  'Why' via concrete examples sounds like a good idea.  I also like Cale's [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monads_as_computation Monads as Computation] from two days ago which pointed out all the handy little functions like &lt;code&gt;mapM&lt;/code&gt; (something which I hardly even knew about when I wrote the 1st version of space suits!) Good luck on the rewrite.  I'll be cheering on the sidelines. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:12, 3 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mechanics of Adding References==
I'm still learning the mechanics of adding references, so there are minor formatting problems with some of them. IN addition, it is taking a long time to add references because I am doing them one at a time. To save time after this first chapter, I am thinking about constructing a single list of references which I could paste into a Wiki page as a group. Since I already have the master list of references, it would be easy to transfer them to a special Wiki page called something like &quot;References&quot;.

References from a a subsection could then cross-reference to this &quot;master&quot; list of references. I'm assuming that this will be possible since cross-referencing among pages within a book is possible (and supposed to be easy), but I haven't tried it yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''When my son Michael was old enough to talk, and being an eager but naïve dad, I decided to bring Michael to my educational psychology class to demonstrate to my students “how children learn.” In one task I poured water from a tall drinking glass to a wide glass pie plate, which according to Michael changed the “amount” of water—there was less now that it was in the pie plate. I told that him that, on the contrary, the amount of water had stayed the same whether it was in the glass or the pie plate. He looked at me a bit strangely, but complied with my point of view—agreeing at first that, yes, the amount had stayed the same. But by the end of the class session he had reverted to his original position: there was less water, he said, when it was poured into the pie plate compared to being poured into the drinking glass. So much for demonstrating “learning”''

:''Each year after that first visit to my students, while Michael was still a preschooler, I returned with him each year to my ed psych class to do the same “learning demonstrations.” And each year Michael came along happily, but would again fail the task about the drinking glass and the pie plate. He would comply briefly if I “suggested” that the amount of water stayed the same no matter which way it was poured, but in the end he would still assert that the amount had changed. He was not learning this bit of conventional knowledge, in spite of my repeated efforts.''

:''But the year he turned six, things changed. When I told him it was time to visit my ed psych class again, he readily agreed and asked, “Are you going to ask me about the water in the drinking glass and pie plate again?” I said yes, I was indeed planning to do that task again. “That’s good,” he responded, “because I know that the amount stays the same even after you pour it. But do you want me to fake it this time? For your students’ sake?”''

In some ways what Michael did demonstrate ''learning'', but not in other ways. He did ''not'' learn that the amount of water stayed constant just because I told him to, but he ''did'' learn to comply with my requests to display a particular belief about the water. The key feature identifying true learning--both for Michael and the rest of us--is its permanence: the change in behavior, skill, or knowledge had to last. You do not “learn” a phone number if you forget it the minute after you dial the number; you do not “learn” to eat vegetables if you only do it when forced. The change has to persist. Notice, though, that learning can be physical, social, or emotional as well as cognitive. You do not “learn” to sneeze simply by catching cold, but you ''do'' learn many skills and behaviors that are physically based, such as riding a bicycle or throwing a ball. You can also learn to like (or dislike) a person, even though this change may not happen deliberately.

==Teachers’ Perspectives on Learning==
For teachers, learning usually refers to things that happen in schools or classrooms, even though every teacher can of course describe examples of learning that happen outside of these places. Even Michael, at age six, had begun realizing that what counted as “learning” in his dad’s educator-type mind was something that happened in a classroom, under the supervision of a teacher (me). For me, as for many educators, the term has a more specific meaning than for many people less involved in schools. In particular, teachers’ perspectives on learning often emphasize three ideas, and sometimes even take them for granted: 1) curriculum content and academic achievement, 2) sequencing and readiness, and 3) the importance of transferring learning to new or future situations.
===Dependence of Learning on Curriculum===
When teachers speak of learning, they tend to emphasize whatever is taught in schools deliberately, including both the official curriculum and the various behaviors and routines that make classrooms run smoothly. In practice, defining learning in this way often means that teachers equate learning with the major forms of academic achievement—especially language and mathematics—and to a lesser extent musical skill, physical coordination, or social sensitivity (Gardner, 1999, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1999). ''Intelligence reframed: Multiple intelligences for the 21st century.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (2006). ''The development and education of the mind.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. The imbalance occurs not because the goals of public education make teachers responsible for certain content and activities (like books and reading) and the skills which these activities require (like answering teachers’ questions and writing essays). It does happen not (thankfully!) because teachers are biased, insensitive, or unaware that students often learn a lot outside of school.

A side effect of focusing learning on curriculum and academics is that classroom social interactions and behaviors become issues for teachers—become something that they need to manage. In particular, having dozens of students in one room makes it more likely that I, as a teacher, think of “learning” as something that either takes concentration (to avoid being distracted by others) or that benefits from collaboration (to take advantage of their presence). In the small space of a classroom, no other viewpoint about social interaction makes sense. Yet in the wider world outside of school, learning often does happen incidentally, “accidentally” and without conscious interference or input from others: I “learn” what a friend’s personality is like, for example, without either of us deliberately trying to make this happen. As teachers, we sometimes see incidental learning in classrooms as well, and often welcome it; but our responsibility for curriculum goals more often focuses our efforts on what students can learn through conscious, deliberate effort. In a classroom, unlike in many other human settings, it is always necessary to ask whether classmates are helping or hindering individual students’ learning.

===Dependence of Learning on Teaching===
Focusing learning on changes in classrooms has several other effects. One, for example, is that it can tempt teachers to think that what is taught is equivalent to what is learned—even though most teachers know that doing so is a mistake, and that teaching and learning can be quite different. If I assign a reading to my students about the Russian Revolution, it would be nice to assume not only that they have read the same words, but also learned the same content. But that assumption is not usually the reality. Some students may have read and learned all of what I assigned; others may have read everything but misunderstood the material or remembered only some of it; and still others, unfortunately, may have neither read nor learned much of anything. Chances are that my students would confirm this picture, if asked confidentially. There are ways, of course, to deal helpfully with such diversity of outcomes; for suggestions, see Part 2 (“Instruction and Assessment”) and especially Chapter 9 (“Planning Instruction”) and Chapter 10 (“Teacher-Made Assessment Strategies”). But whatever instructional strategies I adopt, they cannot include assuming that what I teach is the same as what students understand or retain of what I teach.

===Sequencing and Readiness===
The distinction between teaching and learning creates a secondary issue for teachers, that of educational readiness. Traditionally the concept referred to students’ preparedness to cope with or profit from the activities and expectations of school. A kindergarten child was “ready” to start school, for example, if he or she was in good health, showed moderately good social skills, could take care of personal physical needs (like eating lunch or going to the bathroom unsupervised), could use a pencil to make simple drawings, and so on. [[../Table 1/]] shows a similar set of criteria for determining whether a child is “ready” to learn to read (Copple &amp; Bredekamp, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Copple, C. &amp; Bredekamp, S. (2006). ''Basics of developmentally appropriate practice.'' Washington, D.C.: National Association for the Education of Young Children.&lt;/ref&gt;. At older ages (such as in high school or university), the term readiness is often replaced by a more specific term, prerequisites. To take a course in physics, for example, a student must first have certain prerequisite experiences, such as studying advanced algebra or calculus. To begin work as a public school teacher, a person must first engage in practice teaching for a period of time (not to mention study educational psychology!).

Note that this traditional meaning, of readiness as preparedness, focuses attention on students’ adjustment to school and away from the reverse: the possibility that schools and teachers also have responsibility for adjusting to students. But the latter idea is in fact a legitimate, second meaning for '''readiness''': If five-year-old children normally need to play a lot and keep active, then it is fair to say that their kindergarten teacher needs to be “ready” for this behavior by planning a program that allows a lot of play and physical activity. If she cannot do so (whatever the reason may be), then in a very real sense this failure is not the children’s responsibility. Among older students, the second, teacher-oriented meaning of readiness makes sense as well. If a teacher has a student with a disability (for example, the student is visually impaired), then the teacher has to adjust her approach in appropriate ways—not simply expect a visually impaired child to “sink or swim.” As you might expect, this sense of readiness is very important for special education, so I discuss it further in Chapter 5 (“Students with Special Educational Needs”). But the issue of readiness also figures importantly whenever students are diverse (which is most of the time), so it also comes up in Chapter 4 (“Student Diversity”).

===Transfer as a Crucial Part of Learning===
Still another result of focusing the concept of learning on classrooms is that it raises issues of usefulness or transfer, which is the ability to use knowledge or skill in situations beyond the ones in which they are acquired. Learning to read and learning to solve arithmetic problems, for example, are major goals of the elementary-school curriculum because those skills are meant to be used not only inside the classroom, but outside as well. We teachers intend, that is, for reading and arithmetic skills to “transfer”—even though we also do our best to make the skills enjoyable while they are still being learned. In the world inhabited by teachers, even more than in other worlds, making learning fun is certainly a good thing to do, but making learning useful as well as fun is even better. Combining enjoyment and usefulness, in fact, is a “gold standard” of teaching: we generally seek it for students, and even though we may not succeed at providing it all of the time.

==Major Theories and Models of Learning==
Several ideas and priorities, then, affect how we teachers think about learning, including the curriculum, the difference between teaching and learning, sequencing, readiness, and transfer. The ideas form a “screen” through which to understand and evaluate whatever psychology has to offer education. As it turns out, many theories, concepts, and ideas from educational psychology do make it through the “screen” of education, meaning that they are consistent with the professional priorities of teachers and helpful in solving important problems of classroom teaching. In the case of issues about classroom learning, for example, educational psychologists have developed a number of theories and concepts that are relevant to classrooms, in that they describe at least some of what usually happens there and offer guidance for assisting learning. It is helpful to group the theories according to whether they focus on changes in behavior or in thinking. The distinction is rough and inexact, but a good place to begin. For starters, therefore, consider two perspectives about learning, called '''behaviorism''' (learning as changes in overt behavior) and '''constructivism,''' (learning as changes in thinking). The second category can be further divided into ''psychological constructivism'' (changes in thinking resulting from individual experiences, and ''social constructivism,'' (changes in thinking due to assistance from others). The rest of this chapter describes key ideas from each of these viewpoints. As I hope you will see, each describes some aspects of learning not just in general, but as it happens in classrooms in particular. So each perspective suggests things that you might do in your classroom to make students’ learning more productive.
A third learning theory is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism connectivism]].

==Behaviorism: Changes in What Students Do==
'''Behaviorism''' is a perspective on learning that focuses on changes in individuals' observable behaviors--changes in what people say or do.... [[../Behaviorism: Changes in What Students Do/|(read more...)]]
:''Respondent Conditioning: Learning New Associations with Prior Behaviors''
:''Operant Conditioning: New Behaviors Because of New Consequences''

==Constructivism: Changes in How Students Think==
Behaviorist models of learning may be helpful in understanding and influencing what students do, but teachers usually also want to know what students are thinking, and want to enrich what they are thinking. For this aspect of teaching, some of the best help comes from '''constructivism,''' which is a perspective on learning focused on how students actively create (or “construct”) knowledge out of experiences. [[../Constructivism: Changes in How Students Think/|(read more...)]]

==Chapter Summary==
Although the term learning has many possible meanings, the term as used by teachers emphasizes its relationship to curriculum, to teaching, and to the issues of sequencing, readiness, and transfer. Viewed in this light, the two major psychological perspectives of learning—behaviorist and constructivist—have important ideas to offer educators. Within the behaviorist perspective are two major theories or models of learning, called respondent conditioning and operant conditioning. Respondent conditioning describes how previously neutral associations can acquire the power to elicit significant responses in students. Operant conditioning describes how the consequences and cues for a behavior can cause the behavior to become more frequent. In either case, from a teacher’s point of view, the learned behaviors or responses can be either desirable or unwanted.

The other major psychological perspective—constructivism—describes how individuals build or “construct” knowledge by engaging actively with their experiences. The psychological version of constructivism emphasizes the learners’ individual responses to experience—their tendency both to assimilate it and to accommodate to it. The social version of constructivism emphasizes how other, more expert individuals can create opportunities for the learner to construct new knowledge. Social constructivism suggests that a teacher’s role must include deliberate instructional planning, such as facilitated by Bloom’s taxonomy of learning objectives, but also that teachers need to encourage metacognition, which is students’ ability to monitor their own learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''When I was growing up, for good or for ill, I was provided piano lessons. Daily practice was a staple of my childhood, 365 days a year, along with a home that deliberately kept quiet to facilitate practice. Music—especially the piano—defined a major part of “me,” Kelvin Seifert. Altogether I studied piano for 13 years, from age 4 to the end of high school, with only occasional brief interruptions.''

:''At any one time, I witnessed small changes in my skills. I performed a simple piece a bit better than I had the previous week, or I played a bit more of it from memory. There were direct, obvious connections between my skills at one moment and at the moment just before or after. Back then, if you had asked me then what accounted for the changes, I would have stated without hesitation that they were because I was “learning” specific piano pieces.''

:''Across broader spans of time, however, I noticed more dramatic changes. I learned much more complex pieces than I had a few years earlier, for example. I played with more “finesse,” sensitivity and polish than when I had as a young child. I was even listening to classical music on the radio some of the time!  My musical talent had been transformed since I had begun, and in some sense was not the “same” talent that I had had as a beginner.''

:''If you had asked me what accounted for these longer-term changes, I would have had a harder time answering than when asked about the short-term changes. I might have said simply and a bit vaguely that “I have been getting better at piano.” If you ask me the same question now, however, I would say that my music skills had developed, that their development had taken years, and that the changes resulted not just from simply practicing, but also from becoming generally more mature.''
        
[[w:Developmental psychology|Development]] refers to long-term personal changes that have multiple sources and multiple effects. It is like the difference between my music at fifteen compared to my music at five, rather than the difference between one week and the next. Some human developments are especially broad and take years to unfold fully, like a child’s ever-evolving ability to “read” other people’s emotions and moods. Others are faster and may be more specific or focused, like a child’s increasing ability to solve crossword puzzles. The faster and simpler it is, the more likely we are to call the change “learning” instead of development. It is a matter of degree. When I learned to name the planets of the solar system, for example, I did not need a lot of time, nor did the learning involve a multitude of experiences. So it is probably better to think of that particular experience—learning the names of the planets—as learning rather than of development (Salkind, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Salkind, N. (2004). Theories of Human Development. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Why Development Matters==
Students’ development matters for teachers, but the way it matters depends on the kind of teaching. If you teach a single, “self-contained” grade-level, then the benefits of knowing about development will be less explicit, but just as real, as if you teach many grade levels. Working exclusively with one grade (like, say, a third-grade classroom) highlights differences among students that happen in spite of their similar ages, and obscures similarities that happen because of their having similar ages. Under these conditions it is easy to notice students’ diversity, but somewhat harder to know how much of it comes from differences in their long-term development, as opposed to differences in shorter-term learning or immediate experiences. Yet this knowledge is useful in planning appropriate activities and in holding appropriate expectations about students. What changes can you expect to happen relatively soon simply from your current program of activities, and which ones might not show up this year at all? These are questions that developmental psychology can help to answer.

If you teach multiple grade levels, as often happens to specialists or to teachers in middle school or high school, then your need for developmental knowledge will be more obvious because you will confront wide age differences on a daily basis. As a physical education teacher, for example, you may teach kindergarten children as well as sixth-graders, or seventh-graders as well as twelfth-graders, all in the course of a single day, or even of a single hour. Diversity among your students will therefore be a more explicit mix of the developmental and non-developmental—of complex differences due to age as well as differences due to “other” factors, such as skills or knowledge learned only recently. Nonetheless, your instructional challenge will be the same as the one faced by teachers of single-grade classes: you will want to know what activities and expectations are appropriate for your students. To answer this question, you will need to know something not only about your students, but also about general developmental trends during childhood and adolescence.

Note that developmental trends vary in two important ways. The first, as I indicated already, is in their generality. Some theories or models of development boldly assert that certain changes happen universally—happen, that is, to virtually every person on the planet. For example, a theory might assert that virtually every toddler acquires a spoken language, or that every teenager forms a sense of personal identity. Individuals who do not experience these developments would be very rare as well as significantly disabled, no matter what family, community, or society they belong to. Other theories, however, propose developmental changes that are more limited in scope, claiming only that the changes happen to some people and only under certain conditions. Developing a female gender role, for example, does not happen to everyone, but only to the female part of the population, and the process differs according to the family, community, or society in which a child lives.

The second way that developmental trends vary is in how strictly they are sequenced and hierarchical. In some views about development, changes are thought to happen in a specific order and to build on each other—sort of a “staircase” model of development (Case, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1991). ''The Mind's Staircase.'' Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, a developmental psychologist (and many of the rest of us, for that matter) might argue that young people must have tangible, hands-on experience with new materials before they can reason about the materials in the abstract. The order cannot be reversed. In other viewpoints, developmental change happens, but not in a uniform sequence or with a common end point; change is more of a “kaleidoscope” than a staircase (Lewis, 1997; Harris, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. (1997). ''Altering fate: Why the past does not predict the future.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J. (2006). ''No two alike: Human nature and human individuality.'' New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;. A person who becomes permanently disabled, for example, may experience complex long-term changes in personal values and priorities. But the changes can in principle happen at any time during life, including childhood, and can take a variety of forms.

Except in the realm of physical development, educational psychologists have tended to emphasize explanations of development that are relatively general, universal and sequential, rather than specific to particular cultures or “merely” kaleidoscopic (see, for examples, Woolfolk, 2006, Chapters 2 and 3&lt;ref&gt;Woolfolk, A. (2006). ''Educational psychology, 10th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;or Slavin, 2005, Chapters 2 and 3ref&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. (2005). ''Educational psychology, 6th edition.&quot; Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;). Such models (sometimes called “grand theories”) have the advantages of concisely integrating many features of development, while also describing where “typical” children or adolescents end up in life. The preference for integrative perspectives makes sense given educators’ need to work with and teach large numbers of diverse students both efficiently and effectively. But the approach also risks overgeneralizing or oversimplifying what happens to particular children and youth. It can also confuse what does happen as certain children (like the middle-class ones) develop with what should happen to all children. To understand these risks, imagine any two children of about the same age who have clearly had very different experiences—for example, one child who grows up in poverty and another who grows up financially well-off. In what sense can we say that these two children experience the same underlying developmental changes as they grow up? And how much should they even be expected to? Developmental psychology, and especially the broad theories of it emphasized in educational psychology, highlights the “sameness” or common ground between these two children as they mature, no matter how different they seem on the surface. Developmental knowledge, then, serves as counterpoint or balance to knowledge of the obvious complementary reality of teaching, diversity among students.

==Physical Development during the School Years==
Although it may be tempting to think that physical development is the concern of physical education specialists, many aspects of it are actually quite relevant to other teachers as well. In first-grade, for example, it is important to know whether children can successfully manipulate a pencil. In later grades, it is important to know how long students can be expected to sit still without discomfort—actually a physical challenge itself. In all grades, it is important to have a sense of students’ health needs related to their age or maturity, if only to know who is likely to become ill with what illness, and what physical activities are reasonable and needed. 

===Trends in Height and Weight===
Typical growth in students’ height and weight are easy to summarize and are shown in [[Figure 3-1]]. The figure shows not only the average for each age from preschool through the end of high school, but also the range within which 90% of children fall for each age. At age 6, for example, about when most children begin school, the average boy or girl is about 45 ½ inches tall, but 90% of six year olds are between about 43 and 49 inches tall. Average weight at the same age is about 39 pounds, but ranges between about 35 and 53 pounds.
        
There are two important points to keep in mind about [[Figure 3-1]]. The first is that boys and girls are quite similar in height and weight during childhood, but diverge in the early teen-age years, when they reach puberty. For a time (approximately age 10-14), the average girl is taller, but not much heavier, than the average boy. After that the average boy becomes both taller and heavier than the average girl—though there remain individual exceptions (Malina, et al., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Malina, R., Bouchard, C., &amp; Bar-Or, O. (2004). ''Growth, maturation, and physical activity.'' Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The preteen difference can be especially awkward for some children and youth, at least among those who aspire to looking like older teenagers or young adults. For young teens less concerned with “image,” though, the fact that girls are taller may not be especially important, or even noticed (Friedman, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, S. (2000). ''When girls feel fat: Helping girls through adolescence.'' Toronto: Firefly Books.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The second point about [[Figure 3-1]] is that as children get older, individual differences in weight diverge more radically than differences in height. Among 18-year-olds, the heaviest youngsters weigh almost twice as much as the lightest, but the tallest ones are only about 10% taller than the shortest. Nonetheless, both height and weight can be sensitive issues for some teenagers. Society (and therefore teenage peers) tends to favor relatively short women and tall men, as well as a thin body build, especially for girls and women. Yet neither “socially correct” height nor thinness is the destiny for many individuals. Being overweight, in particular, has become a common, serious problem in modern society (Tartamella, et al., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Tartamella, L., Herscher, E., Woolston, C. (2004). ''Generation extra large: Rescuing our children from the obesity epidemic.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;, due to the prevalence of diets high in sugar and trans fats and lifestyles low in activity. The educational system has unfortunately contributed to the problem as well, by gradually restricting the number of physical education courses and classes in the past two decades.

===Puberty and Its Effects on Students===
The most universal physical development in students is puberty, which is the set of changes in early adolescence that bring about sexual maturity. Along with internal changes in reproductive organs are outward changes, such as growth of breasts in girls and of the penis in boys, as well as relatively sudden increases in height and weight. By about age 10 or 11, most children experience increased sexual attraction to others (usually heterosexual, though not always) that can affect social life both in school and elsewhere (McClintock &amp; Herdt, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;McLintock, M. &amp; Herdt, g. (1996). Rethinking puberty: The development of sexual attraction. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 5,'' 178-183.&lt;/ref&gt;. By the end of high school, more than half of boys and girls report having experienced sexual intercourse at least once—though it is hard to be certain of the proportion because of the personal sensitivity of the information (Rosenbaum, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, J. (2006). Reborn a virgin: Adolescents' Retracting of virginity pledges and sexual histories. ''American Journal of Public Health, 96''(6), pp. xxx-yyy&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition to creating obvious physical differences, puberty accentuates gender role differences for at least some teenagers. Girls who excelled at math or science in elementary school may curb some of their enthusiasm for and displays of success at these subjects (Taylor, Gilligan, &amp; Sullivan, 1995; Sadker, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, L., Gilligan, C. (1995). ''Between voice and silence: Women and girls, race and relationship.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadker, M. (2004). Gender equity in the classroom. In M. Kimmel (Ed.), ''The gendered society reader, 2nd edition.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Boys who previously were not especially interested in sports may feel a new need to dedicate themselves to athletics in order to affirm their masculinity in the eyes of others. Individual boys and girls who might have once worked together successfully on class projects may no longer feel comfortable doing so—or alternatively may now want to work together for non-academic rather than academic reasons. Such changes do not affect all youngsters equally, nor affect any one youngster equally on all occasions. An individual student may act like a young adult on one day, but more like a child on the next. In teaching children who are  in the midst of puberty (especially early in the process), you will need to respond flexibly and supportively.

===Development of Motor Skills===

Students’ fundamental motor skills are already developing when they begin kindergarten, but are still not yet perfectly coordinated. Five-year-olds generally can walk satisfactorily for most school-related purposes (if they could not, the schools would have to be organized very differently!). For some fives, running still looks a bit like a hurried walk, but usually it becomes more coordinated within a year or two. Similarly with jumping, throwing and catching: the large majority of children can do these things, though often a bit clumsily, by the time they start school, and most improve their skills noticeably during the early elementary years (Payne &amp; Isaacs, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Payne, V. &amp; Isaacs, L. (2005). ''Human motor development: A lifespan approach, 6th edition.'' Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Figure 3-2]] summarizes the changes for two basic skills, throwing and jumping. Assisting these developments is usually the job of physical education specialists, where they exist, or else of classroom teachers when classroom teachers lead their own physical education lessons. Whoever is responsible should also notice if and when a child does not keep more-or-less to this developmental timetable, and arrange for special remediation or other help that may be appropriate. Some common procedures for doing so are described in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs|Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs]].

Whether or not physical skills become a special focus of teachers’ concern, however, they can be quite important to students themselves. Whatever their grade level, students who are clumsy are aware of that fact and of its potentially negative effect on peer relationships. In the long term, self-consciousness and poor self-esteem can result for a child who is clumsy, especially if peers (or teachers and parents) place high value on participation in athletics. One research study confirmed, for example, what teachers and coaches sometimes suspect: that losers in athletic competitions tend to become less sociable and are more apt to miss athletic practices than winners (Petlichkoff, 1996) &lt;ref&gt;Petlichkoff, L. (1996). The drop-out dilemma in youth sports. In O. Bar-Or (Ed.), ''The child and adolescent athlete'' (pp. 418-432). Oxford, UK: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Health and Illness===

By world standards, children and youth in the United States and other developed societies tend to be remarkably healthy, though much depends on how well-off their families are and on how much health care is available to them. Children from middle- and higher-income families experience far fewer serious or life-threatening illnesses than children whose families lack resources.  All across the economic spectrum, however, parents and teachers often rightly note that children—especially the youngest ones—get far more minor illnesses than do adults. In 2004, for example, one government survey estimated that children get an average of 6-10 colds per year, but adults get only about 2-4 per year (National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, 2005) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niaid.nih.gov/facts/cold.htm National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. ''The common cold.'']&lt;/ref&gt;. The difference probably exists because children’s immune systems are not as fully formed as adults’, while at the same time children are continually exposed to others at school, many of whom may be contagious themselves. An indirect result of children’s frequent illnesses is that teachers (along with airline flight attendants, incidentally) also report more frequent minor illnesses than do adults in general—about five colds per year, for example, instead of just 2-4 (Whelen, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Whelen, E., et al. (2003). Prevalence of respiratory symptoms among female flight attendants and teachers. ''Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 60,'' 929-934.&lt;/ref&gt;. These “simple” illnesses are responsible for many lost days of school, both for students and for teachers, as well as many days when a student is present physically, but functions below par and simultaneously infects classmates. Learning, and often also teaching, therefore suffer because health is suffering.

The problem is not only the prevalence of illness as such (in the United States in winter, approximately one person gets infected with a minor illness every few seconds), but the fact that illnesses are not distributed uniformly among students, schools, or communities. Whether it is a simple cold or something more serious, illness is particularly common where living conditions are crowded, where health care is scarce or unaffordable, and where individuals live with frequent stresses of any kind. Often, but not always, these are the circumstances of poverty. [[Table 3-1]] summarizes these economic effects for a variety of health problems, not just for colds or flu.
      
As students get older and become teenagers, illnesses become less frequent, but other health risks emerge. The most widespread is the consumption of alcohol and the smoking of cigarettes. As of 2004, about 75% of teenagers reported drinking an alcoholic beverage at least occasionally, and 22% reported smoking cigarettes (Center for Disease Control, 2004a)&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control. (2004b). ''National survey on drug use and health.'' Bethesda, MD: Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;. The good news about these figures is that they are part of a small, but steady decline in the frequencies over the past ten years or so. The bad news is that teenagers also show increases in the abuse of some prescription drugs, such as inhalants, that act as stimulants (Johnston, et al., 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, L., et al. (2006). ''Monitoring the future: National results on adolescent drug use.'' Bethesda, MD: National Institute on Drug Abuse.&lt;/ref&gt;. As with the prevalence of illnesses, the prevalence of drug use is not uniform, with a relatively small fraction of individuals accounting for a disproportionate proportion of usage. One survey, for example, found that a teenager was 3-5 times more likely to smoke or to use alcohol, smoke marijuana, or use drugs if he or she has a sibling who has also indulged these habits (Fagan &amp; Najman, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, A. &amp; Najman, J. (2005). The relative contribution of parental and sibling substance use to adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. ''Journal of Drug Issues, 35,'' 869-883,&lt;/ref&gt;. Siblings, according to the research, seem to be more influential as role models than parents.

==Cognitive Development: The Theory of Jean Piaget==
'''Cognition''' refers to thinking and memory processes, and '''cognitive development''' refers to long-term changes in these processes. While cognition has been studied from several different perspectives and in the light of several theories, the one that is both the most widely known among educators and the most frankly &quot;developmental&quot; is the cognitive stage theory of a Swiss psychologist named '''Jean Piaget'''. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development/Cognitive Development: The Theory of Jean Piaget|(read more...)]]

==Social Development: Relationships and Personal Motives==
'''Social development''' refers to the long-term changes in relationships and interactions involving self, peers, and family. It includes both positive changes, such as how friendships develop, and negative changes, such as aggression or bullying...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development/Social Development: Relationships and Personal Motives|(read more...)]]

==Moral Development: Forming a Sense of Rights and Responsibilities==

==Understanding “The Typical Student” versus Understanding Students==

In this chapter I have often spoken of students in a generalized way, referring to “the” child, student, or youngster, as if a single typical or average individual exists and develops through single, predictable pathways. As every teacher knows, however, development is not that simple. A class of 25 or 30 students will contain 25 or 30 individuals who will be learning and developing along 25 or 30 distinct pathways. Why then study developmental patterns at all? Because underlying their obvious diversity, students do indeed show important similarities. This chapter has indicated what some of the similarities are and how they relate to the job of teaching. My references to “the” student should not be understood, therefore, as referring to simple-minded stereotypes, but to tendencies around which real, live students often group themselves. Pointing to developmental changes is like pointing to a flock of birds in flight: the flock has a general location, but individual birds also have their own locations and individual flight paths.

As a teacher, I believe that the most helpful approach is to understand development and diversity not separately, but jointly. There are indeed similarities woven among the differences in students, but also differences woven among students’ commonalities. It is best therefore to read this chapter on development together with the next one, which looks squarely at student diversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">::''I’ll tell you this: There are some people, and then there are others.''

::::''--Anna Maude Harris''

Anna Harris was my grandmother as well as a schoolteacher from about 1910 to 1930. Her comment, which she used to make about her students, makes a good theme for this chapter—and even for teaching in general. Students do differ in a multitude of ways, both individually and because of memberships in families, communities or cultural groups. Sometimes the differences can make classroom-style teaching more challenging, but other times, as Anna Harris implied, they simply enrich classroom life. To teach students well, we need to understand the important ways that they differ among themselves, and when or how the differences really matter for their education. This chapter offers some of that understanding and suggests how you might use it in order to make learning effective and enjoyable for everyone, including yourself.

For convenience I will make a major distinction between individual differences and group differences among students. As the term implies, individual differences are qualities that are unique; just one person has them at a time. Variation in hair color, for 
example, is an individual difference; even though some people have nearly the same hair color, no two people are exactly the same. Group differences are qualities shared by members of an identifiable group or community, but not shared by everyone in society. An example is gender role: for better or for worse, one portion of society (the males) is perceived differently and expected to behave a bit differently than another portion of society (the females). Notice that distinguishing between individual and group differences is sometimes convenient, but it is always a bit arbitrary. Individuals with similar, but nonetheless unique qualities sometimes group themselves together for certain purposes, and groups unusually contain a lot of individual diversity within them. If you happen to enjoy playing soccer and have some talent for it (an individual quality), for example, you are more likely than usual to end up as a member of a soccer team or club (a group defined by members’ desire and ability to play soccer). But though everyone on the team may fit 
a “soccer player’s profile” at some level, the team will probably also contain individuals with varying levels of skill and of motivation. The group, by its very nature, may tend to “hide” these signs of individuality.

To begin, then, I look at several differences normally considered to be individually rather than group based. This discussion will necessarily be incomplete, however, simply because individual differences so numerous and important in teaching that parts of the topic are also contained in later chapters (see also, for example, [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs|Chapter 5, &quot;Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;]] or [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies|Chapter 10]] and [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments|Chapter 11]] about assessment of learning). Later sections of the chapter deal with three important forms of group diversity: gender differences, cultural differences, and language differences.

===Individual Styles of Learning and Thinking===

All of us, including our students, have preferred ways of learning. Teachers often call these differences '''learning styles,''' though this term may imply more consistency across situations than is really the case. One student may like to make diagrams to help remember a reading assignment, whereas another student may prefer to write a sketchy outline instead. Yet in many cases the students could in principle reverse the strategies and still learn the material: if coaxed (or perhaps required), the diagram-maker could takes notes for a change and the note-taker could draw diagrams. Both might still learn using the alternate style, even if neither felt as comfortable as with the strategies they prefer.

This reality suggests that a balanced, middle-of-the-road approach may be a teacher’s best response to students’ learning styles. Or to put it another way: it is good to support students’ preferred learning strategies where possible and appropriate, but neither necessary nor desirable to do so all of the time (Loo, 2004; Stahl, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Loo, R. (2004). Kolb’s learning styles and learning preferences: Is there a linkage? ''Educational psychology,'' 24(1), 99-108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, S. (2002). Different strokes for different folks? In L. Abbeduto (Ed.), ''Taking sides: Clashing on controversial issues in educational psychology (pp. 98-107)''. Guilford, CT: McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of all, it is neither necessary nor possible to classify or label students according to seemingly fixed learning styles and then allow them to learn only according to those styles. A student may prefer to hear new material rather than see it; he may prefer for you to explain something orally, for example, rather than to see it demonstrated in a video. But he may nonetheless tolerate or sometimes even prefer to see it demonstrated. In the long run, in fact, he may learn it best by encountering the material in both ways, regardless of his habitual preferences.

That said, there is evidence that individuals, including students, do differ in how they habitually think. These differences are more specific than learning styles or preferences, and psychologists sometimes call them cognitive styles, meaning typical ways of perceiving and remembering information, and typical ways of solving problems and making decisions (Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, L. &amp; Sternberg, R. (2006). ''The nature of intellectual styles.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;. In a style of thinking called '''field dependence''', for example, individuals perceive patterns as a whole rather than focus on the parts of the pattern separately. In a complementary tendency, called '''field independence,''' individuals are more inclined to analyze overall patterns into their parts. 
Cognitive research from the 1940s to the present has found field 
dependence/independence differences to be somewhat stable for any given person across situations, though not completely so (Witkin, Moore, Goodenough, &amp; Cox, 1977; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Witkin, H., Moore, C., Goodenough, D., &amp; Cox, R. (1977). Field-dependent and field-independent cognitive styles and their educational implications. ''Review of Educational Research, 47,'' 1-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, L. &amp; Sternberg, R. (2005). Three-fold model of intellectual styles. ''Educational Psychology Review, 17''(1)&lt;/ref&gt;. Someone who is field dependent (perceives globally or 
“wholistically”) in one situation, that is, tends to a modest extent to perceive things globally or wholistically in other situations. Field dependence and independence can be important understanding students because the styles affect students’ behaviors and preferences in school and classrooms. Field dependent persons tend to work better in groups, it seems, and to prefer “open-ended” fields of study like literature and history. Field independent persons, on the other hand, tend to work better alone and to prefer 
highly analytic studies like math and science. The differences are only a tendency, however, and there are a lot of students who contradict the trends. As with the broader notion of learning styles, the cognitive styles of field dependence and independence are useful for tailoring instruction to particular students, but their guidance is only approximate. They neither can nor should be used to “lock” students to particular modes of learning or to replace students’ own expressed preferences and choices about 
curriculum.

Another cognitive style is '''impulsivity''' as compared to '''reflectivity'''. As the names imply, an impulsive cognitive style is one in which a person reacts quickly, but as a result makes comparatively more errors. A reflective style is the opposite: the person reacts more slowly and therefore makes fewer errors. As you might expect, the reflective style would seem better suited to many academic demands of school. Research has found that this is indeed the case for academic skills that clearly benefit from reflection, such as mathematical problem solving or certain reading tasks (Evans, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Evans, C. (2004). Exploring the relationship between cognitive style and teaching style. ''Educational psychology, 24''(4), 509-530&lt;/ref&gt;. Some classroom or school-related skills, however, may actually develop better if a student is relatively impulsive. Being a good partner in a cooperative learning group, for example, may depend partly on responding spontaneously (i.e. just a bit “impulsively”) to others’ suggestions; and being an effective member of an athletic team may depend on not taking time to reflect carefully on every move that you or your team mates make.

There are two major ways to use knowledge of students’ cognitive styles (Pritchard, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, A. (2005). ''Ways of learning: Learning theories and learning styles in the classroom.'' London, UK: David Fulton&lt;/ref&gt;. The first and the more obvious is to build on students’ existing style strengths and preferences. A student who is field independent and reflective, for example, can be encouraged to explore tasks and activities that are relatively analytic and that require relatively independent work. One who is field dependent and impulsive, on the other hand, can be encouraged and supported to try tasks and activities that are more social or spontaneous. But a second, less obvious way to use knowledge of cognitive styles is to encourage more balance in cognitive styles for students who need it. A student who lacks field independence, for example, my need explicit help in organizing and analyzing key academic tasks (like organizing a lab report in a science class). One who is already highly reflective may need encouragement to try ideas spontaneously, as in a creative writing lesson.

===Multiple Intelligences===

For nearly a century, educators and psychologists have debated the nature of intelligence, and more specifically whether intelligence is just one broad ability or can take more than one form. Many classical definitions of the concept have tended to define intelligence as a single broad ability that allows a person to solve or complete many sorts of tasks, or at least many academic tasks like reading, knowledge of vocabulary, and the solving of logical problems (Garlick, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Garlick, K. (2002). Understanding the nature of the general factor of intelligence. ''Psychological review, 109''(1), 116-136&lt;/ref&gt;. There is research evidence of such a global ability, and the idea of general intelligence often fits with society’s everyday beliefs about intelligence. Partly for these reasons, an entire mini-industry has grown up around publishing tests of intelligence, academic ability, and academic achievement. Since these tests affect the work of teachers, I return to discussing them later in this book, in Chapters 10 and 11.

But there are also problems with defining intelligence as one general ability (and the problems, too, are discussed in Chapters 10 and 11). One way of summing up the problems is to say that conceiving of intelligence as something general tends to put it beyond teachers’ influence. When viewed as a single, all-purpose  ability, students either have a lot of intelligence or they do not, and strengthening their intelligence becomes a major challenge, or perhaps even an impossible one (Gottfredson, 2004; Lubinski, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson, L. (2004). Intelligence: Is it the epidemiologists’ elusive “fundamental cause” of social class inequalities in health? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86''(1), 174-199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lubinski, D. (2004). 100 years after Spearman’s &quot;‘General Intelligence,’ Objectively Determined and Measured”. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86''(1), 96-111&lt;/ref&gt;. This conclusion is troubling to some educators, especially in recent years as testing school achievement has become more common and as students have become more 
diverse.

But alternate views of intelligence also exist that portray intelligence as having multiple forms, whether the forms are subparts of a single broader ability or are multiple “intelligences” in their own right. For various reasons such this perspective has gained in popularity among teachers in recent years, probably because it reflects many teachers’ beliefs that students cannot simply be rated along a single scale of ability, but are fundamentally diverse (Kohn, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2004). Test today, privatize tomorrow. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 85''(8), 568-577&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the most prominent of these models is Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1983, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1983). ''Frames of mind: The theory of multiple intelligences.'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (2003, April 21). ''Multiple intelligences after twenty years.'' Paper presented at the American Educational Research Association, Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;. Gardner proposes that there are eight different forms of intelligence, each of which functions independently of the others. (The eight intelligences are summarized in [[Table 4-1]].) Each person has a mix of all eight abilities—more of one but less of another—that helps to constitute that person’s individual cognitive profile. Since most tasks—including most tasks in classrooms—
require several forms of intelligence and can be completed in more than one way, it is possible for people with various profiles of talents to succeed on a task equally well. In writing an essay, for example, a student with high interpersonal intelligence but rather 
average verbal intelligence might use his or her interpersonal strength to get a lot of help and advice from classmates and the teacher. A student with the opposite profile might work well alone, but without the benefit of help from others. Both students might end up with essays that are good, but good for different reasons.

As evidence for the possibility of multiple intelligences, Gardner cites descriptions of individuals with exceptional talent in one form of intelligence (for example, in playing the piano) but who are neither above nor below average in other areas. He also cites descriptions of individuals with brain damage, some of whom lose one particular form of intelligence (like the ability to talk) but retain other forms. In the opinion of many psychologists, however, the evidence for multiple intelligences is not strong enough to give up the “classical” view of general intelligence. Part of the problem 
is that the evidence for multiple intelligences relies primarily on anecdotes—examples or descriptions of particular individuals who illustrate the model—rather than on more widespread information or data (Eisner, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, E. (2004). Multiple intelligences: Its tensions and possibilities. ''Teachers College Record, 106''(1), &lt;/ref&gt;.

Nonetheless, whatever the status of the research evidence, the model itself can be useful as a way for teachers to think about their work. Multiple intelligences suggest the importance of diversifying instruction in order to honor and to respond to diversity in students’ talents and abilities. Viewed like this, whether Gardner’s classification scheme is actually accurate is probably less important than the fact there is (or may be) more than one way to be “smart.” In the end, as with cognitive and learning styles, it may not be important to label students’ talents or intellectual strengths. It may be more important simply to provide important learning and knowledge in several modes or styles ways that draw on more than one possible form of intelligence or skill. A good example of this principle is your own development in learning to teach. It is well and good to read books about teaching (like this one, perhaps), but it is even better to read books and talk with 
classmates and educators about teaching and get actual experience in classrooms. The combination both invites and requires a wide range of your talents and usually proves more effective than any single type of activity, whatever your profile of cognitive styles or intellectual abilities happens to be.

==Gender differences in the classroom==
Gender roles are the patterns of behaviors, attitudes, and expectations associated with a particular sex—with being either male or female. For clarity, psychologists sometimes distinguish gender differences, which are related to social roles, from sex differences, which are related only to physiology and anatomy. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 4: Student Diversity/Gender Differences|(read more...)]]

==Differences in cultural expectations and learning styles==
A culture is the system of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that constitute the distinctive way of life of a people. Although sometimes the term is also used to refer specifically to the artistic, intellectual and other “high-brow” aspects of life, I use it here more broadly to refer to everything that characterizes a way of life—baseball games as well as symphony concerts, and McDonald’s as well as expensive restaurants.

==Accommodating diversity in practice==
Briefly, then, here is what this chapter said: Students differ in a multitude of ways, both individually and as groups. Individually, for example, students have ''preferred learning styles'' as well as preferred ''cognitive or thinking styles''. They also have unique ''cognitive profiles,'' intelligence or competence that affect how and what they learn most successfully.

In addition to individual diversity, students tend to differ according to ''behaviors associated with gender'', although there are many individual exceptions. ''Motor abilities'' as well as ''motivation'' and experience with athletics gradually differentiate boys and girls, especially when they reach high school and begin high school. ''Socially,'' boys tend to adopt relationships that are more active and wide-ranging than do girls. ''Academically,'' girls tend to be a bit more motivated and to receive slightly higher marks in school. ''Teachers sometimes contribute to gender role differences''—perhaps without intending—by paying attention to boys more frequently and more publicly in class, and by distributing praise and criticism in ways differentiated by sex.

Students also differ according to ''cultures, language, and ethnic groups'' of their families. Many students are ''bilingual,'' with educational consequences that depend on their fluency in each of their two languages. If they have more difficulty with English, then programs that add their first language together with English have proved to be helpful. If they have more difficulty with their first language, they are risk for language loss, and the consequences are also negative even if more hidden from teachers’ views.

In addition to language differences as such, students differ according to ''how they use language''—in taking turns at speaking, in eye contact, social distance, wait time, and the use of questions. Some of these differences stem from cultural differences about self-identity, with non-Anglo culturally sometimes (but not always) supporting a more interdependent view of the self than Anglo culture or the schools. Differences in attitudes and in use of language have several consequences for teachers. In particular—where appropriate—they should consider using cooperative activities, avoid highlighting individuals’ accomplishments or failures, and be patient about students’ learning to be punctual.

Hopefully, therefore, we ([[User talk: Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]], Rosemary Sutton and other contributors) have persuaded you—if you ever really needed persuading—that students are indeed diverse. The question that follows from this point is ''what to do'' about the diversity. We partially answered that question by making a number of teaching-related suggestions throughout this chapter. But there is obviously more to be said about accommodating diversity—about actually working with students’ differences and making them a resource rather than a burden or challenge. In the rest of this book therefore we offer more suggestions, not only about knowing how different one student can be from another, but also about diversifying teaching to acknowledge this fact. Differences among students are inevitably a challenge during all phases of teaching, from planning instruction, to implementing lessons and activities, to assessing students’ learning after lessons or activities are all finished. In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs|the next chapter]], we illustrate this reality by describing how students with disabilities can be included in classroom life—one of the more telling examples of accommodating to diversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===''Three People on the Margins''===
:'''''The First Person:''''' ''In 1761 a six-year-old girl was captured from West Africa, given the name Phillis Wheatley, and sold into slavery in the City of Boston. By the time she was 17, Phillis had taught herself to read and write and had developed a special love and talent for poetry. Her owner was a wealthy businessman and sought to improve his reputation by publishing an anthology of her poems. Unfortunately he encountered stiff resistance from publishers because few people at that time believed Africans to be capable of the thought and imagination needed to write poetry. People who heard of her poetry were skeptical and inclined to think that it was faked. Eventually, to save his own reputation, the owner assembled a tribunal of 18 prominent judges—including the governor of Massachusetts and John Hancock, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence—to assess the young woman’s mental capacity. After cross-examining her, the judges finally decided that Ms. Wheatley was, after all, capable of writing poetry (Robinson, 1982)&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, W. (1982). ''Critical essays on Phillis Wheatley.'' Boston: Hall Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;.''

:'''''The Second Person:''''' ''A century later, a child named Helen Keller lost her sight and hearing as a result of illness during infancy. In spite of this misfortune, though, Helen devised a language of gestural signs for communicating with a tutor, and was soon also using Braille to study both French and Latin. At ten she wrote and published a short story. Yet like Ms. Wheatley, Ms. Keller also faced substantial, chronic skepticism about her capacities. Prominent educators accused her of plagiarizing others’ writings and merely “parroting” others’ ideas without understanding them (Keller, 1954; Bogdan, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Keller, H. (1952). ''The story of my life.'' New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, D. (2006). Who may be literate? Disability and resistance to the cultural denial of competence. ''American Educational Research Journal, 43''(2), 163-192.&lt;/ref&gt;. Eventually, as with Wheatley, a panel was assembled—though this time the members were professional experts about disabilities—to determine whether Ms. Keller was in fact capable of writing what she published. The panel decided that was indeed capable, though only by a slim margin (five judges vs. four).''

:'''''The Third Person:''''' ''In 1978, Sue Rubin was born with a disability that limited her speech to disordered bursts of sound and occasionally echoing phrases of other people. She was labeled autistic because of her symptoms, and assumed to be profoundly retarded. With support and encouragement from her mother and others, however, Sue eventually learned to type on a keyboard without assistance. She learned to communicate effectively when she was about 13 and was able to go to school. Since then she has made many presentations about autism at conferences and recently co-edited a book about autism, titled Autism: The Myth of the Person Alone (Bogdan, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, D., Attfield, R., Bissonnette, L., Blackman, L., Burke, J., Mukopadhyay, T., &amp; Rubin, S.

One of these individuals experienced racial discrimination and the other two experienced physical disabilities, but notice something important: that all three were defined by society as disabled intellectually. Initially, their achievements were dismissed because of widespread assumptions—whether about race or disability—of their inherent incompetence. All three had to work harder than usual, not only to acquire literacy itself, but also to prove that their literacy was genuine and worthy of respect.

Since the time of Phillis Wheatley, North American society has eliminated slavery and made some progress at reducing certain forms of racism, though much remains to be done. In 1954, for example, the United States Supreme Court ruled that public schools could not be segregated by race, and in doing so recognized, at least legally, the intellectual competence of African-Americans as well as the moral obligation of society to provide all citizens with the best possible education. It has taken longer to recognize legally the rights and competence of persons with disabilities, but events and trends beginning in the 1970s have begun to make it happen. This chapter begins by explaining some of theses and how they have altered the work of teachers.

===Growing Support for People with Disabilities: Legislation and Its Effects===

Since the 1970s political and social attitudes have moved increasingly toward including people with disabilities into a wide variety of “regular” activities. In the United States, the shift is illustrated clearly in the Federal legislation that was enacted during this time. The legislation partly stimulated the change in attitudes, but at the same time they partly resulted from the change. Three major laws were passed that guaranteed the rights of persons with disabilities, and of children and students with disabilities in particular. Although the first two affected teachers’ work in the classroom, the third has had the biggest impact on education.

====Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504====
This law—the first of its kind—required that individuals with disabilities be accommodated in any program or activity that receives Federal funding (PL 93-112, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 93-112, 87 Stat. 394 (Sept. 26, 1973). ''Rehabilitation Act of 1973.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although this law was not intended specifically for education, in practice it has protected students’ rights in some extra-curricular activities (for older students) and in some child care or after-school care programs (for younger students). If those programs receive Federal funding of any kind, the programs are not allowed to exclude children or youth with disabilities, and they have to find reasonable ways to accommodate the individuals’ disabilities.

====Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or ''ADA'').====
This legislation also prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability, just as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act had done (PL 101-336, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (July 26, 1990). ''Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the ADA also applies to all people (not just to students), its provisions are more specific and “stronger” than those of Section 504. In particular, ADA extends to all employment and jobs, not just those receiving Federal funding. It also specifically requires accommodations to be made in public facilities such as buses, restrooms, and telephones. ADA legislation is therefore responsible for some of the “minor” renovations in schools that you may have noticed in recent years, like wheelchair-accessible doors, ramps, and restrooms, and public telephones with volume controls.

====Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (or ''IDEA'')====
As its name implied this legislation was more focused on education than either Section 504 or ADA. It was first passed in 1975 and has been amended several times since, including most recently in 2004 (PL 108-446, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 108-446, 118 Stat. 2647 (December 3, 2004). ''Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;. In its current form, the law guarantees the following rights related to education for anyone with a disability from birth to age 21. The first two influence schooling in general, but the last three affect the work of classroom teachers rather directly:
* ''Free, appropriate education:'' An individual or an individual’s family should not have to pay for education simply because the individual has a disability, and the educational program should be truly educational (i.e. not merely caretaking or “babysitting” of the person).

* ''Due process:'' In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the schools or other professionals, there must be procedures for resolving the disagreements that are fair and accessible to all parties—including the person himself or herself or the person’s representative.

* ''Fair evaluation of performance in spite of disability:'' Tests or other evaluations should not assume test-taking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be expected to have, such as holding a pencil, hearing or seeing questions, working quickly, or understanding and speaking orally. Evaluation procedures should be modified to allow for these differences. This provision of the law applies both to evaluations made by teachers and to school-wide or “high-stakes” testing programs.

* ''Education in the “least restrictive environment”:'' Education for someone with a disability should provide as many educational opportunities and options for the person as possible, both in the short term and in the long term. In practice this requirement has meant including students in regular classrooms and school activities as much as possible, though often not totally.

* ''An individualized educational program:'' Given that every disability is unique, instructional planning for a person with a disability should be unique or individualized as well. In practice this provision has led to classroom teachers planning individualized programs jointly with other professionals (like reading specialists, psychologists, or medical personnel) as part of a team.

Considered together, these provisions are both a cause and an effect of basic democratic philosophy. The legislation says, in effect, that all individuals should have access to society in general and to education in particular. Although teachers certainly support this philosophy in broad terms, and many have welcomed the IDEA legislation, others have found the prospect of applying it in classrooms leads to a number of questions and concerns. Some ask, for example, whether a student with a disability will disrupt the class; others, whether the student will interfere with covering the curriculum; still others, whether the student might be teased by classmates. Since these are legitimate concerns, I will return to them at the end of this chapter. First, however, let me clarify exactly how the IDEA legislation affects the work of teachers, and then describe in more detail the major disabilities that you are likely to encounter in students.

===Responsibilities of Teachers for Students with Disabilities===
The IDEA legislation has affected the work of teachers by creating three new expectations. The first expectation is to provide alternative methods of assessment for students with disabilities; the second is to arrange a learning environment that is as normal or as “least restrictive” as possible; and the third is to participate in creating individual educational plans for students with disabilities.

====Alternative Assessments====
In the context of students with disabilities, assessment refers to gathering information about a student in order both to identify the strengths of the student, and to decide what special educational support, if any, the student needs. In principle, of course, these are tasks that teachers have for all students: assessment is a major reason why we give tests and assignments, for example, and why we listen carefully to the quality of students’ comments during class discussions. For students with disabilities, however, such traditional or conventional strategies of assessment often seriously underestimate the students’ competence (Koretz &amp; Barton, 2003/2004; Pullin, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Koretz, D. &amp; Barton, K. (2003/2004). Assessing students with disabilities: Issues and evidence. ''Assessment and Evaluation, 9''(1 &amp; 2), 29-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, D. (2005). When one size does not fit all: The special challenges of accountability testing for students with disabilities. ''Yearbook of the National Society for Studies in Education, 104''(2), 199.&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on the disability, a student may have trouble with 
# holding a pencil,
# hearing a question clearly, 
# focusing on a picture, 
# marking an answer in time even when he or she knows the answer,
# concentrating on a task in the presence of other people, or
# answering a question at the pace needed by the rest of the class.
Traditionally, teachers have assumed that all students either have these skills or can learn them with just modest amounts of coaching, encouragement, and will power. For many other students, for example, it may be enough to say something like “Remember to listen to the question carefully!” For students with disabilities, however, a comment like this may not work and may even be insensitive. A student with visual impairment need not be reminded to “look at the page closely&quot; or &quot;at what I am writing on the board”; doing so will not cause the student to see the chalkboard more clearly—though the reminder might increase the student’s anxiety and self-consciousness.

There are a number of strategies for modifying assessments in ways that attempt to fair and that at the same time recognize how busy teachers usually are. One is to consider supplementing conventional assignments or tests with portfolios, which are collections of a student’s work that demonstrate a student’s development over time, and which usually include some sort of reflective or evaluative comments from the student, the teacher, or both (Carothers &amp; Taylor, 2003; Wesson &amp; King, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Carothers, D. &amp; Taylor, R. (2003). Use of portfolios for students with autism. ''Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disorders, 18''(2), 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesson,C. &amp; King, R. (1996). Portfolio assessment and special education students. ''Teaching Exceptional Children, 28''(2), 44-48.&lt;/ref&gt;. Another is to devise a system for observing the student regularly, even if briefly, and informally recording notes about the observations for later consideration and assessment. A third strategy is to recruit help from teacher assistants, who are sometimes present to help a student with a disability; an assistant can often conduct a brief test or activity with the student, and later report on and discuss the results with you.

If you reflect on these strategies, you may realize that they may sometimes create issues about fairness. If a student with a disability demonstrates competence one way but other students demonstrate it another, should they be given similar credit? On the other hand, is it fair for one student to get a lower mark because the student lacks an ability—such as normal hearing—that teachers cannot, in principle, ever teach? These ethical issues are legitimate and important, and I therefore return to them in Chapters 10 and 11, which discuss assessment in much more detail.

====Least Restrictive Environment====
The IDEA legislation calls for placing students with disabilities in the '''least restrictive environment''' (or '''LRE'''), defined as the combination of settings that involve the student with regular classrooms and school programs as much as possible. The precise combination is determined by the circumstances of a particular school and of the student. A kindergarten child with a mild cognitive disability, for example, may spend the majority of time in the regular kindergarten, working alongside and playing with non-disabled classmates and relying on a teacher assistant for help where needed. An individual with a similar disability in high school, however, might be assigned primarily to classes specially intended for slow learners, but nonetheless participate in some schoolwide activities alongside non-disabled students. The difference in LREs might reflect teachers’ perceptions of how difficult it is to modify the curriculum in each case; rightly or wrongly, teachers are apt to regard adaptation as more challenging at “higher” grade levels. By the same token, a student with a disability that is strictly physical might spend virtually all his or her time in regular classes throughout the student’s school career; in this case, adjustment of the curriculum would not be an issue.

For you, the policy favoring the least restrictive environment means that if you continue teaching long enough, you will very likely encounter a student with a disability in one or more of your classes, or at least have one in a school-related activity for which you are responsible. It also means that the special educational needs of these students will most often be the “mildest.” Statistically, the most frequent forms of special needs are learning disabilities, which are impairments in specific aspects of learning, and especially of reading. Learning disabilities account for about half of all special educational needs—as much as all other types put together. Somewhat less common are speech and language disorders, cognitive disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (abbreviated ''ADHD''). Because of their frequency and of the likelihood that you will meet students for whom these labels have been considered, I describe them more fully later in this chapter, along with other disability conditions that you will encounter much less frequently.

====Individual Educational Plan====
The third way that IDEA legislation and current educational approaches affect teachers is by requiring teachers and other professional staff to develop an annual '''individual educational plan''' (or '''IEP''') for each student with a disability. The plan is created by a team of individuals who know the student’s strengths and needs; at a minimum it includes one or more classroom teachers, a “resource” or special education teacher, and the student’s parents or guardians. Sometimes, too, the team includes a school administrator (like a vice-principal) or other professionals from outside the school (like a psychologist or physician), depending on the nature of the child’s disability. An IEP can take many forms, but it always describes a student’s current social and academic strengths as well as the student’s social or academic needs. It also specifies educational goals or objectives for the coming year, lists special services to be provided, and describes how progress toward the goals will be assessed at the end of year. [[Figure 5-1]] shows a simple IEP for a student named Sean, a boy having difficulties with reading. IEPs like the one in the figure originally served mainly students in the younger grades, but more recently they have been extended and modified to serve transition planning for adolescents with disabilities who are approaching the end of their public schooling (West, et al., 1999)&lt;ref&gt;West,  L., Corbey, S., Boyer-Stephens, A., Jones, B. Miller, R., &amp; Sarkees-Wircenski, M. (1999). ''Integrating transition planning into the IEP process, 2nd edition.'' Alexandria, VA: Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt;. For these students, the goals of the plan often include activities (like finding employment) to extend beyond schooling as such.
        
If you have a student with an IEP, you can expect two consequences for teaching. The first is that you should expect to make definite, clear plans for the student, and to put the plans in writing. This consequence does not, of course, prevent you from taking advantage of unexpected or spontaneous classroom events as well in order to enrich the curriculum. But it does mean that an educational program for a student with a disability cannot consist only of the unexpected or spontaneous. The second consequence is that you should not expect to construct an educational plan alone, as is commonly done when planning regular classroom programs. When it comes to students with disabilities, expect instead to plan as part of a team. Working with others ensures that everyone who is concerned about the student has a voice. It also makes it possible to improve the quality of IEPs by pooling ideas from many sources—even if, as you might suspect, it also can challenge professionals to communicate clearly and cooperate respectfully with team members in order to serve a student as well as possible.

==Categories of Disabilities—and Their Ambiguities==
So far I have said a lot about why inclusion has come to be important for teachers, but not much about the actual nature of students’ disabilities. Part of the reason for delaying was because, to put it simply, disabilities are inherently ambiguous. Naming and describing “types” of them implies that disabilities are relatively fixed, stable, and distinct, like different kinds of fruit or vegetables. As many teachers discover, though, the reality is somewhat different. The behavior and qualities of a particular student with a disability can be hard to categorize. The student may be challenged not only by the disability, but also by experiences common to all students, disabled or not Any particular disability, furthermore, poses problems more in some situations than in others. A student with a reading difficulty may have trouble in a language arts class, for example, but not in a physical education class; a student with a hearing impairment may have more trouble “hearing” a topic that he dislikes compared to one that he likes. Because official descriptions of types or categories of disability overlook these complexities, they risk stereotyping the real, live people to whom they are applied (Green, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Green, S., Davis, C., Karshmer, E., March, P. &amp; Straight, B. (2005). Living stigma: The impact of labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination in the lives of individuals with disabilities and their families. ''Sociological Inquiry, 75''(2), 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt;. Even the simplifications might not be a serious problem if the resulting stereotypes were complimentary—most of us would not mind being called a “genius,” for example, even if the description is not always true. Stereotypes about disabilities, however, are usually stigmatizing, not complimentary.

Still, categories of disabilities do serve useful purposes by giving teachers, parents, and other professionals a language or frame of reference for talking about disabilities. They also can help educators when arranging special support services for students, since a student has to “have” an identifiable, nameable need if professionals are to provide help. Educational authorities have therefore continued to use categories (or “labels”) to classify disabilities in spite of expressing continuing concern about whether the practice hurts students’ self-esteem or standing in the eyes of peers (Biklen &amp; Kliewer, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, S. &amp; Kliewer, C. (2006). Constructing competence: Autism, voice and the “disordered” body. ''International Journal of Inclusive Education, 10''(2/3), 169-188.&lt;/ref&gt;. For classroom teachers, the best strategy may be simply to understand how categories of disabilities are defined, while also keeping their limitations in mind and being ready to explain their limitations (tactfully, of course) to parents or others who use the labels inappropriately.

That said, what in fact are the major types of disabilities encountered by teachers? The next sections of this chapter look at them one at a time, beginning the more common ones.

===Learning disabilities===
A '''learning disability''' (or '''LD''') is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes with a specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student’s academic performance significantly. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs/Learning disabilities|(read more...)]]

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (or ADHD) is a problem with sustaining attention and controlling impulses. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs/ADHD|(read more...)]]

===Intellectual disabilities===
An intellectual disability is a significant limitation in a student’s cognitive functioning and daily adaptive behaviors...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs/Intellectual Disabilities|(read more...)]]

===Behavioral disorders===
Behavioral disorders are a diverse group of conditions in which a student chronically performs highly inappropriate behaviors. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs/Behavioral Disorders|(read more...)]]

===Physical disabilities and sensory impairments===
A few students have serious physical, medical or sensory challenges that interfere with their learning. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs/Physical and Sensory Impairments|(read more...)]]

==The value of including students with special needs==
I have hinted at it already in this chapter, but it is worth saying again: including students with disabilities in regular classrooms is valuable for everyone concerned. The students with disabilities themselves tend to experience a richer educational environment, both socially and academically. Just as with racial segregation, separate education is not equal education, or at least cannot be counted on to be equal. But classmates of students with disabilities also experience a richer educational environment; they potentially meet a wider range of classmates and to see a wider range of educational purposes in operation. Teachers also experience these benefits, but their programs often benefit in other ways as well. The most notable additional benefit is that many teaching strategies that are good for students with disabilities also turn out to benefit all students—benefits like careful planning of objectives, attention to individual differences among students, and establishment of a positive social atmosphere in the classroom. Later (in Chapter 8 and 9) we will return to these topics because of their importance for high-quality teaching. But at that point we will frame the topics around the needs of all students, whatever their individual qualities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motives as Behavior==        
Sometimes it is useful to think of motivation not as something &quot;inside&quot; a student driving the student’s behavior, but as equivalent to the student’s outward behaviors. This is the perspective of behaviorism, which I discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process]] as a way to think about the learning process. In its most thorough-going form, behaviorism focuses almost completely on what can be directly seen or heard about a person’s behavior, and has relatively few comments about what may lie behind (or “underneath” or “inside”) the behavior. When it comes to motivation, this perspective means minimizing or even ignoring the distinction between the inner drive or energy of students, and the outward behaviors that express the drive or energy. The two are considered the same, or nearly so.

Equating the inner and the outward might seem to violate common sense. How can a student do something without some sort of feeling or thought to make the action happen? As we will explain, this very question has led to alternative models of motivation that are based on cognitive rather than behaviorist theories of learning. We will explain some of these later in this chapter. Before getting to them, however, we encourage you to consider the advantages of a behaviorist perspective on motivation.

Sometimes the circumstances of teaching limit teachers’ opportunities to distinguish between inner motivation and outward behavior. Certainly teachers see plenty of student behaviors—signs of motivation of some sort. But the multiple demands of teaching can limit the time needed to determine what the behaviors mean. If a student asks a lot of questions during discussions, for example, is he or she is curious about the material itself, or just wanting to look intelligent in front of classmates and the teacher? In a class with many students and a busy agenda, there may not be a lot of time for a teacher to decide between these possibilities. In other cases, the problem may not be limited time as much as communication difficulties with a student. Consider a student who is still learning English, or who belongs to a cultural community that uses patterns of conversation that are unfamiliar to the teacher, or who has a disability that limits the student’s general language skill. In these cases discerning the student’s inner motivations may take more time and effort. It is important to invest the extra time and effort for such students, but while a teacher is doing so, it is also important for her to guide and influence the students’ behavior in constructive directions. That is where behaviorist approaches to motivation can help.

===Operant Conditioning as a Way of Motivating===
The most common version of the behavioral perspective on motivation is the theory of operant conditioning associated with B. F. Skinner (1938, 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1938). ''The behavior of organisms.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1957). ''Verbal behavior.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;, which we discussed in [[../Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]]. The description in that chapter focused on behavioral learning, but the same operant model can be transformed into an account of motivation. In the operant model, you may recall, a behavior being learned (the “operant”) increases in frequency or likelihood because performing it makes a reinforcement available. To understand this model in terms of motivation, think of the likelihood of response as the motivation and the reinforcement as the motivator. Imagine, for example, that a student learns by operant conditioning to answer questions during class discussions: each time the student answers a question (the operant), the teacher praises (reinforces) this behavior. In addition to thinking of this situation as behavioral learning, however, you can also think of it in terms of motivation: the likelihood of the student answering questions (the motivation) is increasing because of the teacher’s praise (the motivator).

Many concepts from operant conditioning, in fact, can be understood in motivational terms. Another one, for example, is the concept of extinction, which we defined in Chapter 2 as the tendency for learned behaviors to become less likely when reinforcement no longer occurs—a sort of “unlearning,” or at least a decrease in performance of previously learned. The decrease in performance frequency can be thought of as a loss of motivation, and removal of the reinforcement can be thought of as removal of the motivator. [[Table 6-1]] summarizes this way of reframing operant conditioning in terms of motivation, both for the concepts discussed in Chapter 2 and for other additional concepts.

===Cautions about Behavioral Perspectives on Motivation===
As we mentioned, behaviorist perspectives about motivation do reflect a classroom reality: that teachers sometimes lack time and therefore must focus simply on students’ appropriate outward behavior. But there are nonetheless cautions about adopting this view. An obvious one is the ambiguity of students’ specific behaviors; what looks like a sign of one motive to the teacher may in fact be a sign of some other motive to the student (DeGrandpre, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;DeGranpre, R. (2000). A science of meaning: Can behaviorism bring meaning to psychological science? ''American Psychologist, 55''(7), 721-736.&lt;/ref&gt;. If a student looks at the teacher intently while she is speaking, does it mean the student is motivated to learn, or only that the student is daydreaming? If a student invariably looks away while the teacher is speaking, does it mean that the student is disrespectful of the teacher, or that student comes from a family or cultural group where avoiding eye contact actually shows more respect for a speaker than direct eye contact?

Another concern about behaviorist perspectives, including operant conditioning, is that it leads teachers to ignore students’ choices and preferences, and to “play God” by making choices on their behalf (Kohn, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (1996). ''No contest: The case against competition.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to this criticism, the distinction between “inner” motives and expressions of motives in outward behavior does not disappear just because a teacher (or a psychological theory) chooses to treat a motive and the behavioral expression of a motive as equivalent. Students usually do know what they want or desire, and their wants or desires may not always correspond to what a teacher chooses to reinforce or ignore. This, in a new guise, is once again the issue of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation that we discussed in Chapter 2. Approaches that are exclusively behavioral, it is argued, are not sensitive enough to students’ intrinsic, self-sustaining motivations.

As we pointed out in Chapter 2, there is truth to this allegation if a teacher actually does rely on rewarding behaviors that she alone has chosen, or even if she persists in reinforcing behaviors that students already find motivating without external reinforcement. In those cases reinforcements can backfire: instead of serving as an incentive to desired behavior, reinforcement can become a reminder of the teacher’s power and of students’ lack of control over their own actions. A classic research study of intrinsic motivation illustrated the problem nicely. In the study, researchers rewarded university students for two activities—solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines—that they already found interesting. Some of the students, however, were paid to do these activities, whereas others were not. Under these conditions, the students who were paid were less likely to engage in the activities following the experiment than were the students who were not paid, even though both groups had been equally interested in the activities to begin with (Deci, 1971)&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E. (1971). Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 18,'' 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt;. The extrinsic reward of payment, it seemed, interfered with the intrinsic reward of working the puzzles.

Later studies confirmed this effect in numerous situations, though they have also found certain conditions where extrinsic rewards do not reduce intrinsic rewards. Extrinsic rewards are not as harmful, for example, if a person is paid “by the hour” (i.e. by a flat rate) rather than piecemeal (by the number of items completed) (Cameron &amp; Pierce, 1994; Eisenberger &amp; Cameron, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, J. &amp; Pierce, W. (1994). Reinforcement, reward, and intrinsic motivation: A meta-analysis. ''Review of Educational Research, 64,'' 363-423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R. &amp; Cameron, J. (1996). Detrimental effects of reward: Reality or myth? ''American Psychologist, 51,'' 1153-1166.&lt;/ref&gt;. They also are less harmful if the task itself is relatively well-defined (like working math problems or playing solitaire) and high-quality performance is expected at all times. So there are still times and ways when externally determined reinforcements are useful and effective. In general, however, extrinsic rewards do seem to undermine intrinsic motivation often enough that they need to be used selectively and thoughtfully (Deci, Koestner, &amp; Ryan, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E., Koestner, R., &amp; Ryan, R. (2001). Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again. ''Review of Educational Research, 71''(1), 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;. As it happens, help with being selective and thoughtful can be found in the other, more cognitively oriented theories of motivation. These use the goals, interests, and beliefs of students as ways of explaining differences in students’ motives and in how the motives affect engagement with school. We turn to these cognitively oriented theories next, beginning with those focused on students’ goals.

==Motives as goals==
One way motives vary is by the kind of goals that students set for themselves, and by how the goals support students’ academic achievement. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation/Motives as Goals|(read more...)]]

==Motives as interests==
In addition to holding different kinds of goals—with consequent differences in academic motivation—students show obvious differences in level of interest in the topics and tasks of the classroom. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation/Motives as Interests|(read more...)]]

==Motives related to attributions==
'''Attributions''' are perceptions about the causes of success and failure. Suppose that you get a low mark on a test and are wondering what caused the low mark. You can construct various explanations for—make various attributions about [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation/Motives Related to Attributions|(read more...)]]

==Motives as self-efficacy==
In addition to being influenced by their goals, interests, and attributions, students’ motives are affected by specific beliefs about the student’s personal capacities. In self-efficacy theory the beliefs become a primary, explicit explanation for motivation [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation/Motives as Self-Efficacy|(read more...)]]

==Motivation as self-determination==
A recent theory of motivation based on the idea of needs is self-determination theory, proposed by the psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (2000), among others. The theory proposes that understanding motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation/Motivation as Self-Determination|(read more...)]]

==Expectancy x value: effects on students’ motives==
As we have explained in this chapter, motivation is affected by several factors, including reinforcement for behavior, but especially also students’ goals, interests, and sense of self-efficacy and self-determination. The factors combine to create two general sources of motivation: students’ expectation of success and the value that students place on a goal. Viewing motivation in this way is often called the expectancy-value model...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation/Expectancy-Value Theory|(read more...)]]

==The bottom line about motivation: sustaining focus on learning==
Sooner or later when you teach, there will be situations appropriate for each perspective about motivation described in this chapter. There will be times when focusing exclusively on students’ appropriate behavior (or lack thereof) will be both necessary and sufficient evidence of motivation. But there will be other times when it is important to encourage students’ beliefs that they can accomplish specific tasks, and still other times when providing for students’ underlying needs for competence or social connection is important. Think of these perspectives as alternatives, to be used either singly or in combination when the time is right.

Because of your own values, attitudes, or beliefs, you may find one perspective more personally compatible than another. Even if you settle on favorite ways of motivating students, though, we encourage you to keep the other, less favored approaches in reserve anyway, and to experiment with them. We believe that an eclectic approach to motivation will enrich your teaching the most, and enrich your students’ motivation and learning as well. If there is a single lesson from the concepts about motivation outlined in this chapter, it is this: academic motivation has no single source, and teachers motivate students the best when they assume motivation is complex. The next two chapters look at ways of realizing such “broad-mindedness” in practice, first when you prepare activities and classes and later when you actually teach them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:An excerpt from a professional journal kept by me [[User talk:Klseifert|(KelvinLeeSeifert)]] when I was teaching kindergarten:

::''November 14th: Today my student Carol sat in the circle, watching others while we all played Duck, Duck, Goose (in this game, one student is outside the circle, tags another student who then chases the first person around the circle). Carol’s turn had already passed. Apparently she was bored now, because she flopped on her back, smiling broadly, rolling around luxuriously on the floor in the path of the other runners. Several classmates noticed her, smiled or giggled, began flopping down as well. One chaser tripped over a “flopper.”''

::''Sit up, Carol,” said I, the ever-vigilant teacher. “You’re in the way.” But no result. I repeated twice more, firmly; then moved to pick her up.''

::''Instantly Carol ran to the far side of the gym, still smiling broadly. Then her best friend ran off with her. Now a whole new game was launched, or really two games: “Run-from-the-teacher” and “Enjoy-being-watched-by-everybody.” A lot more exciting, unfortunately, than Duck, Duck, Goose!''

:An excerpt from Kelvin’s same journal several years later, when he was teaching math in high school:

::''March 4th: The same four students sat in the back again today, as usual. They seem to look in every direction except at me, even when I’m explaining material that they need to know. The way they smile and whisper to each other, it seems almost like they are &quot;in love&quot; with each other, though I can’t be sure who loves whom the most. Others—students not part of the foursome—seem to react variously. Some seem annoyed, turn the other way, avoid talking with the group, and so on. But others seem almost envious—as if they want to be part of the &quot;in&quot; group, too, and were impressed with the foursome’s ability to get away with being inattentive and almost rude. Either way, I think a lot of other students are being distracted.''

::''Twice during the period today, I happened to notice members of the group passing a note, and then giggling and looking at me. By the end, I had had enough of this sort of thing, so I kept them in briefly after class and asked one of them to read the note. They looked a bit embarrassed and hesitant, but eventually one of them opened the note and read it out loud. “Choose one,” it said. “Mr. Seifert looks 1) old ____, 2) stupid____, or 3)clueless____.”''

Kelvin's experiences in managing these very different classrooms taught him what every teacher knows or else quickly learns: management matters a lot. But his experiences also taught that management is about more than correcting the misbehaviors of individuals, more than just &quot;discipline.&quot; Classroom management is also about &quot;orchestrating&quot; or coordinating entire sets or sequences of learning activities so that everyone, misbehaving or not, learns as easily and productively as possible. Educators sometimes therefore describe good classroom management as the creation of a positive learning environment, because a term calls attention to the totality of activities and people in a classroom, as well as to their goals and expectations about learning (Jones &amp; Jones, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Jones, V. &amp; Jones, L. (2006). ''Comprehensive classroom management: Creating communities of support and solving problems, 6th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. When Kelvin was teaching, he used both terms almost interchangeably, though in speaking of management he more often was referring to individual students’ behavior and learning, and in using the term learning environment he more often meant the overall “feel” of the class as a whole.

==Why classroom management matters==
Managing the learning environment is both a major responsibility and an on-going concern for every teacher, even those with years of experience (Good &amp; Brophy, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Good, T. &amp; Brophy, J. (2002). ''Looking in classrooms, 9th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several reasons. In the first place, a lot goes on in classrooms simultaneously, even when students seem to be doing only “one” task together. Twenty-five students may all be working on a sheet of math problems. But look more closely: several may be stuck on a particular problem, but each for different reasons. A few others have worked only the first problem or two and are now chatting quietly with each other instead of continuing. Still others have finished and are wondering what to do next. At any one moment each student needs something different—different information, different hints, different kinds of encouragement. The diversity increases even more if the teacher deliberately assigns multiple activities to different groups or individuals (for example, if some are doing a reading assignment while others do the math problems).

Another reason that managing the environment is challenging is because a teacher can never predict everything that will happen in a class. A well-planned lesson may fall flat on its face, or take less time than you expect, and you find yourself improvising to fill class time. On the other hand an unplanned moment may become a wonderful, sustained exchange among students; so you have to drop previous plans and “go with the flow” of their discussion. Interruptions happen continually: a fire drill, a quick drop-in visit from another teacher or from the principal, a call on the intercom from the office. An activity may turn out well, but also end up rather differently than you intended; you therefore have to decide how, if at all, to adjust the next day to allow for this surprise.

A third reason for the importance of management is that students form opinions and perceptions about your teaching that may coincide neither with your own nor with other students’. What seems to you like encouragement of a shy student may seem to the student herself like “forced participation.” A more eager, outgoing classmate watching your special effort to encourage the shy student, however, may not see you as either encouraging or coercing, but as overlooking or ignoring other students who are already more willing to participate. The variety of perceptions can lead to surprises in students’ responses to you—most often small ones, but occasionally more major.

At the broadest, society-wide level, management challenges teachers because public schooling is not voluntary, and students’ presence in a classroom is therefore not a sign, in and of itself, that they wish to learn. Students’ presence is instead just a sign that an opportunity exists for teachers to motivate students to learn. Many students, of course, do enjoy learning and being in school—but not all. Others do enjoy school, but primarily because teachers have worked hard to make classroom life pleasant and interesting. They become motivated because you have successfully created a positive learning environment and have sustained it through skillful management.

Fortunately it is possible to earn this sort of commitment from students, and this chapter describes some ways of doing so. We begin with some ways of preventing management problems in the first place by increasing students’ focus on learning. The methods include the arrangement of classroom space, the establishment of procedures, routines, and rules, and communicating the importance of learning both to students and to parents. After these prevention oriented discussions, we look at ways of refocusing students when and if their minds or actions do stray from the tasks at hand. As you probably know from your own experience as a student, bringing students back on task can happen in many ways, ways that vary widely in the energy and persistence required of the teacher. We try to indicate some of this diversity, but because of space limitations and because of the richness of classroom life, we cannot describe them all.

==Preventing management problems by focusing students on learning==
The easiest management problems to solve are ones that do not happen in the first place! You can help to prevent problems even before the first day of school by...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment/Preventing Management Programs| (read more...)]]

===Pacing and structuring lessons and activities===
One of the best ways to prevent management problems is by pacing and structuring lessons or activities as smoothly and continuously as possible. Reaching this goal depends on...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment/Pacing and Structuring| (read more...)]]

==Responding to student misbehavior==
So far we have focused on preventing behaviors that are off-task, or inappropriate&lt;s&gt;, or annoying&lt;/s&gt;. Our advice has all been pro-active or forward-looking: plan the classroom space thoughtfully, create reasonable procedures and rules, pace lessons and activities appropriately, and communicate the importance of learning clearly. Although we consider these ideas to be important, it would be naïve to imply they are enough to prevent all behavior problems...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment/Responding to Misbehavior|(read more...)]]

==Keeping management issues in perspective==
There are two messages from this chapter. One is that management issues are important, complex, and deserve any teacher’s serious attention. The other is that management strategies exist and can reduce, if not eliminate, management problems when and if they occur. We have explained what some of those strategies are—including some intended to prevent problems from happening and others intended to remedy problems if they do occur.

But there is a third message that this chapter cannot convey by itself: that good classroom management is not an end in itself, but a means for creating a climate where learning happens as fully as possible. During the stress of handling problem behaviors, there is sometimes a risk of losing sight of this idea. Quiet listening is never a goal in itself, for example; it is desirable only because (or when) it allows students to hear the teacher’s instructions or classmates’ spoken comments, or because it allows students to concentrate on their work or assignments better. There may therefore actually be moments when quiet listening is not important to achieve, such as during a “free choice” time in an elementary classroom or during a period of group work in a middle school classroom. As teachers, we need to keep this perspective firmly in mind. Classroom management should serve students’ learning, and not the other way around. The next chapter helps to remind us of that priority, because it discusses ways not just to set the stage for learning, as this chapter has done, but to help students more directly to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The main idea behind allocation is effective utilization of file space and fast access of the files. There are three types of allocation: 
operating system designs
# contiguous allocation
# linked allocation
# indexed allocation
data storage
1.achitecture
2.cpu scheduling
3.memory re allocation.
In addition to storing the actual file data on the disk, the file system also stores metadata about the files: the name of each file, when it was last edited, exactly where it is on the disk, and what parts of the disk are &quot;free&quot;. Free areas are not currently in use by the file data or the metadata, and so available for storing new files. (The places where this metadata is stored are often called &quot;inodes&quot;, &quot;chunks&quot;, &quot;[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/FAT|file allocation tables]]&quot;, etc.)

To keep track of the free space, the file system maintains a free-space list which tracks all the disk blocks which are free. To create a file, the required space is reserved for the file and the corresponding space is removed from the free list.

== Contiguous allocation ==

With contiguous allocation, each file has to occupy contiguous blocks on the disk. The location of a file is defined by the disk address of the first block and its length. Both sequential access and direct access are supported by the contiguous allocation. The disadvantage of contiguous allocation is that it is often difficult to find free space for a new file. Moreover, one is often not sure of the space required while creating a new file. The various methods adopted to find space for a new file suffer from external fragmentation.

== Linked allocation ==

In linked allocation, each file is a linked list of disk blocks. The directory contains a pointer to the first and (optionally the last) block of the file. For example, a file of 5 blocks which starts at block 4, might continue at block 7, then block 16, block 10, and finally block 27. Each block contains a pointer to the next block and the last block contains a NIL pointer. The value -1 may be used for NIL to differentiate it from block 0.

With linked allocation, each directory entry has a pointer to the first disk block of the file. This pointer is initialized to nil (the end-of-list pointer value) to signify an empty file. A write to a file removes the first free block and writes to that block. This new block is then linked to the end of the file. To read a file, the pointers are just followed from block to block.

There is no external fragmentation with linked allocation. Any free block can be used to satisfy a request. Notice also that there is no need to declare the size of a file when that file is created. A file can continue to grow as long as there are free blocks. Linked allocation, does have disadvantages, however. The major problem is that it is inefficient to support direct-access; it is effective only for sequential-access files. To find the ith block of a file, it must start at the beginning of that file and follow the pointers until the ith block is reached. Note that each access to a pointer requires a disk read.

== Indexed allocation ==
Linked allocation does not support random access of files, since each block can only be found from the previous. Indexed allocation solves this problem by bringing all the pointers together into an index block.
This type of allocation will have a pointer which has the address of all the blocks of a file. This method solves the problem of fragmentation as the blocks can be stored in any location.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''A few years ago one of us [[User talk: Klseifert|(KelvinLeeSeifert)]] had the privilege of co-teaching with an experienced first-grade teacher, Carolyn Eaton. As part of a research project, Ms. Eaton allowed some of her reading lessons to be observed. Here is what Kelvin saw when she was having a conference with Joey. They are reading a book “together,” except that Ms. Eaton wants Joey to do as much as possible of the reading himself. Joey’s comments capitalized, and Ms. Eaton’s are in lowercase.''

::''FIRST YOU READ—THEN ME. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I READ AFTER YOU, OK?''
::''OK. [Ms. Eaton begins.] “In the great green room there was a telephone, a red balloon, and a picture of…” Are you going to read, or what?''
::''YES.''
::''“In the great green room there was…” Are you ready yet? Ready to read?''
::''OK. “IN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM…”''
::''“…there was…”''
::''“THERE WAS A…” [pauses, looking at Ms. Eaton rather than at the words]''
::''“…a telephone…”''
::''YES, THAT’S IT, A TELEPHONE! “IN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM THERE WAS A TELEPHONE, A RED BALLOON…”''
::''“and a picture of…”''
::''“AND A PICTURE OF ‘pauses, staring at the wall]…A COW JUMPING?”''
::''“a cow jumping over the moon.”''
::''“OVER MOON.” [smiles from both Joey and Ms. Eaton]''
::''Joey, what does this say? [She points to the word telephone.]'' 
::''“THERE WAS A TELEPHONE.”''
::''How about here? [She points to next page, which reads “And there were three little bears, sitting on chairs.”]''
::''“THERE WERE BEARS, THREE BEARS, AND THEY SAT ON CHAIRS.”''
::''Can you read the whole book?''
::''SURE!''
::''OK, then you start this time.''
::[Joey looks at first page, alternately at the picture and at the words.]'' 
::''“IN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM THERE WAS A TELEPHONE.”''
::''[Actual text: “In the great green room, there was a telephone,”]''
::''“AND THERE WAS A RED BALLOON,”''
::''[Actual text: “…and a read balloon,”]''
::''“AND A PICTURE OF THE COW JUMPING OVER THE MOON.”''
::''[Actual text: “…and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon.”]''
::''“AND THERE WERE…” THREE BEARS?…”LITTLE BEARS SITTING ON CHAIRS.”''
::''[Actual text: “And there were three little bears, sitting on chairs,…”]''
::''Could you read this book with you eyes closed?''
::''SURE; WANT TO SEE ME DO IT?!''
::''Well, not right now; maybe another time. Could you read it without the pictures, just looking at the words? That’s how I do best—when I see the words instead of the pictures.''
::''[Joey pauses to consider this.] MAYBE, BUT NOT QUITE SO WELL.''
::''Let’s try it. [Ms. Eaton proceeds to copy the words on a large sheet for Joey to “read” later.]''

As Carolyn Eaton’s experience suggests, there are decisions to make even during the very act of teaching. Ms. Eaton wonders when to challenge Joey, and when to support him—and so will you. She also wonders when to guide Joey to take stock of what he just read, and when to move him on ahead—and you too will wonder when to consolidate a student’s learning, and when to nudge the student forward These are questions about instructional strategies, which are teachers’ decisions or actions meant to facilitate learning, either directly or indirectly. In this chapter we review as many of these as space allows, in order to give a sense of the major instructional options and of their effects. We concentrate especially on two broad categories of instruction, sometimes called direct instruction and student-centered instruction. As we hope that you will agree, each of these approaches to teaching is useful for certain purposes. We begin, though, by looking at what often guides choices among instructional strategies: the ways that teachers would like students to think when engaged in classroom learning. What does it mean for students to think critically (astutely or logically)? Or to think creatively? Or to be skillful problem solvers? Answers to these questions imply choices among instructional strategies, though they do not determine the choices fully.

==Forms of Thinking Associated with Classroom Learning==
Although instructional strategies differ in their details, they all function to encourage certain major forms of learning and thinking, each with distinctive educational purposes. The forms sometimes overlap, in the sense that one form of thinking may contribute to a student’s success with another form. To see what we mean, look first at three somewhat complex forms of thinking that are common goals of classroom learning:
* critical thinking,
* creative thinking, and
* problem-solving.

===Critical Thinking===
Critical thinking is the mental skill for analyzing the reliability and validity of information, as well as an attitude or disposition to do so. The skill and attitude may be expressed or displayed with regard to a particular subject matter or topic, but in principle it can occur in any realm of knowledge or living (Halpern, 2003; Williams, Oliver, &amp; Stockade, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2003). ''Thought and knowledge: An introduction to critical thinking.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R., Oliver, R., &amp; Stockade, S. (2004). Psychological versus generic critical thinking as predictors and outcome measures in a large undergraduate human development course. ''Journal of General Education, 53''(1), 37-58.&lt;/ref&gt;. A critical thinker does not necessarily have a negative attitude in the everyday sense of being critical of someone or something. Instead he or she can simply be thought of as astute: the critical thinker asks key questions, evaluates the evidence for ideas accurately, reasons about problems logically and objectively, and expresses ideas and conclusions clearly and precisely. Last (but not least), the critical thinker can apply these habits of mind in more than one realm of life or knowledge, though he or she may not always do so in fact.

With such a broad definition, it is not surprising that educators have nominated a wide variety of specific cognitive skills as contributors to critical thinking. In one study, for example, the researcher found that critical thinking about a published article was stimulated by annotation—writing questions and comments in the margins of the article (Liu, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Liu, K. (2006). Annotation as an index to critical writing. ''Urban Education, 41''(2), 192-207.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this study students who were initially instructed in ways of annotating reading materials. Later, when the students completed additional readings for assignments, it was found that some students in fact used their annotation skills much more than others—some simply underlined passages, for example, with a highlighting pen. When essays written about the readings were later analyzed, the ones written by the annotators were found to be more well-reasoned—more critically astute—than the essays written by the other students.

But the skills comprising critical thinking are not just written ones. In another study, for example, a researcher found that critical thinking can also involve oral discussion with classmates of personal issues or dilemmas (Hawkins, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, J. (2006). Accessing multicultural issues through critical thinking, critical inquiry, and the student research process. ''Urban Education, 41''(2), 169-191.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this study, students were asked to describe to classmates a recent personal incident that disturbed them. Classmates then discussed the incident together in order to identify the precise reasons why the incident was disturbing to the individual, as well as the assumptions that the student had made in thinking about the incident. The original student—the one who had first told the story—then used the results of the group discussion to frame a topic for a research essay. In one story of a troubling incident, for example, a student told of a time when a store clerk has snubbed or rejected the student during a recent shopping errand. Through discussion, classmates decided that an assumption underlying the student’s disturbance was her suspicion that she had been a victim of racial profiling based on her skin color. The student then used this idea as the basis for a research essay on the topic of “racial profiling in retail stores.” The group discussion thus stimulated critical thinking in the student and the classmates, but it also relied on their prior critical thinking skills at the same time.

Notice that in both of these research studies, as in others like them, what made the thinking “critical” was students’ use of metacognition—strategies for thinking about thinking and for monitoring the success and quality of one’s own thinking. This is a concept that we discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]] as a feature of constructivist views about learning. There we pointed out that when students acquire experience in building their own knowledge, they also become skilled both at knowing how they learn, and at knowing whether they have learned something well. These two defining qualities of metacognition are part of critical thinking as well. In fostering critical thinking, then, a teacher is really fostering a student’s ability to construct or control his or her own thinking and to avoid being controlled by ideas unreflectively.

How best to teach the skills of critical thinking, however, remains a matter of debate. One issue is whether to infuse critical skills into existing courses or to teach them through separate, free-standing units or courses. The first approach has the potential advantage of demonstrating how critical thinking relates to students’ entire educations. But it does so at the risk of diluting students’ understanding and use of critical thinking simply because critical thinking takes on so in many different forms—its details and appearance varying among courses and teachers. The free-standing approach has the opposite qualities: it stands a better chance of being understood clearly and coherently, but by the same token its connections to other courses, tasks, and activities may not be as clear to students. This is the issue—again—of '''transfer,''' discussed earlier in Chapter 2. Unfortunately, research to compare the infusion versus free-standing strategies for teaching critical teaching does not settle the matter; it suggests that either approach can work as long as it is implemented thoroughly and the teachers are committed to the value of critical thinking (Halpern, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2003). ''Thought and knowledge: An introduction to critical thinking.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A related issue about teaching critical thinking is about who needs or should learn critical thinking skills the most. Should it in fact be all students? This goal seems the most democratic and therefore appropriate for educators. Surveys of teachers have found, however, that teachers sometimes favor teaching of critical thinking to high-advantage students—the ones who already achieve well, who come from relatively high-income families, or (for high school students) who take courses intended for university entrance (Warburton &amp; Torff, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Warburton, E. &amp; Torff, E. (2005). The effect of perceived learner advantages on teachers’ beliefs about critical-thinking activities. ''Journal of Teacher Education, 56''(1), 24-33.&lt;/ref&gt;. Presumably the rationale for this bias is that high-advantage students can benefit and/or understand and use critical thinking better than other students.  There is little evidence to support this idea, however, even if it were not ethically questionable. The study by Hawkins (2006) described above, for example, achieved good success teaching critical thinking even with students usually considered low-advantage.

===Creative thinking===
'''Creativity''' is the ability to make something new that is also useful or valued by others (Gardner, 1993). The “something” can be an object (like an essay or painting), a skill (like playing an instrument), or an action (like using a familiar tool in a new way)....[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Creative Thinking|(read more...)]] 

===Problem-solving===
Somewhere between open-ended, creative thinking and the focused learning of content lies problem solving, the analysis and solution of tasks and situations that are somewhat complex or ambiguous and that pose difficulties, inconsistencies, or obstacles of some kind...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Problem-Solving|(read more...)]]

==Major instructional strategies and their relationships==
Because the forms of thinking just described—critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving—are broad and educationally important, it is not surprising that educators have identified a lot of strategies to encourage their development. There are so many possibilities, in fact, that just keeping them all in mind—let alone choosing among them—can be difficult...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Major Instructional Strategies|(read more...)]]

===Lectures and Readings===
Lectures and readings are traditional staples of educators, particularly when teaching older students (including university students!). At their best, they are the good examples of pre-organized information, so that the student only has to remember what was said in the lecture or written in the text in order to begin understanding it...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Major Instructional Strategies|(read more...)]]

===Mastery learning===
This term refers to an instructional approach in which all students learn material to an identical, high level, even if some students require more time than others to do so (Gentile, 2004). In mastery learning the teacher directs learning, though sometimes only in the indirect sense of finding, writing, and orchestrating...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Mastery Learning|(read more...)]]

===Direct instruction===
Sometimes this term serves as a synonym for teacher-directed instruction, but more often direct instruction refers to a relatively scripted version of mastery learning, meaning that it not only organizes the curriculum into small modules or units, but it also dictates how teachers should teach, including...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Mastery Learning|(read more...)]]

Many teacher-directed strategies have been combined by Madeline Hunter into a single, relatively comprehensive approach that she calls mastery teaching (not to be confused with the related term mastery learning) or the effective teaching model......[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Mastery Learning|(read more...)]]

==Student-centered models of learning==
Student-centered models of learning shift some of the responsibility for directing and organizing learning from the teacher to the student. Being student-centered does not mean, however, that a teacher gives up organizational and leadership responsibilities completely. It only means.........[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Student-Centered Models of Learning|(read more...)]]

==Instructional strategies: An abundance of choices==
Looking broadly at this chapter, you can see that choices among instructional strategies are numerous indeed, and that deciding among them depends on the forms of thinking that you want to encourage, the extent to which ideas or skills need to be organized by you to be understood by students, and the extent to which students need to take responsibility for directing their own learning. Although you may have personal preferences among possible instructional strategies, the choice will also be guided by the uniqueness of each situation of teaching—with its particular students, grade-level, content, and purposes. If you need to develop students’ [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Problem-Solving|problem solving skills]], for example, there are strategies that are especially well suited for this purpose; we described some earlier in this chapter. If you need to [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Major Instructional Strategies|organize complex information]] so that students do not become confused by it, there are effective ways of doing so in the section of this chapter called &quot;[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Major Instructional Strategies|Major Instructional Strategies]]&quot;. If you want the [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Student-Centered Models of Learning|students to take as much initiative as possible]] in organizing their own learning, this too can be done.
Yet having this knowledge is still not enough to teach well. What is still needed are ideas or principles for deciding what to teach. In this chapter we have still not addressed an obvious question: How do I find or devise goals for my teaching and for my students’ learning? And assuming that I can determine the goals, where can I find resources that help students to meet them? We turn to these questions in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning|Chapter 9]], which about planning instruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Selecting general learning goals==
:''“If you don’t know where you’re going, you could end up someplace else.”''
::''--Casey Stengel''

Casey Stengel, a much-admired baseball coach, was talking about baseball when he made this remark. But he could easily have been speaking of teaching as well. Almost by definition, education has purposes, goals, and objectives, and a central task of teaching is to know these are and to transform the most general goals into specific objectives and tasks for students. Otherwise, as Casey Stengel said, students may end up “someplace else” that neither they, nor the teacher, nor anyone else intends. A lot of the clarification and specification of goals needs to happen before a cycle of instruction actually begins, but the benefits of planning happen throughout all phases of teaching. If students know precisely what they are supposed to learn, they can focus their attention and effort more effectively. If the teacher knows precisely what students are supposed to learn, then the teacher can make better use of class time and choose and design assessments of their learning that are more fair and valid. In the long run everyone benefits.

This chapter is therefore about instructional planning, the systematic selection of educational goals and objectives and their design for use in the classroom. We will divide this idea into four parts, and discuss them one at a time. First is the problem of ''selecting general goals'' to teach; where can a teacher find these, and what do they look like? Second is the problem of ''transforming goals into specific objectives'', or statements concrete enough to guide daily activity in class; what will students actually do or say into order to learn what a teacher wants them to learn? Third is the problem of ''balancing and relating goals and objectives to each other''; since we may want students to learn numerous goals, how can we combine or integrate them so that the overall classroom program does not become fragmented or biased? And fourth is the challenge of ''relating instructional goals to students’ prior experiences and knowledge''. We have discussed this challenge before from the perspective of [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|learning theory]] (in Chapter 2), but in this chapter we look at it from the more practical perspective of curriculum planning.

==Selecting General Learning Goals==
At the most general or abstract level, the goals of education include important philosophical ideas like “developing individuals to their fullest potential” and “preparing students to be productive members of society.” Few teachers would disagree with these ideas in principle, though they might disagree about their wording or about their relative importance. As a practical matter, however, teachers might have trouble translating such generalities into specific lesson plans or activities for the next day’s class. What does it mean, concretely, to “develop an individual to his or her fullest potential”? Does it mean, for example, that a language arts teacher should ask students to write an essay about their personal interests, or does it mean that the teacher should help students learn to write as well as possible on any topic, even ones that are not of immediate interest? And what exactly should a teacher do, from day to day, to “prepare students to be productive members of society” as well? Answers to questions like these are needed to plan instruction effectively. But the answers are not obvious simply by examining statements of general educational goals.

===National and State Learning Standards===
Some (but not all) of the work of transforming such general purposes into more precise teaching goals and even more precise objectives has been performed by broad national organizations that represent educators and other experts about particular subjects or types of teaching (Riley, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Riley, R. (2002). Education reform through standards and partnerships, 1993-2000. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 83''(9), 700-707.&lt;/ref&gt;. The groups have proposed national standards, which are summaries of what students can reasonably be expected to learn at particular grade levels and in particular subjects areas. In the United States, in addition, all state governments create state standards that serve much the same purpose: they express what students in the state should (and hopefully can) learn at all grade levels and in all subjects. Examples of organizations that provide national standards are listed in [[Table 9-1]], and examples of state standards are listed in [[Table 9-2]] for one particular state, Ohio, in the area of language arts.

Because they focus on grade levels and subject areas, general statements of educational standards tend to be a bit more specific than the broader philosophical goals we discussed above. As a rule of thumb, too, state standards tend to be more comprehensive than national standards, both in coverage of grade levels and of subjects. The difference reflects the broad responsibility of states in the United States for all aspects of public education; national organizations, in contrast, usually assume responsible only for a particular subject area or particular group of students. Either type of standards provides a first step, however, toward transforming the grandest purposes of schooling (like developing the individual or preparing for society) into practical classroom activities. But they provide a first step only. Most statements of standards do not make numerous or detailed suggestions of actual activities or tasks for students, though some might include brief classroom examples—enough to clarify the meaning of a standard, but not enough to plan an actual classroom program for extended periods of time. For these latter purposes, teachers rely on more the detailed documents, the ones often called curriculum frameworks and curriculum guides.

===Curriculum Frameworks and Curriculum Guides===
The terms curriculum framework and curriculum guide sometimes are used almost interchangeably, but for convenience we will use them to refer to two distinct kinds of documents. The more general of the two is curriculum framework, which is a document that explains how content standards can or should be organized for a particular subject and at various grade levels. Sometimes this information is referred to as the scope and sequence for a curriculum. A curriculum framework document is like a standards statement in that it does not usually provide a lot of detailed suggestions for daily teaching. It differs from a standards statement, though, in that it analyzes each general standard in a curriculum into more specific skills that students need to learn, often a dozen or more per standard. The language or terminology of a framework statement also tends to be somewhat more concrete than a standards statement, in the sense that it is more likely to name behaviors of students—things that a teacher might see them do or hear them say. Sometimes, but not always, it may suggest ways for assessing whether students have in fact acquired each skill listed in the document. [[Table 9-3]] shows a page from a curriculum framework published by the California State Board of Education (Curriculum Development and Supplemental Materials Committee, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Curriculum Development and Supplemental materials Commission. (1999). ''Reading/Language Arts Framework for California Public Schools.'' Sacramento, CA:
California Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this case the framework explains the state standards for learning to read, and the excerpt in [[Table 9-3]] illustrates how one particular standard, that “students speak and write with command of English conventions appropriate to this grade level,” is broken into nine more specific skills. Note that the excerpt names observable behaviors of students (what they do or say); we will discuss this feature again, more fully, in the next part of this chapter, because it is helpful in classroom planning. In spite of this feature, though, the framework document does not lay out detailed activity plans that a teacher could use on a daily basis. (Though even so, it is over 300 pages long!)

Teachers’ need for detailed activity suggestions is more likely to be met by a curriculum guide, a document devoted to graphic descriptions of activities that foster or encourage the specific skills explained in a curriculum framework document. The descriptions may mention or list curriculum goals served by an activity, but they are also likely to specify materials that a teacher need, time requirements, requirements for grouping students, drawings or diagrams of key equipment or materials, and sometimes even suggestions for what to say to students at different points during the activity. In these ways the descriptions may resemble lesson plans.

Since classroom activities often support more than one specific skill, activities in a curriculum guide may be organized differently than they might be in a framework document. Instead of highlighting only one standard at a time, as the framework document might, activities may be grouped more loosely—for example, according to the dominant purpose or goal of an activity (“Activities that encourage the practice of math facts”) or according to a dominant piece of equipment or material (“Ten activities with tin cans”). [[Table 9-4]] shows a description of a kindergarten-level activity about “autumn leaves” that might appear in a curriculum guide. Note that the activity meets several educational objectives at once—tracing shapes, knowledge of leaves and of colors, descriptive language skill. Each of these skills may reflect a different curriculum standard.

==Formulating learning objectives==
Given curriculum frameworks and guides like the ones just described, how do you choose and formulate actual learning objectives? Basically there are two approaches: either start by selecting content or topics that what you want students to know (the cognitive approach) or start with what you want students to do (the behavioral approach)....[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning/Formulating Learning Objectives|(read more...)]]

===Taxonomies of educational objectives===
When educators have proposed taxonomies of educational objectives, they have tended to focus on one of three areas or domains of psychological functioning: either students’ cognition (thought), students’ feelings and emotions (affect), or students’ physical skills (psychomotor abilities). Of these three areas, they have tended to focus the most attention on cognition. The taxonomy originated by Benjamin Bloom, for example, deals entirely with cognitive outcomes of instruction...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning/Taxonomies of Educational Objectives|(read more...)]]

==Students as a source of instructional goals==
So far our discussion of instructional planning has described goals and objectives as if they are selected primarily by educators and teachers, and not by students themselves. The assumption may be correct in many cases, but there are problems with it. One problem is that choosing goals and objectives for students, rather than by students, places a major burden on everyone involved in education—curriculum writers, teachers, and...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning/Students and Instructional Goals|(read more...)]]

==Enhancing student learning through a variety of resources==
Whether instructional goals originate from curriculum documents, students’ expressed interests, or a mixture of both, students are more likely to achieve the goals if teachers draw on a wide variety of resources. As a practical matter, this means looking for materials and experiences that supplement—or occasionally even replace—the most traditional forms of information, such as textbooks...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning/Enhancing Learning with Variety of Resources|(read more...)]]

==Creating bridges among curriculum goals and students’ experiences==
To succeed, then, instructional plans do require a variety of resources, like the ones discussed in the previous section. But they also require more: they need to connect with students’ prior experiences and knowledge. Sometimes the connections can develop as a result of...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning/Creating Bridges with Students' Experiences|(read more...)]]

==Planning for instruction as well as for learning==
This chapter started with one premise but ended with another. It started with the idea that teachers need to locate curriculum goals, usually from a state department of education or a publisher of a curriculum document. In much of the chapter we described what these authorities provide for individual classroom teachers, and how their documents can be clarified and rendered specific enough for classroom use. In the middle of the chapter, however, the premise shifted. We began noting that instruction cannot be planned simply for students; teachers also need to consider involving students themselves in influencing or even choosing their own goals and ways of reaching the goals. Instructional planning, in other words, has to be not just for students, but also by students, at least to some extent. In the final parts of the chapter we described a number of ways of achieving a reasonable balance between teachers’ and students’ influence on their learning. We suggested considering relatively strong measures, such as an emergent or an anti-bias curriculum, but we also considered more moderate ones, like the use of the Internet, of local experts and field trips, of service learning, and of guided and independent practice. All things considered, then, teachers’ planning is not just about organizing teaching; it is also about facilitating learning. Its dual purpose is evident in many features of public education, including the one we discuss in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies|Chapter 10]] and [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments|Chapter 11]], which concern the assessment of learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Kym teaches 6th grade students in an urban school where most of the families in the community live below the poverty line. Each year the majority of the students in her school fail the state-wide tests. Kym follows school district teaching guides and typically uses direct instruction in her Language Arts and Social Studies classes. The classroom assessments are designed to mirror those on the state-wide tests so the students become familiar with the assessment format. When Kym is in a graduate summer course on motivation she reads an article called, “Teaching strategies that honor and motivate inner-city African American students” (Teel, Debrin-Parecki, &amp; Covington, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Teel, K. M., Debrin-Parecki, A., &amp; Covington, M. V. (1998). Teaching strategies that honor and motivate inner-city African American students: A school/university collaboration. ''Teaching and Teacher Education, 14''(5), 479-495. &lt;/ref&gt; and she decides to change her instruction and assessment in Fall in four ways. First, she stresses an incremental approach to ability focusing on effort and allows students to revise their work several times until the criteria are met. Second, she gives students choices in performance assessments (e.g. oral presentation, art project, creative writing). Third, she encourages responsibility by asking students to assist in classroom tasks such as setting up video equipment, handing out papers etc. Fourth, she validates student’ cultural heritage by encouraging them to read biographies and historical fiction from their own cultural backgrounds. Kym reports that the changes in her students’ effort and demeanor in class are dramatic: students are more enthusiastic, work harder, and produce better products. At the end of the year twice as many of her students pass the State-wide test than the previous year.''

:'''''An Afterward...:''' Kym still teaches 6th grade in the same school district and continues to modify the strategies described above. Even though the performance of the students she taught improved the school was closed because, on average, the students’ performance was poor. Kym gained a Ph.D. and teaches Educational Psychology to preservice and inservice teachers in evening classes.''

Kym’s story illustrates several themes related to assessment that we explore in this chapter on teacher-made assessment strategies and in the next chapter on standardized testing. First, choosing effective classroom assessments is related to instructional practices, beliefs about motivation, and the presence of state-wide standardized testing. Second, some teacher-made classroom assessments enhance student learning and motivation, but others do not. Third, teachers can improve their teaching through action research. This involves identifying a problem (e.g., low motivation and achievement), learning about alternative approaches (e.g., reading the literature), implementing the new approaches, observing the results (e.g. students’ effort and test results), and continuing to modify the strategies based on their observations.
 
Best practices in assessing student learning have undergone dramatic changes in the last 20 years. When Rosemary [a contributor to this chapter] was a mathematics teacher in the 1970’s, she did not assess students’ learning that she tested them on the mathematics knowledge and skills she taught during the previous weeks. The tests varied little format and students always did them individually with pencil and paper. Now, however, many teachers--including mathematics teachers--use a wide variety of methods to determine what their students have learned and also use this assessment information to modify their instruction. In this chapter the focus is on using ''classroom'' or teacher-made assessments to improve student learning. (In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments|Chapter 11]] we discuss standardized and other formal assessments of learning. 

==Basic Concepts==
'''Assessment''' is an integrated process of gaining information about students’ learning and making value judgments about their progress (Linn &amp; Miller, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. L., &amp; Miller, M. D. (2005). ''Measurement and Assessment in Teaching  9th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ:  Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Information about students’ progress can be obtained from a variety of sources including projects, portfolios, performances, observations, and tests.  The information about students’ learning is often assigned specific numbers or grades and this involves measurement.  '''Measurement''' answers the question, “How much?” and is used most commonly when the teacher scores a test or product and assigns numbers (e.g., 28 /30 on the biology test; 90/100 on the science project). Evaluation is the process of making judgments about the assessment information (Airasian, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Airasian, P. W. (2004). ''Classroom Assessment: Concepts and Applications 3rd ed.''  Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;. These judgments may be about individual students (e.g., should Jacob’s course grade take into account his significant improvement over the grading period?), the assessment method used (e.g., is the multiple choice test a useful way to obtain information about problem solving), or one’s own teaching (e.g., most of the students this year did much better on the essay assignment than last year so my new teaching methods seem effective). 

The primary focus in this chapter is on assessment ''for'' learning, where the priority is designing and using assessment strategies to enhance student learning and development. Assessment for learning is often called '''formative assessment''', i.e., it takes place during the course of instruction and provides information that teachers can use to revise their teaching and students can use to improve their learning (Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall &amp; Wiliam, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Black, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B. &amp; Wiliam, D. (2004).  Working inside the black box.: Assessment for learning in the classroom.  ''Phi Delta Kappan, 86''(1) 9-21. &lt;/ref&gt;. Formative assessment includes both informal assessment involving spontaneous unsystematic observations of students’ behaviors (e.g., during a question and answer session or while the students are working on an assignment) and formal assessment involving preplanned, systematic gathering of data. Assessment ''of'' learning involves assessing students in order to certify their competence and to fulfill accountability mandates; it is the primary focus of [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments|the next chapter]], which is primarily about standardized tests. Assessment of learning is typically summative, that is, administered after the instruction is completed (e.g., a final examination in an educational psychology course). '''Summative assessments''' provide information about how well students mastered the material, whether students are ready for the next unit, and what grades should be given.
   
==Assessment for Learning: An Overview==
Using assessment to advance students’ learning not just check on learning requires viewing assessment as a process that is integral to the all phases of teaching including planning, classroom interactions and instruction, communication with parents, and self-reflection (Stiggins, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Stiggins, R. J. (2002).  Assessment crisis: The absence of assessment FOR learning. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 83''(10), 758-765. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Essential steps in assessment for learning include:

:''Step 1: Having clear instructional goals and communicating them  to students''
::In the previous chapter we documented the importance of teachers thinking carefully about the purposes of each lesson and unit. This may be hard for beginning teachers. For example, Vanessa, a middle school social studies teacher, might say that the goal of her next unit is, “Students will learn about the civil war.” Clearer goals require that Vanessa decides what it is about the civil wear she wants her students to learn, e.g. the dates and names of battles, the causes of the civil war, the differing perspectives of those living in the North and the South, or the day-to-day experiences of soldiers fighting in the war. Vanessa cannot devise appropriate assessments of her students’ learning about the civil war until she is clear about her own purposes.

::For effective teaching Vanessa also needs to communicate clearly the goals and objectives to her students so they know what is important for them to learn. No matter how thorough a teacher’s planning has been, if students do not know what they are supposed to learn they will not learn as much. Because communication is so important to teachers, a specific chapter is devoted to this topic [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 12: The Nature of Classroom Communication|(Chapter 12)]].

:''Step 2:  Selecting appropriate assessment techniques''
::Selecting and administrating assessment techniques that are appropriate for the goals of instruction as well as the developmental level of the students are crucial components of effective assessment for learning. Teachers need to know the characteristics of a wide variety of classroom assessment techniques and how these techniques can be adapted for various content, skills, and student characteristics. They also should understand the role reliability, validity, and the absence of bias should play is choosing and using assessment techniques. Much of this chapter focuses on this information.

:''Step 3. Using assessment to enhance motivation and confidence 
::Students’ motivation and confidence is influenced by the type of assessment used as well as the feedback given about the assessment results. Consider, Samantha a college student who takes a history class in which the professor’s lectures and text book focus on really interesting major themes. However, the assessments are all multiple choice tests that ask about facts and Samantha, who initially enjoys the classes and readings, becomes angry, loses confidence she can do well, and begins to spend less time on the class material. In contrast, some instructors have has observed that that many students in educational psychology classes like the one you are now taking will work harder on assessments that are case studies rather than more traditional exams or essays. The type of feedback provided to students is also important and we elaborate on these ideas later in this chapter.

:''Step 4:  Adjusting instruction based on information''
::An essential component of assessment for learning is that the teacher uses the information gained from assessment to adjust instruction. These adjustments occur in the middle of a lesson when a teacher may decide that students’ responses to questions indicate sufficient understanding to introduce a new topic, or that her observations of students’ behavior indicates that they do not understand the assignment and so need further explanation. Adjustments also occur when the teacher reflects on the instruction after the lesson is over and is planning for the next day. We provide examples of adjusting instruction in this chapter, but teacher reflection is discussed in more detail in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner|Chapter 13]].

:''Step 5: Communicating with parents and guardians''
::Students’ learning and development is enhanced when teachers communicate with parents regularly about their children’s performance. Teachers communicate with parents in a variety of ways including newsletters, telephone conversations, email, school district websites and parent-teachers conferences. Effective communication requires that teachers can clearly explain the purpose and characteristics of the assessment as well as the meaning of students’ performance. This requires a thorough knowledge of the types and purposes of teacher made and standardized assessments and well as clear communication skills.

In the next sections of this chapter, we consider each of the above steps of assessment in more detail. First, however, we look how teachers can make sure that their assessments are of high quality in the first place.

==Selecting appropriate assessment techniques, Part 1: High quality assessments==
For an assessment to be high quality it needs to have good validity and reliability as well as absence from bias.
 
===Validity=== 
Validity is the evaluation of the “adequacy and appropriateness of the interpretations and uses of assessment results” for a given group of individuals...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-Made Assessment Strategies/Selecting Appropriate Assessments, Part 1|(read more...)]]

===Reliability===
''Reliability'' refers to the consistency of measurement... Suppose that...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-Made Assessment Strategies/Selecting Appropriate Assessments, Part 1|(read more...)]]

==Selecting Appropriate Assessment Techniques, Part 2: Types of Teacher-made Assessments==
One of the challenges for beginning teachers is to select and use appropriate assessment techniques. In this section we summarize the wide variety of types of assessments that classroom teachers use. First we discuss the informal techniques teachers use during instruction that typically require instantaneous decisions. Then we consider formal assessment techniques that teachers plan before instruction and allow for reflective decisions...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies/Selecting Appropriate Assessment Techniques, Part 2|(read more...)]]

===Teacher’s observations, questioning, record keeping===
...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies/Selecting Appropriate Assessment Techniques, Part 2|(read more...)]]
:''Observations''
:''Questioning''
:''Record Keeping''

===Selected response items===
Teachers commonly assess students using questions and items that are multiple choice, matching, or true/false. In ''selected response items'', students choose a response provided by the teacher or test developer, rather than construct a response in their own words or actions...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies/Selected Response Items|(read more...)]]
:''Common problems''
:''Strengths and weaknesses''

===Constructed response items===
Formal assessment also includes constructed response items in which students are asked to recall information and create an answer – not just recognize if the answer is correct...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies/Constructed Response Items|(read more...)]]
:''Completion and short answer''
:''Extended responses''
:''Scoring rubrics''

===Performance assessments===
Typically in performance assessments students complete a specific task while teachers observe the process or procedure (e.g., data collection in an experiment) as well as the product (e.g., completed report). The tasks that students complete in performance assessments are not simple - in contrast to selected response items - and include the following:...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies/Performance Assessments|(read more...)]]

==Grading and Reporting==
Assigning students grades is an important component of teaching and many school districts issue progress reports, interim reports, or mid term grades as well as final semester grades. Traditionally these reports were printed on paper and sent home with students or mailed to students’ homes. Increasingly, school districts are using web-based grade management systems that allow parents to access their child’s grades on each individual assessment as well as the progress reports and final grades.

==Summary of Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies==
The purpose of classroom assessment can be assessment for learning or assessment of learning. Essential steps of assessment for learning include communicating instructional goals clearly to students; selecting appropriate high quality assessments that match the instructional goals and  students’ backgrounds; using assessments that enhance student motivation and confidence, adjusting instruction based on assessment, and communicating assessment results with parents and guardians. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner|Action research]], also discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner|Chapter 13]], can help teachers understand and improve their teaching.  A number of educational issues have to be balanced when devising grading systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Understanding standardized testing is very important for beginning teachers as K-12 teaching is increasingly influenced by the administration and results of standardized tests. Teachers also need to be able to help parents and students understand test results. Consider the following scenarios.
:''Vanessa, a newly licensed Physical Education teacher, is applying for a job at a middle school. During the job interview the principal asks how she would incorporate key 6th grade math skills into her PE and Health classes as the 6th grade students in the previous year did not attain Adequate Yearly Progress in mathematics.''
:''Danielle, a 1st year Science teacher in Ohio, is asked by Mr. Volderwell, a recent immigrant from Turkey and the parent of a 10th grade son Marius, to help him understand test results. When Marius first arrived at school he took the Test of Cognitive Skills and scored on the 85th percentile whereas on State Science Graduation test he took later in the school year he was classified as “proficient.”''
:''James, a 3rd year elementary school teacher, attends a class in gifted education over summer as standardized tests from the previous year indicated that while overall his class did well in reading the top 20% of his students did not learn as much as expected.''
:''Miguel, a 1st grade student, takes two tests in fall and the results indicate that his grade equivalent scores are 3.3 for reading and 3.0 for math. William’s parents want him immediately promoted into the 2nd grade arguing that the test results indicate that he already can read and do math at the 3rd grade level. Greg,, a 1st grade teacher explains to William’s parents that a grade equivalent score of 3.3 does not mean William can do 3rd grade work.''

Understanding standardized testing is difficult, as there are numerous terms and concepts to master and recent changes in accountability under the '''No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)''' have increased the complexity of the concepts and issues. In this chapter we focus on the information that beginning teachers need to know and begin with some basic concepts. 

==Basic Concepts==
'''Standardized tests''' are created by a team – usually test experts from a commercial testing company who consult classroom teachers and university faculty – and are administered in standardized ways. Students not only respond to the same questions they also receive the same directions and have the same time limits. Explicit scoring criteria are used. Standardized tests are designed to be taken by many students within a state, province, or nation, and sometimes across nations. Teachers help administer some standardized tests and test manuals are provided that contain explicit details about the administration and scoring. For example, teachers may have to remove all the posters and charts from the classroom walls, read directions out loud to students using a script, and respond to student questions in a specific manner. 

'''Criterion referenced''' standardized tests measure student performance against a specific standard or criterion. For example, newly hired firefighters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have to meet physical fitness standards by successfully completing a standardized physical fitness test that includes stair climbing, using a ladder, advancing a hose, and simulating a rescue through a doorway (Human Resources Division, n.d.)&lt;ref&gt;Human Resources Division (n.d.). Firefighter Commonwealth of Massachusetts Physical Abilities Test (PAT) Accessed November, 19, 2006 from http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=hrdtopic&amp;L=2&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Civil+Service&amp;sid=Ehrd&lt;/ref&gt;. Criterion-referenced tests currently used in US schools are often tied to State content standards and provide information about what students can and cannot do. For example, one of the content standards for 4th grade reading in Kentucky is “Students will identify and describe the characteristics of fiction, nonfiction, poetry or plays” (Combined Curriculum Document Reading 4.1, 2006) and so a report on an individual student would indicate if the child can accomplish this skill. The report may state that number or percentage of items that were successfully completed (e.g. 15 out of 20,  i.e., 75%) or include descriptions such as basic, proficient, or advanced which are based on decisions made about the percent of mastery necessary to be classified into these categories. 

'''Norm-referenced''' standardized tests report students’ performance relative to others. For example, if a student scores on the 72nd percentile in reading it means she outperforms 72 percent of the students who were included in the test’s norm group. A norm group is a representative sample of students who completed the standardized test while it was being developed. For State tests the norm group is drawn from the state whereas for national tests the sample is drawn from the nation. Information about the norm groups is provided in a technical test manual that is not typically supplied to teachers but should be available from the person in charge of testing in the school district. 

Reports from criterion and norm referenced tests provide different information. Imagine a nationalized mathematics test designed to basic test skills in 2nd grade. If this test is norm referenced, and Alisha receives a report indicating that she scored in the 85th percentile this indicates that she scored better than 85% of the students in the norm group who took the test previously. If this test is criterion-referenced Alisha’s report may state that she mastered 65% of the problems designed for her grade level. The relative percentage reported from the norm-referenced test provides information about Alisha’s performance compared to other students whereas the criterion referenced test attempts to describe what  Alisha or any student can or cannot do with respect to whatever the test is designed to measure. When planning instruction classroom teachers need to know what students can and cannot do so criterion referenced tests are typically more useful (Popham, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2005). ''Classroom Assessment: What teachers need to know.'' Boston:, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;. The current standard-based accountability and NCLB rely predominantly on criterion based tests to assess attainment of content-based standards. Consequently the use of standardized norm referenced tests in schools has diminished and is largely limited to diagnosis and placement of children with specific cognitive disabilities or exceptional abilities (Haertel &amp; Herman, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Haertel, E. &amp; Herman, J. (2005) A historical perspective on validity arguments for accountability testing. In  J. L.Herman &amp; E. H. Haertel (Eds.) ''Uses and misuses of data for educational accountability and improvement. 104th Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Some recent standardized tests can incorporate both criterion- referenced and norm referenced elements in to the same test (Linn &amp; Miller, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. L., &amp; Miller, M. D. (2005). ''Measurement and Assessment in Teaching  9th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ:  Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;. That is, the test results not only provide information on mastery of a content standard but also the percentage of students who attained that level of mastery.  

Standardized tests can sometimes be '''high stakes''', meaning that performance on the test has important consequences of some sort. The consequences can be for students, e.g., passing a high school graduation test is required in order to obtain a diploma or passing PRAXIS II is a prerequisite to gain a teacher license. These consequences can be for schools, e.g., under NCLB an increasing percentage of students in every school must reach proficiency in math and reading each year. Consequences for schools who fail to achieve these gains include reduced funding and restructuring of the school building. Under NCLB, the consequences are designed to be for the schools, not individual students, and the test results may not accurately reflect what students know because the students may not try hard when the tests have low stakes for them (Wise &amp; DeMars, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Wise, S. L. &amp; DeMars, C. W. (2005). Low examinee effort in low-stakes assessment: Problems and potential solutions. ''Educational Assessment 10''(1), 1-17. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Uses of standardized tests===
Standardized tests are used for a variety of reasons and the same test is sometimes used for multiple purposes. The uses include:

'''Assessing Students’ Progress in a Wider Context''' Well-designed teacher assessments provide crucial information about each student’s achievement in the classroom. However, teachers vary in the types of assessment they use so teacher assessments do not usually provide information on how students’ achievement compares to externally established criteria. Consider two 8th grade students, Brian and Joshua, who received A’s in their middle school math classes. However, on the standardized norm-reference math test Brian scored on the 50th percentile whereas Joshua scored on the 90th percentile. This information is important to Brian and Joshua, their parents, and the school personnel. Likewise, two 3rd grade students could both receive C’s on their report card in reading but one may pass 25% and the other 65% of the items on the criterion referenced state test.

There are many reasons that students’ performance on teacher assessments and standardized assessments may differ. Students may perform lower on the standardized assessment because their teachers have easy grading criteria, or there is poor alignment between the content they were taught and that on the standardized test, or they are unfamiliar with the type of items on the standardized tests, or they have test anxiety, or they were sick on the day of the test. Students may perform higher on the standardized test than on classroom assessments because their teachers have hard grading criteria, or the student does not work consistently in class (e.g., doesn’t turn in homework) but will focus on a standardized test, or the student is adept at the multiple choice items on the standardized tests but not at the variety of constructed response and performance items the teacher uses. We should always be very cautious about drawing inferences from one kind of assessment. 

In some states, standardized achievement tests are required for home schooled students in order to provide parents and state officials information about the students’ achievement in a wider context. For example, in New York home schooled students must take an approved standardized test every other year in grades 4-8 and every year in grades 9-12. These tests must be administered in a standardized manner and the results filed with the Superintendent of the local school district. If a student does not take the tests or scores below the 33rd percentile the home schooling program may be placed on probation (New York State Education Department, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;New York State Education Department (2005). ''Home Instruction in New York State.'' Accessed on November 19, 2006 from  [[http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/nonpub/part10010.htm]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''Diagnosing Student’s Strengths and Weaknesses''' Standardized tests, along with interviews, classroom observations, medical examinations, and school records are used to help diagnose students’ strengths and weaknesses. Often the standardized tests used for this purpose are administered individually to determine if the child has a disability. For example, if a kindergarten child is having trouble with oral communication, a standardized language development test could be administered to determine if there are difficulties with understanding the meaning of words or sentence structures, noticing sound differences in similar words, or articulating words correctly. It would also be important to determine if the child was a recent immigrant, had a hearing impairment or mental retardation. The diagnosis of learning disabilities typically involves the administration of at least two types of standardized tests – an aptitude test to assess general cognitive functioning and an achievement test to assess knowledge of specific content areas (Peirangelo &amp; Giuliani, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Peirangelo, R. &amp; Guiliani, G. (2006). ''Special education assessment.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. We discuss the difference between aptitude and achievement tests later in this chapter. 

'''Selecting Students for Specific Programs''' Standardized tests are often used to select students for specific programs. For example, the SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) and ACT (American College Test) are norm referenced tests used to help determine if high school students are admitted to selective colleges. Norm referenced standardized tests are also used, among other criteria, to determine if students are eligible for special education or gifted and talented programs. Criterion referenced tests are used to determine which students are eligible for promotion to the next grade or graduation from high school. Schools that place students in ability groups including high school college preparation, academic, or vocational programs may also use norm referenced or criterion referenced standardized tests. When standardized tests are used as an essential criteria for placement they are obviously high stakes for students. 	

'''Assisting Teachers’ Planning''' Norm referenced and criterion referenced standardized tests, among other sources of information about students, can help teachers make decisions about their instruction. For example, if a social studies teacher learns that most of the students did very well on a norm referenced reading test administered early in the school year he may adapt his instruction and use additional primary sources. A reading teacher after reviewing the poor end-of-the year criterion referenced standardized reading test results may decide that next year she will modify the techniques she uses. A biology teacher may decide that she needs to spend more time on genetics as her students scored poorly on that section of the standardized criterion referenced science test. These are examples of assessment for learning which involves data based decision making. It can be difficult for beginning teachers to learn use standardized test information appropriately, understanding that test scores are important information but also remembering that there are multiple reasons for students’ performance on a test.  

'''Promoting Accountability''' Standardized tests results are increasingly used to hold teachers and administrators accountable for students’ learning. Prior to 2002, many Sates required public dissemination of students’ progress but under NCLB school districts in all states are required to send report cards to parents and the public that include results of standardized tests for each school. Providing information about students’ standardized tests is not new as newspapers began printing summaries of students’ test results within school districts in the 1970’s and 1980’s (Popham, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2006). Educator cheating on No Child Left Behind Tests. ''Education Week, 25''(32) 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, public accountability of schools and teachers has been increasing in the US and many other countries and this increased accountability impacts the public perception and work of ''all'' teachers including those teaching in subjects or grade levels not being tested.  

For example, Erin a middle school social studies teacher, said, “as a teacher in a &quot;non-testing&quot; subject area, I spend substantial instructional supporting the standardized testing requirements. For example, our school has instituted &quot;word of the day,” which encourages teachers to use, define, and incorporate terminology often used in the tests (e.g., &quot;compare&quot;, &quot;oxymoron&quot; etc.). I use the terms in my class as often as possible and incorporate them into written assignments. I also often use test questions of similar formats to the standardized tests in my own subject assessments (e.g., multiple choice questions with double negatives, short answer and extended response questions) as I believe that practice in the test question formats will help students be more successful in those subjects that are being assessed.” Accountability and standardized testing are two components of Standards Based Reform in Education that was initiated in the USA in 1980’s. The two other components are academic content standards which are described later in this chapter and teacher quality which was discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|Chapter 1]].
 
====Types of Standardized Tests====
'''Achievement Tests: Summarizing the Past'''. K-12 Achievement tests are designed to assess what students have learned in a specific content area. These tests include those specifically designed by States to access mastery of state academic content standards (see more details below) as well as general tests such as the ''California Achievement Tests, The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Metropolitan Achievement Tests,'' and the ''Stanford Achievement Tests.'' These general tests are designed to be used across the nation and so will not be as closely aligned with State content standards as specifically designed tests. Some States and Canadian Provinces use specifically designed tests to assess attainment of content standards and also a general achievement test to provide normative information. 

Standardized achievement tests are designed to be used for students in Kindergarten though high school. For young children questions are presented orally, and students may respond by pointing to pictures, and the subtests are often un-timed. For example, on ''Iowa Test of Basic Skills''&lt;ref&gt;[[http://www.riverpub.com/]]&lt;/ref&gt; designed for students are young as kindergarten the vocabulary test assesses listening vocabulary. The teacher reads a word and may also read a sentence containing the word. Students are then asked to choose one of three pictorial response options.

Achievement tests are used as one criterion for obtaining a license in a variety of professions including nursing, physical therapy, and social work, accounting, and law. Their use in teacher education is recent and is part of the increased accountability of public education and most States require that teacher education students take achievement tests in order to obtain a teaching license. For those seeking middle school and high school licensure these are tests are in the content area of the major or minor (e.g., mathematics, social studies); for those seeking licenses in early childhood and elementary the tests focus on knowledge needed to teach students of specific grade levels. The most commonly used tests, the PRAXIS II series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org&lt;/ref&gt;, developed by Educational Testing Service, include three types of tests: 

# ''Subject Assessments'' that test general and subject-specific teaching skills and knowledge. They include both multiple-choice and constructed-response test items.
# ''Principles of Learning and Teaching (PLT) Tests'' assess general pedagogical knowledge at four grade levels: Early Childhood, K-6, 5-9, and 7-12. These tests are based on case studies and include constructed-response and multiple-choice items. Much of the content in this textbook is relevant to, and organized to parallel, the PLT tests. 
# ''Teaching Foundations Tests'' assess pedagogy in five areas: multi-subject (elementary), English, Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science. These tests include constructed-response and multiple-choice items.
Which tests teacher education students must take and the scores needed in order to pass each test vary and are determined by each US state. 

'''Diagnostic Tests: Profiling Skills and Abilities''' Some standardized tests are designed to diagnose strengths and weaknesses in skills, typically reading or mathematics skills. For example, an elementary school child may have difficult in reading and one or more diagnostic tests would provide detailed information about three components (Joshi, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, R. M. (2003). Misconceptions about the assessment and diagnosis of reading disability. ''Reading Psychology, 24,'' 247-266.&lt;/ref&gt;:
# word recognition, which includes phonological awareness (pronunciation), decoding, and spelling;
# comprehension which includes vocabulary as well as reading and listening comprehension, and
# fluency.
Diagnostic tests are often administered individually by school psychologists, following standardized procedures. The examiner typically records not only the results on each question but also observations of the child’s behavior such as distractibility or frustration. The results from the diagnostic standardized tests are used in conjunction with classroom observations, school and medical records, as well as interviews with teachers, parents and students to produce a profile of the student’s skills and abilities, and where appropriate diagnose a learning disability.

'''Aptitude Tests: Predicting the Future''' Aptitude tests, like achievement tests, measure what student have learned but rather than focusing on specific subject matter learned in school (e.g.,  Math, Science, English or Social Studies) the test items focus on verbal, quantitative, problem solving abilities that are learned in school or in the general culture (Linn &amp; Miller, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. L., &amp; Miller, M. D. (2005). ''Measurement and Assessment in Teaching, 9th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ:  Pearson . &lt;/ref&gt;. These tests are typically shorter than achievement tests and can be useful in predicting general school achievement. If the purpose of using a test is to predict success in a specific subject (e.g., Language Arts) the best prediction is past achievement in Language Arts and so scores on a Language Arts achievement test would be useful. However when the predictions more general (e.g. success in College) aptitude tests are often used. According to the test developers, both the ACT and SAT Reasoning tests, used to predict success in college, assess general educational development and reasoning, analysis and problem solving as well as questions on mathematics, reading and writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.act.org&lt;/ref&gt; The SAT Subject tests, which focus on mastery of specific subjects like English, history, mathematics, science, and language, are used by some colleges as entrance criteria and are more appropriately classified as achievement tests than aptitude tests even though they are used to predict the future.

Tests designed to assess general learning ability have traditionally been called ''intelligence tests,'' but are now often called ''learning ability tests, cognitive ability tests, scholastic aptitude tests,'' or ''school ability tests''. The shift in terminology reflects the extensive controversy over the meaning of the term intelligence and that its traditional use was associated with inherited capacity. The more current terms emphasize that tests measure developed ability in learning not innate capacity. The ''Cognitive Abilities Test'', for example, assesses K-12 students' abilities to reason with words, quantitative concepts, and nonverbal (spatial) pictures. The ''Woodcock Johnson III'', for another example, contains cognitive abilities tests as well as achievement tests for ages 2 to 90 years&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riverpub.com&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==High Stakes Testing by States==
While many States had standardized testing programs prior to 2000, the number of state-wide tests has grown enormously since then because NCLB required that all states test students in reading and mathematics annually in grades 3-8 and at least once in high school by 2005-6. Twenty three states expanded their testing...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments/High Stakes Testing by States|(read more...)]]

==Understanding Test Results==
In order to understand test results from standardized tests it is important to be familiar with a variety of terms and concepts that are fundamental to “measurement theory” -  the  academic study of measurement and assessment. Two major areas in measurement theory - reliability and validity were discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies|the previous chapter]]; in this chapter we focus on concepts and terms associated with test scores...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments/Understanding Test Results|(read more...)]]

===Issues with Standardized Tests===
Many people have very strong views about the role of standardized tests in education. Some believe they provide an unbiased way to determine an individual’s cognitive skills as well as the quality of a school or district. Others believe that scores from standardized tests are capricious, do not represent what students know, and are misleading...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments/Issues about Standardized Tests|(read more...)]]

:''Do Teachers teach to the Tests?''  
:''Do Students and Educators try to cheat?''

==Summary and Conclusions==
Standardized tests are a fact of life for classroom teachers. It is important therefore to understand what they can--and can ''not''--do. Broadly speaking, the tests either assess achievement, diagnose learning problems, or predict future academic performance. For better or for worse, test results are often also used for &quot;high stakes&quot; purposes: assessing whether students, teachers, and/or whole schools are accomplishing what they are supposed to accomplish academically. Because of their nature and limitations, standardized tests are prone to misuse--either by reinforcing social biases, by tempting teachers to teach to the test, by tempting students to cheat when taking them, or even by tempting teachers to cheat in reporting scores.

      <text xml:space="preserve">::''“Be sincere; be brief; be seated.”''
:::''--Franklin Delano Roosevelt''

Franklin Roosevelt was a former President of the United States, and he advised being brief and sincere when communicating. The advice to be seated was somewhat more ambiguous; maybe he was suggesting that conversation and dialogue are improved by reducing the power differences between individuals. If so, he was giving good advice, though perhaps advice that is also a bit misleading in its simplicity. As teachers, we face almost continual talk at school, supplemented by ample amounts of nonverbal communication—gestures, facial expressions, and other “body language.” Often the talk involves many people at once, or even an entire class, and individuals have to take turns speaking while also listening to others having their turns, or sometimes ignoring the others if a conversation does not concern them. As the teacher, therefore, you find yourself playing an assortment of roles when communicating in classrooms: master of ceremonies, referee—and of course expert source of knowledge. Your challenge is to sort out the roles so that you combine them effectively at the appropriate times. As you learn to do this, interestingly, much of the communication with your students may indeed take on the qualities recommended by Franklin Roosevelt. Often, you will indeed be more sincere and more brief, and you may find yourself minimizing the power differences between you and students.

In this chapter we look at how to move toward these goals. We describe briefly several major features of classroom communication that distinguish it from communication in other familiar situations. Then we explain several techniques, both verbal and nonverbal, that contribute to effective communication, and describe how these manifest themselves in several common activity settings, which we call structures of participation. As you will see, how an activity is organized—its structure of participation—has a major effect on how students communicate with each other and with the teacher.

==Communication in Classrooms vs. Communication Elsewhere==
Classroom events are often so complex that just talking with students can become confusing. It helps to think of the challenge as a problem in communication—or as one expert put it, of “who says what to whom, and with what effect” (Lasswell, 1964)&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1964). The structure and function of communication in society. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''Mass communications.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In classrooms, things often do not happen at an even pace or in a logical order, or with just the teacher and one student interacting while others listen or wait patiently...

==Using Classroom Talk to Stimulate Students’ Thinking==
The various features of classroom talk characterize the communication of most teachers and students, at least when they are in a classroom and “doing school.”  (Communication outside of school is a different matter: then teachers as well as students may speak, listen, and behave quite differently!) As you might suppose, the most desirable balance among the features depends on grade level, curriculum area, and personalities of students or teachers...

:''Promoting a Caring Community''

==The Bottom Line: Messages Sent, Messages Reconstructed==
As we have explained in this chapter, teachers and students communicate in multiple, overlapping ways. Communications may often be expressed in words—but not necessarily and not completely. They may be organized into lectures, questions, discussions, or group projects. They tend to be expressed in particular language registers that we have called simply ''teacher talk'' and ''student talk.'' All things considered, communication obviously serves a wide range of teaching and learning tasks and activities, from stimulating students’ thinking, to orchestrating classroom routines, to managing inappropriate behaviors. It is an intrinsic part of the parts of teaching that involve interaction among class members.

Note, though, that teaching consists of more than interaction among class members. There are times when teachers prepare lessons or activities, for example, without talking to students or anyone else. There are also times when they develop their own skills as teachers—for example, by reading and reflecting, or by attending professional development seminars or workshops—which may involve communication, but not in the sense discussed in this chapter. It is to these other parts of teaching that we turn in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner|Chapter 13, &quot;The Reflective Practitioner&quot;]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''The experience in reflective teaching is that you must plunge into the doing, and try to educate yourself before you know what it is you’re trying to learn.''
:::''--Donald Schön (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D. (1987, April). ''Educating the reflective practitioner.'' Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;''

Donald Schön, a philosopher and educational researcher, makes an important observation: learning about teaching often means making choices and taking actions without knowing in advance quite what the consequences will be. The problem, as we have pointed out more than once, is that classroom events are often ambiguous and ambivalent, in that they usually serve more than one purpose. A teacher compliments a student’s contribution to a discussion: at that moment she may be motivating the student, but also focusing classmates’ thinking on key ideas. Her comment functions simultaneously as behavioral reinforcement, information, and expression of caring. At that moment complimenting the student may be exactly the right thing to do. Or not: perhaps the praise causes the teacher to neglect the contributions of others, or focuses attention on factors that students cannot control, like their ability instead of their effort. In teaching, it seems, everything cuts more than one way, signifies more than one thing. The complications can make it difficult to prepare for teaching in advance, though they also make teaching itself interesting and challenging.

The complications also mean that teachers need to learn from their own teaching by reflecting (or thinking about the significance of) their experiences. In the classrooms, students are not the only people who need to learn. So do teachers, though what teachers need to learn is less about curriculum and more about students’ behavior and motivation, about how to assess their learning well, and about how to shape the class into a mutually supportive community. 

Thinking about these matters helps to make a teacher a '''reflective practitioner''' (Schön, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D. (1983). ''The reflective practitioner.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;—a professional who learns both from experience and about experience. Becoming thoughtful helps you in all the areas discussed in this text: it helps in understanding better how students’ learning occurs, what motivates students, how you might differentiate your instruction more fully, and how you can make assessments of learning more valid and fair.

Learning to reflect on practice is so important, in fact, that we have referred to and illustrated its value throughout this book. In addition we devote this entire chapter to how you, like other professional teachers, can develop habits of reflective practice in yourself. In most of this chapter we describe what reflective practice feels like as an experience, and offer examples of places, people, and activities that can support your own reflection on practice. We finish by discussing how teachers can also learn simply by observing and reflecting on their own teaching systematically, and by sharing the results with other teachers and professionals. We call this activity teacher research or action research. As you will see, reflective practice not only contributes to teachers’ ability to make wise decisions, but also allows them to serve as effective, principled advocates on behalf of students.


==Types of resources for professional development and learning==
At some level reflection on practice is something you must do for yourself, since only you have had your particular teaching experiences, and only you can choose how to interpret and make use of them. But this rather individual activity also benefits from the stimulus and challenge offered by fellow professionals...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner/Resources for Professional Development|(read more...)]]

:''Colleagues as a resource''
:''Professional associations and professional development activities''

==Reading and Understanding Professional Articles==
Although publications about educational issues and research can take many forms, they tend to serve three major purposes in some sort of combination. A publication could either...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner/Understanding Professional Articles|(read more...)]]
:''Three purposes of educational publications''
:''Authors’ assumptions about readers''

==Examples of Professional Publications==
As stated in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner/Understanding Professional Articles|the previous section]], the authors of each of the following examples make particular assumptions about you, the reader. They expect you to have particular background knowledge, to have particular goals, and to do particular intellectual work in reading their material...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner/Examples of Professional Articles|(read more...)]]

:'''Example #1: How do children acquire moral commitments?'''
::''Relevance: A truly universal framework?''
::''The reader’s role: Interested observer of children''
:'''Example #2: Learning disability as a misleading label'''
::''Relevance: A critical framework''
::''The reader’s role: Concerned advocate for social justice''
:'''Example #3: The impact of bilingualism on reading'''
::''Relevance: Framework, but also recommendations for practice''
::''The reader’s role: Both teacher and researcher''

==Action Research: Hearing from teachers about improving practice==
Each of the professional articles just described offers ideas and recommendations that can stimulate reflection about teaching and learning. But they all suffer from a particular limitation: Although they often relate to teachers and classrooms, ''teachers’'' role in influencing in designing and interpreting a study is minimal.  In the world of educational research, persons ''other'' than teachers--typically professors, educational administrators, or other professional researchers—tend to speak on behalf of teachers...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner/Action Research|(read more...)]] 

:''The nature of action research''
:''Action research in practice''

::''Example #1: Focusing on motivating students''
::''Example #2: Focusing on development''
::''Example #3: Focusing on collaboration''

==The challenges of action research==
Well and good, you may say.  Action research offers teachers a way to hear each other, to learn from their own and other's experience.  But there are also a few cautions to keep in mind, both ethical and practical. Look briefly at each of these areas...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner/Cautions and Challenges of Action Research|(read more...)]]

:'''Ethical cautions about action research'''
::''Insuring privacy of students''
::''Gaining informed consent''
::''Insuring freedom to participate''
:'''Practical issues about action research'''

==Benefiting from All Kinds of Research==
Although many educators feel a degree of sympathy for the nature and purposes of action research, we contributors to this Wikibook are not trying to advocate for it at the expense of other forms of research, nor at the expense of simply reading and understanding professional publications in general. The challenge for you, as a classroom teacher, is to find the value in ''all'' forms of professional development, whether it be participation in a professional association, reading general articles about research, or engaging in your own action research.

To the extent that you draw on them all, your ways of learning about teaching will be enriched.  You will acquire more ways to understand classroom life, while at the same time acquiring perspective on that life.  You will learn ways to grasp the individuality of particular students, but also to see what they need in common.  You will have more ways to interpret your own experiences as a professional teacher, but also be able to learn from the professional experience of others.  Realizing these benefits fully is a challenge, because the very diversity of classrooms renders problems about teaching and learning complex and diverse as well.  But you will also gain good, professional company in searching for better understanding of your work—company that includes both educational researchers, other professional teachers, and of course your students.

The section called &quot;Understanding Test Results&quot; needs figures and graphs and diagrams badly, as per the examples discussed in that section of the chapter. Without them, the discussion makes little sense. I wonder if there are open-source examples that can be used from Wikipedia, etc., since the concepts being discussed are basic ones about statistical inference?

== Basic Text for Chapter 11 now posted ==

The basic text for Chapter 11 is now posted. Adding the tables and figures should be a comparatively high priority (higher than for most other chapters) because the text relies on them more than usual. There is also some need for other forms of minor clean-up.

==Introduction==

Celestia uses OpenGL graphics routines to draw its pictures of the universe. Unlike DirectX, which is available only on computers running Windows, OpenGL graphics libraries are available for many different types of operating systems.
[http://www.opengl.org/ OpenGL] was originally developed by [http://www.sgi.com/ SGI] but now is available for use on almost all computers and graphics hardware. 
The [[OpenGL|OpenGL WikiBook]] has more details.

Celestia can run on most computers, but to see all of its &quot;eye candy&quot; a modern graphics card implementing OpenGL v2.0 is essential. Even when the best available graphic cards have been installed, some computers have problems running Celestia because their graphics drivers are out of date or buggy. Regularly check the Web site of the manufacturer of your computer or of your graphics card to make sure you have the current driver version. Updated drivers are provided often.

==Graphics Card Limitations==

Many graphics card limitations are described in Celestia's list of [[Celestia/FAQs|Frequently Asked Questions]]:
:[[Celestia/FAQs#I_want_to_see_all_possible_Celestia_eye_candy._What_kind_of_graphics_card_should_I_get.3F| What graphics card should I get?]]

==Operating System Limitations==

Many computer and O/S limitations are described in Celestia's list of [[Celestia/FAQs|Frequently Asked Questions]].

===Linux===
{{sectstub}}

===Mac OS X===

* Graphics driver updates for Mac OS X are available in updates to Mac OS X itself, not in general as separate driver updates by NVIDIA or ATI. This means &quot;upgrade your driver&quot; on OS X means &quot;make sure your version of OS X is up-to-date&quot;. You may have to spend money in order to get the current version of OS X.

* Point sprite primitives do not work on versions of OS X earlier than 10.4.
* Point sprites are not supported properly on Tiger (PPC and Intel architectures). Colors may appear incorrect, and hard freezes requiring a reset have been seen. VBO seems to be involved. Apple has been made aware that this is almost certainly a driver bug, but no fixes have been promised. Behavior on Leopard is unknown.
* The OpenGL 2.0 render path is only supported on Tiger 10.4.3 or later, regardless of the graphics card.
* &lt;strike&gt;Holes may appear in orbit paths on certain ATI configs. A workaround is being investigated.&lt;/strike&gt; Fixed in 1.5.0.

===Windows===

* The graphics drivers provided with your brand new computer hardware already are obsolete. Usually several months have passed between the time its software was configured and it was provided to you. Be sure to download and install the most recent graphics drivers provided on the Web site of the manufacturer of your computer's graphics hardware.

* Windows XP includes a software-only OpenGL library. It's used on systems without 3D hardware or when hardware acceleration is disabled in the Display Control Panel. It implements only OpenGL v1.1, Celestia's Basic rendering path, so it has limited functionality and runs rather slowly, but it is relatively bug-free.

* Celestia does ''not'' use DirectX, which is Microsoft's proprietary 3D graphics programming library. Unfortunately, whenever Microsoft's DirectX libraries are updated, the manufacturer's OpenGL drivers are replaced by obsolete versions provided by Microsoft. Whenever you update DirectX, be sure to reinstall the graphics drivers using the most recent versions provided by the manufacturer of your computer's graphics hardware.

If you have [http://www.shatters.net/celestia/download.html  downloaded] the Windows version of the Celestia installation executable, then you simply need to '''run'''
the .EXE file you downloaded.

Windows XP is the preferred OS at the moment, but you can also setup Celestia in Windows Vista or Windows 7.

A few words of '''caution''' to Windows Vista users, however... (These may also apply to Windows 7.)

If you run the setup program as a Windows XP-compatible application, you'll find that the program runs fine and that Celestia
operates as it should. You can also run the Celestia executable in the native Windows Vista mode too.

Savvy Windows XP users will find that there are a ''lot'' of things to get used to in the XP-compatible mode though. If you modify a planet texture, for example, you may find that your modified texture was NOT saved to the Celestia program
directory where you got it from originally.

Vista likes to create shortcuts to modified textures, and these - for some reason - aren't readily available to the Celestia
program. If you're using Windows Explorer to view the Celestia texture files, click on the &quot;Compatibility Files&quot; area at the top
of your screen to see your modified texture. If you like, you can then copy and/or move the new texture to the
C:\Program Files\Celestia\textures directory of your choice.


'''Recommendations:''' 

Vista users should install Celestia as a native Vista program. When Celestia is installed as a previous version of Windows-compatible program, it simply causes more problems than it solves.

Vista and Win7 are particularly protective of software installed in the '''Program Files''' directory tree. You will have far fewer problems if you install Celestia somewhere else. You could, for example, create the directory '''C:\MyPrograms\''' and install Celestia there.

==MacOS==
{{sectstub}}

Celestia is provided for Mac OS in a disk image. Once you have downloaded the file, simply open it and then copy the application file &quot;Celestia&quot; from the window that shows up to the &quot;Applications&quot; folder, as for most applications in the Mac OS.

==Linux==
{{sectstub}}
build from source !!!! &lt;br /&gt;
For some odd ( and unknown reason) most repos have OLD versions in them . &lt;br /&gt;
In the case of Ubuntu ,it is split into free and non-free ???? odd seeing as everything IS free . &lt;br /&gt;
Some of the repos even have celestia 1.5 in them ( 1.6.1 is current with 1.7 coming very soon) . &lt;br /&gt;
Also none that i have seen build celestia with SPICE support - so NO spice kernels if installed from an rpm or deb or xz . &lt;br /&gt;
Also there ARE NO prebuilt packages  using qt 4 for KDE4 .So no kde4 /qt 4 prebuild rpm's, or deb's or xz's . &lt;br /&gt;

Every Linux distro dose things a bit different but the major have this in their software repos  &lt;br /&gt;
for example  &lt;br /&gt;
fedora -- &quot; yum install celestia &quot; &lt;br /&gt;
-- but this is WITHOUT spice support  &lt;br /&gt;
OpenSUSE -- &quot; zypper in celestia &quot; &lt;br /&gt;
-- also WITHOUT spice support &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cuisine of Cyprus==

G'day, and welcome to Wikibooks. I just saw your edit to [[Cookbook:Cuisines]], but have reverted it because that page is not for listing specific cuisines, just high-level categories of cuisines. If you think that Cypriot cuisine is sufficiently different from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Turkey|Turkish]] cuisine, then perhaps you could create [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Cyprus]]. If you do, it should be listed on [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean]] and [[Cookbook:European cuisines]].

You could make a quick start on the page by importing the Wikipedia page, [[w:Cuisine of Cyprus]]. An administrator can help you with that, if you list it on [[WB:TW]]. 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]].

That number is the amount of characters added or removed. Green is overall an add, red a delete. The number becomes bold if it is large enough. It helps catch page dumpers and vandals as well as the overall impact a user makes to a page. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:22, 9 August 2007 (UTC)
:Actually, I have found that the number becomes bold only if it is a red (deletion) number larger than about 800. I've added, on occasion, some ten thousand characters and it has not given me a bold green number.

== Possessives of words ending in S ==

I see you just changed a &quot;Mundungus'&quot; into a &quot;Mundungus's&quot; in DH chapter 1. I'm going to quietly suggest that perhaps you should take a look at withinFocus' talk page. It seems that while using apostrophe and s after a trailing s is correct, it is not what JKR uses most of the time, and we seem to have sort of settled on the alternative bare apostrophe. Hobgoblin of small minds and all, I know... but it jars more if we do it one way one place and another way another place, than if we do it always the same (albeit less common) way throughout.

Because of its heritage as part of the FLOSS movement, the GNU/Linux operating system is well-suited to software development.

== Compilers ==
=== GNU Compiler Collection ===
==== gcc ====
gcc, which stands for GNU C compiler, is a [[w:C (programming language)|C]] compiler. It can be used for compiling C programs.
==== g++ ====
g++, which stands for GNU C++ compiler, is a [[w:C++|C++]] compiler. It can be used for compiling C++ programs.

==== gfortran ====
gfortran is GNU's compiler for the Fortran 95 language.

====gcj====
gcj, which stands for GNU Java compiler, is a compiler that can compile [[w:Java (programming language)|Java]]. Though not complete, it can already compile simple Java programs.
==== OpenJDK ====
Most modern distributions (2010) include OpenJDK in their repositories which mostly implements the standard Java Sun (now Oracle) JDK.

=== Mono ===
[[w:Mono (software)|Mono]] is a Linux implementation of the .NET Framework.

== Scripting Languages ==

==== [[Lisp Programming|Lisp]] ====
Lisp code can be compiled or interpreted, with good compilers producing code that runs almost as fast as [[C]]. It is also used as a scripting language in [[GIMP]] and [[Maxima|Maxima CAS]]

=== Python ===
The success of Python in the Linux platform has been astonishing. Part of the merit comes from the fact that it was designed to be easily embedded in C/C++ programs, so today most major applications in Linux (and GNU apps by extension) have the possibility to be scripted through Python (Blender, Gimp, Inkscape, OpenOffice or Dia are good examples but many others exist). It has also succeeded as a great alternative to Java in the server space mainly because it is much easier to learn and use. (Python was initially designed as a language for introductory programming courses).

The [http://plone.org/ Plone content management system] is probably the biggest success of Python as a server platform offering a full-featured system for content creation through a user friendly web interface that has displaced commercial solutions in many companies. 

[http://www.sagemath.org/ Sagemath] is another example of a successful Python application. It combines many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface offering a real alternative to mathematical software like Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.

WARNING: '''Still it must be advised that Python lacks good support for multi-threading (June 2010) so it will fail in some circumstances when high input-output concurrent load and/or low-latency responses are required.'''

GIMP also includes a python console.

=== R ===
[[R]] is not a general purpose language. R is designed for statistical computing and graphics. It's extremely powerful and today is considered by the experts to have overtaken most commercial solutions around ('''some of them priced more than 200.000 dollars per license!''').

==Editors==
==Version control==
==Building tools==

== IDEs ==
=== Code::Blocks ===
&lt;!--TODO--&gt;&lt;!-- I'll start it off for you, whoever it is who created this section, but to anyone who is knowledgeable with Code::Blocks, please, flesh out this section. For now, I've included a summary and a link to the wikipedia article

--&gt;Code::Blocks is a free and open-source cross-platform IDE for developing code. It is written in and designed for use with C++. Although it is probably possible to configure it to other languages. Read more at the [[w:Code::Blocks|wikipedia article]].

=== [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] ===
Being a Java based application, eclipse runs in any Linux with Java support. In particular, it runs flawlessly with OpenJDK. While it's developed in Java, Eclipse offers excellent support and integration with other platforms. In particular it excels in its support for PHP and C/C++. For example the Eclipse CDP (C/C++ Development plugin) allows for code refactoring, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, integration with the GNU compiler+linker+debugger tool chain. It provides also with automatic &quot;real time&quot; indexing of code, allowing for example to query for a method or variable's references in other files in the workspace.


=== Emacs ===
Emacs can be used as IDE for many languages :&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.gna.org/emacs-ide/ emacs ide for almost all languages (as long as they are supported by Ctags)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.freaks-unidos.net/Using%20GNU%20Emacs%20as%20all-purpose%20IDE using Emacs as your IDE ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[C]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://deep.syminet.com/emacside.html Emacs As Your IDE for C programming, with cscope and Perforce CVS integration by Deepak]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lisp Programming|Lisp]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/emacs-ide.html The Common Lisp Cookbook - Using Emacs as a Lisp IDE]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ruby &lt;ref&gt;[http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/turn-emacs-into-an-ide/ turn-emacs-into-an-ide by Neil Saunders ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geany ===
Geany is a text editor using the GTK2 toolkit with basic features of an integrated development environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. It supports many filetypes and has some nice features.[http://www.geany.org/]


=== IDLE ===
TODO

=== NetBeans ===
Based on Java. Similar to Eclipse. For Linux development Eclipse is preferred since it offers better tools for C/C++/PHP and other languages as well as better integration with GNOME/KDE desktops. NetBeans was originally developed by Sun Microsystems. After its acquisition by Oracle, its future is uncertain, since Oracle offers a different set of tools to its customer base.

=== [http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/ QT Creator] ===
QT Creator is a cross platform development environment based on the QT C++ toolkit. Linux, Windows, Mac, Symbian, Meego OSes are currently (2010) supported. It was originally developed by Trolltech, that in 2008, was acquired by Nokia. Nokia released the QT code under the GPL. QT forms the base of KDE, that along with GNOME are the two most successful desktop environments on Linux. QT, being cross platform, has also been widely used by software companies (apart from Nokia, that standardized on QT, the Skype client is a famous example).

=== Visual Studio .NET ===
[[w:Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] cannot be natively run under Linux. However, you can still run the Visual Studio IDE under Linux by using the [[w:Wine_(software)|Wine]] layer. Visual Studio Express is not supported at this moment. See next section about Mono.
=== Mono Develop ===
Mono is the &quot;native&quot; implementation of .Net by Novell. Mono Develop installs and runs perfectly on any major Linux distribution.

=== VIM + Screen ===
[[Learning the vi Editor/Vim|Vim]] is a powerful text editor with good programming support. It's especially well suited for scripting languages like Perl, Python or SQL. With the help of the &quot;cscope&quot; plugin it also allows to index C/C++/Java code searching for declarations, definitions and references to variables and functions. While really powerful, for complex projects it has been superseded by Eclipse in most situations. Still with the help of &quot;screen&quot;,a powerful terminal multiplexer, it provides an excellent support for development when we need to simultaneously check code, tune complex config txt/xml files, logging output and monitoring system or network. Vim is somewhat difficult to learn when compared to visual tools, since it require memorizing about 30 different commands (Training vim can extends for 10-20 hours). Still it's worth the effort since '''once learned, it's much easier to use''' than a conventional text editor and much faster at editing complex code. It's block mode allows (with a bit of imagination) to even create small text diagrams or use it simultaneously as a text editor or micro-database system.

The diff mode (vimdiff command) mode allows to edit and visually compare changes in two versions of the same file. It's an excellent tool when working with control version systems like subversion or playing with complex configuration files (all those files inside the /etc directory).

==Libraries==

== Code Analysis ==
=== [http://valgrind.org/ Valgrind] ===
Valgrind comprises a set tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. Valgrind can also be used to build new tools. For example, cachegrind, one of the many tools included, allows to profile internal CPU cache L1/L2 usage.

=== [http://sourceware.org/systemtap/ SystemTap] ===
SystemTap offers diagnosis for a running system. SystemTap eliminates the need for the developer to go through the tedious and disruptive instrument, recompile, install, and reboot sequence that may be otherwise required to collect data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Patriots are the modern day manifestation of the Philosophers described in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. As of late, the organization can be described as a force of perpetual war whose sole purpose is to encourage the funding and act of war. In the Metal Gear series the Patriots are alluded to as the main cause of all large scale conflicts between nations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I. EDUCATION IN PRINCIPLE

I-100. EDUCATION NECESSARY

a. Consider, for instance, the revelation of the light of the Name of God, the Educator. Behold, how in all things the evidences of such a revelation are manifest, how the betterment of all beings dependeth upon it. This education is of two kinds. The one is universal. Its influence pervadeth all things and sustaineth them. It is for this reason that God hath assumed the title, &quot;Lord of all worlds.&quot; The other is confined to them that have come under the shadow of this Name, and sought the shelter of this most mighty Revelation. They, however, that have failed to seek this shelter, have deprived themselves of this privilege, and are powerless to benefit from the spiritual sustenance that hath been sent down through the heavenly grace of this Most Great Name: GL:XCIII:189-190

b. man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess...Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom: GL:CXXIII:259-260; TB:161-162

c. The source of crafts, sciences and arts is the power of reflection. Make ye every effort that out of this ideal mine there may gleam forth such pearls of wisdom and utterance as will promote the well-being and harmony of all the kindreds of the earth: TB:72

d. Through the mere revelation of the word &quot;Fashioner,&quot; issuing forth from His lips and proclaiming His attribute to mankind, such a power is released as can produce, through successive ages, all the manifold arts which the hands of man can produce. No sooner is this resplendent word uttered, than its animating energies, stirring within all created things, give birth to the means and instruments whereby such arts can be produced and perfected: GL:LXXIII:141-142

e. Bend your energies to whatever may foster the education of men: GL:V:9

f. Strain every nerve to acquire both inner and outer perfections, for the fruit of the human tree hath ever been and will ever be perfections both within and without. It is not desirable that a man be left without knowledge or skills, for he is then but a barren tree. Then, so much as capacity and capability allow, ye needs must deck the tree of being with fruits such as knowledge, wisdom, spiritual perception and eloquent speech: Baha'u'llah, Bahá'í Education, #9, p. 3

g. Man is even as steel, the essence of which is hidden: through admonition and explanation, good counsel and education, that essence will be brought to light. If, however, he be allowed to remain in his original condition, the corrosion of lusts and appetites will effectively destroy him: Baha'u'llah, Bahá'í Education, #10, p. 3

h. There are many things which will, if neglected, be wasted, and come to nothing. How often in this world do we see a child who has lost his parents and who, unless attention is devoted to his education and training, can produce no fruit. And better off dead than alive is he who produceth no fruit: Baha'u'llah, Bahá'í Education, #11, p. 3

i. Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures: TAB:III:578 ( )

j. From this universal system of education misunderstandings will be expelled from amongst the children of men: SW IV:6, 105-106 ( ); 

k. If life becomes the center of the imperfections of the world of humanity, death is better than life. Non-existence is better than existence. SW III:3, 19; SW IX:8, 94 ( )  

l. Verily, if that babe depart from this world at the age of infancy, it is sweeter and better. In this sense, death is better than life, deprivation than salvation, nonexistence lovelier than existence, the grave better than the palace, and the narrow, dingy tomb better than the spacious, regal home, for in the sight of mankind that child is abased and degraded and in the sight of God weak and defective: SW IX:7, 83-84; BWF, p. 398; TAB:III:579 ( ) 

m. Baha'u'llah declared that children are of two kinds--the mature and the immature: SW VII:15, 142; SW IX:8, 90 ( )

n. The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must therefore hold fast to the tools of perception and knowledge: SWAB:#111, 136(  )

o. Education has a universal influence and the differences caused by it are very great: BWF, p. 319; SAQ, LVII, p. 214 ( ); Thus is it clearly demonstrated that by their essential nature, minds vary as to their capacity, while education also playeth a great role and exerteth a powerful effect on their development: SWAB:#104, 131
	
p. essential that children be reared in Bahá'í way so that they may find happiness in this world and the next: human happiness is founded upon spiritual behaviour: SWAB:#100, 127

q. education is the foundation of human excellence, enables man to work his way to the heights of abiding glory: SWAB:#103, 129

r. education of primary importance: SWAB:#103, 130

s. instruction and rectification and refinement of character of utmost import: SWAB:#111, 137

t. education has great influence...Education must be considered as most important...Education has a universal influence: SAQ:LVII:249

u. man is in need of an educator...Education is a necessity: PUP:329

v. education is the indispensable foundation of all human excellence and alloweth man to work his way to the heights of abiding glory: SWAB:#103, 129
w. One of the most important of undertakings is the education of children, for success and prosperity depend upon service to and worship of God: 'Abdu'l-Baha, Bahá'í Education, #71, p. 27

x.  The child must not be wronged. The ignorant must not be criticized. We must look to some remedy. All the Prophets of God, including Jesus Christ, came for the education of humanity, in order that the immature souls may become mature. ( )

      <text xml:space="preserve">I-200. EDUCATION OBLIGATORY

a. We prescribe unto all men that which will lead to the exaltation of the World of God amongst His servants, and likewise, to the advancement of the world of being and the uplift of souls. to this end, the greatest means is education of the child. To this must each and all hold fast. We have verily laid this charge upon you in manifold Tablets as well as in My Most Holy Book. Well is it with him who deferreth thereto. We ask of God that He will assist each and every one to obey this inescapable command that hath appeared and been caused to descend through the Pen of the Ancient of Days: Baha'u'llah, Bahá'í Education, #6, p. 2

h. education of children is among the most meritorious acts of mankind: SWAB:#103, 129; #106, 133

i. Baha'u'llah counsels the education of all members of society. No individual should be deprived of intellectual training, although each should receive according to capacity. None must be left in the grades of ignorance: PUP:108

j. all must receive training and instruction...Universal education is a universal law: PUP:300

k. the necessity of education for all mankind: PUP:317

l. all mankind shall be educated: PUP:435 m. all mankind should attain knowledge and acquire an education, necessary principle of religious belief and observance, new in this Dispensation: PUP:455

b. knowledge of self: 1) knowledge of self and recognition of that which leadeth unto loftiness or to lowliness, glory of abasement, wealth or poverty: TB:34 2) enable them to attain the knowledge of Him and of themselves: GL:C:205 3) The Purpose of the one true God, exalted be His glory, in revealing Himself unto men is to lay bare those gems that lie hidden within the mine of their true and inmost selves: GL:CXXXII:287 4) gain a true knowledge of your own selves--a knowledge which is the same as the comprehension of Mine own Being. Ye would find yourselves independent of all else but Me, and would perceive, with your inner and outer eye, and as manifest as the revelation of My effulgent Name, the seas of My loving-kindness and bounty moving within you: GL:CLII:326-327 5) True loss is for him whose days have been spent in utter ignorance of his self: TB:156

c. independent consciousness: 1) thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor: AHW:#2 2) the man of insight who will behold the Words of God with his own eyes and rid himself of the opinions and notions of the peoples of the earth: TB:188 3) God endowed man with ears that he may hear the message of reality and conferred upon him the gift of reason by which he may discover things for himself...Man is not intended to see through the eyes of another, hear through another's ears nor comprehend with another's brain: PUP:293 4) The essence of all that We have revealed for thee is Justice, is for man to free himself from idle fancy and imitation, discern with the eye of oneness His glorious handiwork, and look into all things with a searching eye: TB:157

d. realization of divine teachings: 1) observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world: KA:K1 2) mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it: TB:89 3) it is incumbent upon everyone to obey Him in whatsoever God hath ordained: TB:109 4) it is incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to and observe that which hath streamed from Our Most Exalted Pen: TB:130 5) it is incumbent upon everyone to observe that which hath been sent down by Him Who is the Revealer, the All-Knowing: TB:188 6) in every art and skill, God loveth the highest perfection: Baha'u'llah, Bahá'í Education, #20, p. 5

e. attainment to spiritual life: 1) The Prophets and Messengers have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the Straight Path of Truth. the purpose underlying their revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the Most High: GL:LXXXI:156-157

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thankyou for taking the time to create such a great resource on number theory. Would it be possible for a proof of the euler totient function formula (for a composite number) to be added in the future?

==Shor's Algorithm==

The two-torsion factorization section says that there is no known efficient all purpose algorithm for factoring a number into prime factors. But there's Shor's Algorithm, a quantum computer exclusive algorithm which is efficient and essentially all purpose (it doesn't do prime powers, but you can use considerably simpler algorithms for those). Shor's Algorithm also does eventually factor the number through a two-torsion element.  Is it worth a mention? -- [[User:Giematt|Giematt]] ([[User talk:Giematt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Giematt|contribs]]) 22:49, 28 May 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Who invented it? */general cleanup, [[WP:AWB/T|typos fixed]]: programable → programmable using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== What does it do? ==
Computers are designed to do things that require very fast and accurate mathematical ability and memory, but no creativity. Computers can be used to remember information like books or songs, and they can be used to add thousands of numbers per second.

== Who invented it? ==
[[Image:Wilhelm Schickard.jpg|left|thumb|A picture of Wilhelm Schickard, the creator of the first calculator]]
[[Image:Konrad Zuse (1992).jpg|right|thumb|A picture of Konrad Zuse, the creator of the first programmable computer]]
The computer was not invented by any one person, but is rather an evolution of many devices. A German scholar, Wilhelm Schickard, was the first to create a calculator, which is a type of simple computer. However, the first computer that could be taught to do new things, or programmed, was created by Konrad Zuse more than three centuries later. The first personal computer, like the ones that sit on desks, was created by the Computer Terminal Corporation with the Datapoint 2200. Although modern computers are created by many different companies, their operating systems are generally either Windows, developed under Bill Gates, or Mac OS, developed under Steve Jobs.
Also free software based GNU/Linux operating system developed by everyone.

== How does it get power? ==
Computers draw their power from an electrical source, like a plug or a battery.

== How does it work? ==
[[Image:Personal computer, exploded 2.svg|400px|right]]
Modern computers work by taking input, processing it, and returning it as output, millions of times per second.

===Where does it get its input?===
Different types of input come from different places. The keyboard&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; sends letters and numbers to the computer, a mouse&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; sends information on what to do with the cursor, and a microphone sends sounds. Although you don't control it directly, the internet can also send input. Even though all this information is different, it is all transmitted in the same language that all computers use, binary, which is just a series of ones and zeros.

===How does it process this input?===
All the input in the computer is sent to the central processing unit, or CPU&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The binary ones and zeros, or data, go through millions of tiny gates, each of which takes some inputs and returns an output.The CPU's gates also get data from the hard drive&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; of the computer, which remembers information, the CD drive&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, which is where you put disks for the computer to read, and  other parts of the computer. Once the gates have processed all the data, the results are sent from the processor. Some of the results go to the outputs, while others go inside the computer to tell all the other parts of the computer what to do, like telling the hard drive to remember something.

===What happens to the output?===
The outputs of the computer are connected to external devices. The most important device is the screen&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The screen takes its inputs from the computer and understands the data as a picture. The screen then displays the picture on the screen. Another output device is the speakers. They take output from the computer and change it into sound. There is also output that you can't see or hear - for example when the computer sends data to the internet to ask for a web page.

== How does it vary? ==
Computers are created by many different companies. However, almost all CPUs are created by either Intel or AMD, which are both companies. The operating system can be different as well, although the three leading operating systems are Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Different computers have different parts on the inside. Some have better hard drives so they remember more, or better processors so they work faster.

== How has it changed the world? ==
Computers have completely changed the way we solve problems and get things done.

By building up complex software programmes, individuals and groups of people can process information quicker. Scientists are using computer models to test new medicines and study chemical reactions in ways they never could do before.

Computers today are used to manipulate pictures and videos. Sophisticated animations can be constructed on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly being used in television and films. Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds together.

Business and governments use computers for a wide variety of things: books are written, typeset and produced on computers, put into boxes and shipped by machines controlled by computers. The vans which ship those books to bookshops are tracked using computers tied into satellite navigation and tracking systems. When you buy a book in a shop, the till used to take your money is a computer that is often tied into stock control systems. Information from all of those shops can be pulled together to produce reports for businesses and delivered by e-mail. The business may then pay their taxes electronically, and the government manages the services paid for with those taxes using more computer systems.

The role of computers in society is shown whenever there is some kind of panic about computers like the &quot;Y2K problem&quot;. When programmers were designing computers in the 1960s and 70s, they never thought that those systems would be used for a long time, so stored the year as two digits: &quot;70&quot; rather than &quot;1970&quot;. When the year 2000 came around, a lot of time and money was spent fixing this problem. Many predicted that society would break down because of the problems that were caused by computers failing. Thankfully, this did not happen, but it shows just how important computers are to our everyday lives.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
* the transistor, an electronic switch that can be in two positions - either on {1} or off {0}
*Integrated Circuits(IC) which consist of several logic gates

      <text xml:space="preserve">thanks to Hoogli for getting involved &amp; adding this material :)  
ultimately, i'd like to be able to break it down into pages for each sub-category, once there's enough material to make  it worthwhile...

I find this very confusing. I think all it should really say is something like, &quot;There are many different ways of installing or using Ubuntu on your computer.&quot; [[User:MetalGeoff|MetalGeoff]] 02:34, 22 October 2007 (UTC)!

I agree, this page should really just be an overview of the different methods to get Ubuntu on your system.--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:20, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

there is another way to boot ubuntu.  That is from a usb hard drive.  This is the method that I use and is easily setup from a boot cd.  Here is the install instructions that I use.  http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/05/23/install-ubuntu-11-04-on-external-hard-disk/

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Method of Lines==

===Introduction===

The method of lines is an interesting numeric method for solving partial differential equations. The idea is to semi-discretize the PDE into a huge system of (continuous and interdependent) ODEs, which may in turn be solved using the methods you know and love, such as forward stepping Runge-Kutta. This is where the name &quot;method of lines&quot; comes from: the solution is composed of a juxtaposition of lines (curves, more properly).

The method of lines is applicable to IBVPs only. The variables (or variable) that have boundary constraints are discretized, and the (one) variable that is associated with the initial value(s) becomes the independent variable for the ODE solution. Put more formally, the method of lines is obtained when all of the variables are discretized except for one of them, resulting in a coupled system of ODEs.

Pure BVPs, such as Laplace's equation on some terrible boundary, can be solved in a manner similar to Jacobi iteration known as the method of false transients.

===Example Problem===

Consider the following nonlinear IBVP, where &lt;math&gt;h = h(z, t)&lt;/math&gt;:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = 2 \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial z}\right)^2 + h\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial z^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;h(z, 0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;h(0, t) = 1 \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad h(1, t) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


This intimidating [[Partial Differential Equations/Nondimensionalization|nondimensional]] system describes the flow of liquid in an interior corner (&quot;groove&quot;), where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the liquid and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the distance along the axis of the corner. The IBVP states that the corner is initially empty, and that at one end (&lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt;) the height is fixed to 1. Naturally, fluid will flow along &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, increasing &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; until the other boundary (&lt;math&gt;z = 1&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is always zero, is reached. It's worth noting that though this IBVP can't be solved analytically, similarity solutions to the nonlinear PDE exist for some other situations, such as fixed height at z = 0 and no constraint to the right of that.

The boundary values are associated with the spatial variable, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is discretized in space but not time to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points on a uniform grid. Then &lt;math&gt;h(z, t)&lt;/math&gt; is approximated as follows:


:&lt;math&gt;h(i \Delta z, t) \approx h_i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;


So &lt;math&gt;h_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence (or vector) that has an index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; instead of a continuous dependence on &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;; note however that the whole sequence still has a continuous dependence on time. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is an index that runs from 0 to &lt;math&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, note that zero based indexing is being used, so that &lt;math&gt;i = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i = n - 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt;z = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Looking at the boundaries, we know that:


:&lt;math&gt;h_0(t) = 1 \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad h_{n - 1}(t) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


What about the points of the sequence inside the boundaries? Initially (at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;),


:&lt;math&gt;h_i(0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


Suppose now that the right side of the PDE is discretized however you like, so that:


:&lt;math&gt;f_i = \mbox{The spatial discretization of} \quad 2 \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial z}\right)^2 + h\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial z^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;


If, for example, central differences were used, one would eventually arrive at:


:&lt;math&gt;f_i(h_{i - 1}, h_{i}, h_{i + 1}) = \frac{1}{2 (\Delta z)^2}
(h_{i + 1} h_{i + 1} - 2 h_{i + 1} h_{i - 1} + h_{i - 1} h_{i - 1} + 2 h_i (h_{i + 1} - 2 h_i + h_{i - 1}))\,&lt;/math&gt;


To construct the method of lines approximation for this problem, first &lt;math&gt;h(z, t)&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with &lt;math&gt;h_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and then the right side of the equation is replaced with its discretization (the exact equality is a slight abuse of notation):


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(h_i(t)) = f_i\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;h_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; depends continuously on time and nothing else, this differential equation becomes:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d h_i}{d t} = f_i\,&lt;/math&gt;


Putting everything together in one place, the solution to &lt;math&gt;h_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution to the following IVP:


:&lt;math&gt;h_i(0) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(this is the initial value)}\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
 h_0 = 1 \qquad \mbox{(this is the left boundary value)} \\
 \cfrac{d h_1}{d t} = f_1 \\
 \quad \vdots \\
 \cfrac{d h_i}{d t} = f_i \\
 \quad \vdots \\
 \cfrac{d h_{n - 2}}{d t} = f_{n - 2} \\
 h_{n - 1} = 0 \qquad \mbox{(this is the right boundary value)}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;


Solving this problem gives the approximation for &lt;math&gt;h(x, t)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if a second order forward stepping method is used, such as second order Runge Kutta, this solution method will have approximately the same accuracy as the Crank-Nicolson method, but without simultaneous solution of a mess of algebraic equations, which would make a nonlinear problem prohibitively difficult since a tidy matrix solution wouldn't work.

The method of lines is especially popular in electromagnetics, for example, using the Helmholtz equation to simulate the passage of light through a lens for better lens design; the reason for the popularity is that the system of ODEs can (in this case) be solved analytically, so that the accuracy is limited only by the spatial discretization.

A word of caution: an explicit forward stepping method of lines solution bears similarity to a forward stepping finite difference method; so there is no reason to believe that the method of lines doesn't suffer the same stability issues.

===A Third Order TVD RK Scheme in C===

What follows is an efficient TVD RK scheme implemented in C. Memory is automatically allocated per need (but it will just assume that there is no problem in memory allocation) and freed when n = 0. Note that the solution will not be TVD (total variation diminishing) unless the discretization of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is TVD also.

This isn't strictly a method of lines solver, of course; it may find use whenever some large, interdependent vector ODE must be stepped forward.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*
Third order TVD autonomous RK solution. Steps x'(t) = f(x) forward, where x is some vector of size n.
 
x is the address of the first element. x must be an array of size n. f is a function as shown above.
It's fed the address of the first element of x and the index of the element being worked on, n.
Use n = 0 to free memory.
*/
void RK3(double (*f)(double *x, unsigned int i, unsigned int n), double *x, unsigned int n, double delta_t){
 	static double *x1 = NULL, *x2 = NULL;
	static unsigned int N = 0;
	if(n == 0){
		free(x1);
		free(x2);
		x1 = NULL;
		x2 = NULL;
		return;
	}
	if(n &gt; N){
		N = n;
		x1 = realloc(x1, n*sizeof(double));
		x2 = realloc(x2, n*sizeof(double));
	}

	unsigned int i;

	for(i = 0; i != n; i++)
		x1[i] = x[i] + delta_t*f(x, i, n);

	for(i = 0; i != n; i++)
		x2[i] = 3.0/4.0*x[i] + 1.0/4.0*(x1[i] + delta_t*f(x1, i, n));

	for(i = 0; i != n; i++)
		x[i] = 1.0/3.0*x[i] + 2.0/3.0*(x2[i] + delta_t*f(x2, i, n));

}
&lt;/source&gt;

Fortran 90 equivalent:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
subroutine RK3(f, x, n, delta_t, pass)
   double precision, external:: f
   integer         :: n
   double precision:: x(n)
   double precision:: delta_t
   double precision:: pass(*) !-- Parameters for the routine f()
   ! Locals
   double precision:: x1(n), x2(n)

   if (n .eq. 0) return
   x1 = x + delta_t *  f(x, n, pass)
   x2 = 3d0/4d0 * x + 1d0/4d0 * (x1 + delta_t * f(x1, n, pass)) 
   x  = 1d0/3d0 * x + 2d0/3d0 * (x2 + delta_t * f(x2, n, pass)) 
end subroutine RK3
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

f() should be defined as

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
function f(x, n, pass) result (r)
integer:: n
double precision:: f(n)
double precision:: pass(*)
double precision:: r(n)
! START OF CODE
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finite Difference Method==

The finite difference method is a basic numeric method which is based on the approximation of a derivative as a difference quotient. We all know that, by definition:

:&lt;math&gt;
u'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{u(x + \Delta x) - u(x)}{\Delta x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The basic idea is that if &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;small&quot;, then

:&lt;math&gt;
u'(x) \approx \frac{u(x + \Delta x) - u(x)}{\Delta x}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly,

:&lt;math&gt;
u''(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{u(x + \Delta x) - 2 u(x) + u(x - \Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u''(x) \approx \frac{u(x + \Delta x) - 2 u(x) + u(x - \Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

It's a step backwards from calculus. Instead of taking the limit and getting the exact rate of change, we approximate the derivative as a difference quotient. Generally, the &quot;difference&quot; showing up in the difference quotient (ie, the quantity in the numeriator) is called a ''finite difference'' which is a discrete analog of the derivative and approximates the &lt;math&gt;n^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; derivative when divided by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Replacing all of the derivatives in a differential equation ditches differentiation and results in algebraic equations, which may be coupled depending on how the discretization is applied.

For example, the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

may be discretized into:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{u(x, t + \Delta t) - u(x, t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{u(x + \Delta x, t) - 2 u(x, t) + u(x - \Delta x, t)}{\Delta x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
\Big\Downarrow
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t + \Delta t) = u(x, t) + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} (u(x + \Delta x, t) - 2 u(x, t) + u(x - \Delta x, t))
&lt;/math&gt;

This discretization is nice because the &quot;next&quot; value (temporally) may be expressed in terms of &quot;older&quot; values at different positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

This book has been written in order to educate programmers (especially .NET programmers) about the latest trends in Microsoft's .NET Framework. Microsoft .NET 3.0 is a major milestone in the evolution of the .NET framework and this book is equally indispensable as a study material in understading .NET 3.0. 



This book is made up of four units. The first unit comprises a general introduction about the .NET framework and enhancements introduced by .NET2.0 as masterpages. The reason for including a brief introduction of masterpages is that the concept of masterpages shall be in extensive use in .NET Framework 3.0 applications and a coverage of masterpages as an overview seemed a necessity. The second unit comprises a brief overview of the new enhancements brought forth in .NET 3.0 with regard to the use of generic and nullable data types. Unit 3 includes a detailed coverage of the four major components newly introduced in .NET 3.0: Windows Communication Foundation(WCF), Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF), Windows Workflow Foundation(WWF) and Windows Cardspace.It is here that the .NET course actually commences. The fourth and final unit comprises an overview of IIS 7.0 and Windows Powershell, which is the new command-line interface(CLI) introduced by .NET 3.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The metric is now the official system of measurements for sizes and weights in the Philippines. At this writing, however, lumber, shoes, paper, and machine parts are still measured by the English system. Since it will take time to metricize all existing English measurements, the conversion table is provided below to help students adjust themselves to the transition. 

The metric equivalent of the English linear measurements are printed in decimal figures and are mostly in fractions of a meter. To read these fractional measurements which are given in decimal figures, it is suggested that the following simple rule be followed:

All numbers at the left side of the decimal point are in meters; the first two numbers to the right of the decimal point are in centimeters; the third number to the right of that is in millimeters; and the rest of the numbers to the right of the third number are a fraction of a millimeter.

For example, 1.016 reads: one meter, one centimeter, and 6 millimeters. Similarly, 5.55525 is read as 5 meters, 55 centimeters, and 5 1/4 millimeters. The last two numbers, or 25, is 1/4 
of a millimeter.

To find the equivalent of 3 1/8&quot;, for instance, just add the fractional metric equivalent of 1/8&quot; to the metric equivalent of 3 inches. In this case, we have 

1/8&quot; = 0.0032
3&quot; = 0.0762
0.0794 which reads: seven centimeters, nine millimeters, and 4/10, or 2/5, of a millimeter

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter deals with two types of freehand drawing. One pertains to artists' drawings and the other to drawings done by technical men and skilled industrial workers. Artists' drawings are generally ''freehand drawings''; that is, drawings made without the use of drawing instruments or straightedges. Such drawings are made in perspectives; that is, pictorial drawings as seen by the artist's eyes. As his art medium he uses either a lead pencil, charcoal or carbon pencil, black ink, pastel, oil paint, water color, or crayon.

Technical men and industrial workers, on the other hand, make working sketches which are also freehand drawings but are shown in a special type of drawing called orthographic projection. Generally, an object is shown in three orthographic views—top, front, and side views. 

A synonym for freehand drawing is ''sketch''. All technical sketches are freehand drawings, but not all freehand drawings are technical sketches.

'''Pencil Techniques'''

In both freehand drawing and technical sketching, the techniques in drawing or sketching lines are the same. ''Horizontal lines'', for instance, are drawn from left to right. Horizontal lines are lines parallel to the lower edge of the drawing paper. ''Vertical lines'' are sketched from the top downward, and inclined lines are also generally sketched from left to right. ''Short lines'' are drawn with finger movement while ''long lines'' are made with arm movement. Long lines, however, may be drawn in segments with very small spaces or gaps between segments. Those gaps are so small that the lines appear at arm's length as single line. 

''Perpendicular lines'' are lines which make an angle of 90 degrees with each other. Horizontal and vertical lines can be drawn perpendicular to one another. But not all perpendicular lines are horizontal.

''Parallel lines'' are lines which never meet even if they are prolonged or extended to any desired length. Parallel lines may be vertical, horizontal, or inclined.

Lines may be drawn in various thicknesses or weights with a soft pencil. This is done by varying the pressure of the pencil against the drawing paper. It is this feeling of pressure exerted by the fingers on the pencil that must be developed in order to acquire the &quot;feel&quot; of the pencil. These varying kinds of line can also be drawn by using different grades of drawing pencil. 

''Curved lines'', or curves, are regular or irregular. A regular curve is either a circle, an arc(part of the circumference of a circle), or an ellipse. Irregular curves are those which have no definite direction. 

In sketching circles, the radii and the two-stroke method are often used. For an ellipse, the beginners should use the parallelogram method. The other two methods of sketching an ellipse should be attempted only after one has acquired the &quot;feel&quot; of the drawing pencil.

'''Drawing Pencils'''

Drawing pencils are available in various grades of hardness or softness. Hard pencils range from grades H, 2H, . . . , to 9H(the hardest). Soft pencils range from grades B, 2B, . . . , to 6B(the softest). Between H and B pencils are the HB and F. All of these pencils are available in the market. With HB, 2B, and H pencils, the student can easily make variations in the lightness or darkness of his lines even if the pressure of the pencil on the paper is the same for each grade pencil. 

Pencil points may be sharpened into three different shapes: the conical, the chisel, and the elliptical. For sketching purposes, the first two are recommended. 

The conical pointed soft pencil can make different thicknesses of lines by varying the pressure of the pencil against the paper surface. A hard pencil with a similar point can make different thicknesses of lines by varying the shape of its point. A dull point makes a broad line while a fine point makes a fine line. This is why soft pencils are preferred to hard pencils in sketching. The chisel point, on the other hand, makes wide lines depending on the width of the point. It is generally used in shading a penciled outline drawing.

Pencil points are usually sharpened on a sandpaper pad. The wooden part of the pencil is first cut off with a pocket knife or razor or stripping blade, thus exposing the lead about one centimeter long. The pencil point is then shaped on the sandpaper pad by rubbing the point while at the same time turning it.

{{closed|I have decided to close this VfD, I don't think that we will reach consensus on this anytime in the foreseeable future; I am closing it as '''keep and tag/change at your leisure''', as it seems that this is the closest that has been proposed so far to a workable compromise. I highly suggest that the book not be nominated for VfD again unless a good place to transwiki it has been found. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 14:49, 29 July 2007 (UTC)}}

Bizaarely this book was once a featured book but it is very biased, pushes a right-wing religious agenda and is selective with the information it uses to push these views.  Wikibooks should not be a host for books like this. The main problem is with the [[Relationships/Sex]] page.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:34, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Also see [[Wikibooks:Featured_books/Nominations/Archives/Archive_1#Relationships|this]] for the discussion which led to the book's removal as a featured book [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:34, 28 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Far too biased for any decent book, and includes essentially nothing on queer relationships (not surprising given the aforementioned slant). I hate to see so much work go down the tubes, so massive editing could be done to bring it up to snuff - but as it stands? no place on WB for it, so far as I can see. [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 22:29, 28 June 2007 (UTC) (I read some more) Ridiculously sexist in many places. And equates GID with homosexuality. (GRRRRR) However it ''does'' say gays and lesbians make good diplomats or spies, so I won't go off the deep end about things. I don't think WB has room for this book as it stands though - delete. [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 22:37, 28 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' This is at least the third time (i think it might even be the fourth) that this book has been nominated for deletion, and every time i want to delete it, and everybody else doesn't. Let's hope that this time around we can actually evict this garbage. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:13, 28 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''', I'm almost sorry I attempted to help this once, every time I look at it it seems more hopeless. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:41, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - initially, I thought it was just the one page that was awful. However, upon further inspection, I see that most (if not all) of the book is horribly prone to generalisations in line with a specific moral viewpoint. POV, and likely some OR, possibly also some breach of copyright (e.g. references to images &quot;on page [n]&quot; suggest text copying). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:20, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''', The bias is really strong and inappropriate for a reference book. [[User:Jsdratm|Jsdratm]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Jsdratm|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 05:41, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - I understand the huge POV bias in violation of [[WB:NPOV]], and I also strongly agree that the POV bias would require a massive effort to rewrite this content.  But I find it incredibly disturbing that the participants here on Wikibooks are pushing here what appears to be a political bias of any kind, and this seems to be here at the moment a bias against conservative thought.  I'm not necessarily saying that POV edits should be permitted either, but the solution in nearly every instance I've seen with other Wikimedia projects and even here on Wikibooks was to resolve POV problems with cleaning up the content and editing out the POV bias.  Not deleteing the content.&lt;p&gt;We have deleted books in the past because the topic itself (such as Nudism and White Heritage Society) was deemed so controversial that trying to make an NPOV book about that topic was considered impossible.  I'm wondering if the same argument is being made here about a book about relationships?  This boggles my mind here to think about that philosophy.  It also appears to be a really harsh personal attack here against one particular user and their political philosophies.  I have not seen problems with this Wikibook in terms of an edit war where two or more people are attacking each other and engaging in an edit war.... there just hasn't been any attempt at all to try and clean up the NPOV problems with editing at all.  A POV bias will end up in nearly any article/book/news story that is written by just one or a very few individuals, and that is something we need to deal with somehow here on Wikibooks.  Does this mean that we should delete content that has been written by just one or two individuals from all of Wikibooks, as a matter of general policy, when nobody is willing to help clean up NPOV concerns?  BTW, this is hardly the only Wikibook with this problem either. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:36, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
**I think it's wrong to assume that we are deleting this book for any kind of political motivation. Regardless of which side of the political spectrum this book falls onto, it is still heavily biased towards a particular viewpoint. Beyond the politics, there are a number of comments and statements riddled throughout this book that smack of the immaturity of the &quot;How to get a girl&quot; book (a book which was eventually deleted, despite a persistent minority who insisted it was somehow valuable). What we arent talking about here is a book with minor POV flaws, we are talking about serious POV that would require a major rewrite. Combine this with a shortage of people willing to perform such a rewrite, and we are left with an outstanding policy violation. It would be different if somebody were willing to put in the work and effort to fix this book, but considering that this is the third VfD for this book, it seems to me that nobody is going to fix it. There are two options for a POV violation (or a policy violation of any kind): We can try to fix it, or we can delete it. Since the former option has been tried several times and been deemed unfeasable, the latter option is our only reasonable choice now. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:58, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
***This isn't the 3rd VfD proposal for the book, but for the particular module about Sex.  That particular module (mentioned directly here by Xania) may simply need to be deleted.  OK, I can live with that.  But either the Wiki concept works at all and eventually somebody comes and fixes it, or the whole concept of what we are doing should be abandoned.  I don't mind marking up the whole book full of ugly {{tl|NPOV}} markup tags, and perhaps making them even more prominent, larger, and perhaps on each and every page of the book.  Make it very apparent that the Wikibooks community doesn't think this is something that follows the NPOV policies we have talked about, and if you want to help Wikibooks by either rewriting or simply replacing this book with something else would be strongly encouraged.  I'm suggesting that this is a dangerous precedent to delete a book just because several individuals here don't agree with the content.  I have seen some Wikibooks turn out much better on the rewrite when a full rewrite was proposed, however.  I would also strongly support that the printed version of this book (PDF form), if there are some grave POV concerns, be deleted.  Such a POV biased book should not be treated as a featured book or given even the attention a printed version often brings.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:22, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
****The other nominations for deletion were started because of the problems with the sex page, but in every other nomination it was suggested with all seriousness (and considered appropriately) that the rest of the book be deleted as well. And each time the issue comes up, people say &quot;but somebody will eventually come by and fix this, they just must&quot;. At the same time, however, the people who are voting &quot;keep&quot; are not chomping at the bit to actually do the work necessary to fix it. I mean it's all good to say &quot;This book might be able to be fixed&quot;, it's another thing entirely to say &quot;I'm going to fix this myself, right now, and I'll report back when I am done with the results&quot;. We don't have a surplus of editors around here, and the editors that we do have are busy working on ''worthwhile projects'', and not trying to salvage every piece of garbage that gets by the gates. This book is a policy violation, history has demonstrated that ''it will not be fixed'', and we need to consider that when we make our deletion decisions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[...User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:14, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I have to agree with Rob here with a caveat.  If there are copyvios as Webaware suggests (and there is strong evidence that there is), those parts should be deleted post-haste.  I don't know where the &quot;see page n&quot; part is in this book, but if I did, I'd go there, paste some unique-ish looking text into Google and see what turns up.  I have found a lot of copyvios this way.  Copyvios aside, I think the rest of the book should be riddled with NPOV tags and then we should give the book time (a ''lot'' of time) for someone to adopt it and neutralize the POVs.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 14:03, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Far too much will need to be re-written if it were to adhere to [[WB:NPOV]]. [[User:DaGizza|DaGizza]] 14:08, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I've made my arguments many times before. This really needs to go because it's had enough time to decompose now and with no new development to fix its massive flaws. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:37, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I share Rob opinion also with Jomegat exception (copyvios must be dealt with).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:11, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Terrible! The more I look at it, the worse it gets. To make it more accurate and NPOV would require a near-total rewrite. Also, it does look like a copyvio---see the first sentence in [[Relationships/How_Our_Ancestors_Lived]]: &quot;If human existence were as long as two copies of this book, for all but the last page of the second book—10,000 years—humans lived in small bands of hunter-gatherers.&quot; Obviously, a wikibook doesn't have a static length, so it looks like it was copied. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 04:24, 30 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I can't help but think that if the POV of the article was liberal or libertine, POV would not be an issue. This book has been excerpted in at least one place on the web, but I did not find any direct evidence of it being a copyright violation. The book is fairly extensively sourced for a Wikibook, and statements that it has not been improved since it was last listed for deletion are not true. The editing history demonstrates otherwise. It was last listed for deletion 3 months ago (not a year) and the VFD was initiated by the same individual that initiated it this time. I don't think it's good precedent to delete this book. Books should not be deleted for being US centric any more than they should be deleted for being UK centric, or Australia centric. POV should be fixed or specific POV sections removed. I disagree that the whole book would have to be completely rewritten to remove POV. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:48, 30 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - regarding the possible copyvio, it was largely a feeling I got whilst reading some of this book. [[Relationships/Monogamy and Polygamy#Women's Power]] was where I saw &quot;see photo page 193&quot;. I Googled, but drew a blank. It may be simply referring to one of the footnoted citations, or it may be a text copy from a printed book (i.e. no on-line copy). Regarding Xixtas' comment above about the book being US-centric, that surprises me - I simply thought it sounded very POV, not realising that it was mainstream US POV. That aside, the &quot;facts&quot; in the book are heavy on the pseudo-science; I suspect there are factual errors, most likely because the POV of the authors demand it. If this book is not deleted, then there should be a concerted effort to tag all suspect &quot;facts&quot; for checking. I'm a computer geek, so I can't speak to the veracity of the book's citations, but I get the impression that the citations have largely been used to support a POV rather than present useful facts. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:09, 30 June 2007 (UTC)
*:I believe that the POV issues and the fact that the book is US centric are two separate things. Facts are facts no matter where you live. The reason for deletion specifically lists that the book is US centric. I do not think this is a valid reason to delete a wikibook. One of the great things about Wikibooks is that there can be two different books intended for two different audiences. (One relationships book for Americans, another for Australians... why not?) Not everything has to be written for a world-wide audience like at Wikipedia. That is very disturbing that the book references a photo that doesn't exist in the text, but it is not proof of copyvio. It is simply proof that the book was originally written in a different format. If it was the same author who first wrote (see photo page 193) that uploaded this content to Wikibooks, then there is no copyvio. The writing is so unpolished that I can't imagine that this book has actually been published so I actually think the chance of it being a copyvio is slim. My main point is that not enough time has passed since the book last was up for RfD and there is nothing here that was not already discussed there. There have been contributions to the book since that discussion and the book is improving bit by bit. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:36, 30 June 2007 (UTC)
*::Forgive me if I missed something, Xixtas, but I only see mention of the book being US-centric in your posts. I agree that there is nothing wrong with having a country-specific textbook on Wikibooks, but I can't see where anyone but you has claimed that this is the perceived problem with ''Relationships''. 
*::Regarding facts, you are correct - facts are facts. However, this book presents things as facts, but they sound more like POV dressed up as facts and supported by carefully selected citations. I question how much of the book is like that.

*'''Keep''' - Regarding copyright, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Relationships/About_This_Book explains that I wrote &quot;Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships.&quot; I own the copyright to the book I wrote, and I uploaded the book to Wikibooks with my permission.

Regarding the &quot;Sex&quot; chapter, looking at the edits history, I uploaded the chapter on October 2, 2006 (nine months ago). I count about 40 edits since then, by about 15 individuals, of whom Xania, Az1568, Archolman, Herbythyme, Mattb112885, and Remi0o stand out. 95% of what I wrote is gone, and 95% of what's in the &quot;Sex&quot; chapter now wasn't written by me. If you vote to delete the &quot;Sex&quot; chapter I won't be personally offended, as I didn't write what's in that chapter now. If that's your vote, then you should also propose a policy that Wikibooks can never have anything about sex. The &quot;Sex&quot; chapter was produced by 15 people over nine months. If the result isn't acceptable, then maybe Wikibooks should stick to books about C++ programming and not get into sticky subjects like sex.

(It's also ironic that the edits page suggests Xania is a primary author of the current &quot;Sex&quot; module, yet he/she wants to delete it.)

If you want my opinion about the &quot;Sex&quot; chapter, it's awful. It looks like it was written by a school board committee. The original chapter I wrote had good stuff in it, such as a recommendation to the only book with excellent information about birth control (&quot;Our Bodies, Our Selves&quot;); a study finding that when parents take a sex education class their children have less sexual activity (due to better communication about sex between parents and children); pages about how alcohol affects consent issues; Nevada's three rules for brothels that kept HIV infection at zero levels, as compared to Nevada's streetwalkers (who don't have rules enforced on them) being 6-10% HIV positive; and that nibbling your partner's sternocleidonastoid muscle can be overwhelmingly pleasurable for your partner (don't worry, the SCM goes between your ear and your collarbone).

I don't have time today to see how the rest of the book has changed since I uploaded it nine months ago. I'll try to look at it in the next week or so.

The rest of my comments are about the book I wrote, which may or may not be the same as the current &quot;Relationships&quot; Wikibook.

In the reviews of &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; on Amazon each reader appears to have read a different book. I seem to have written a book that readers either love or hate, because they see in it support for their views about relationships, or attacks on their views about relationships. Yet what readers say is best or worst about the book often isn't in the book! For example, one Amazon reader complained that the book said that &quot;women must wear short skirts with a slit.&quot; That's not in the book I wrote!

I see comments here saying that the book is &quot;biased&quot; or lacks a NPOV, yet few people articulate what the bias is. One person commented that the book promotes a &quot;right-wing religious agenda.&quot; I've received complaints from other individuals that the book promoted liberal views such as homosexuality, pre-marital sex, and condom use! I'm happy to see that I've pissed off both right-wing and left-wing extremists. I suspect that half the commenters think it's liberal and half think it's conservative, half think it's pro-homosexual and half think it's anti-homosexual, half think it's pro-polygeny and half think it's anti-polygeny, etc. If so, then the book has a NPOV even though each individual thinks that it doesn't. Relationships in general and sex in particular is an emotionally charged area. It's impossible to write a relationships book that doesn't offend someone.

That the book is biased towards understanding women is true. A bisexual woman thanked me for writing the book, saying that it helped her understand women. She said that men are easy to understand, but dating women had always baffled her. Another bisexual woman said the same thing later. The first chapter of the book explains this (women are hardwired to seek two, opposite goals: the best genetic donor, i.e., men who are desired by many other women; and a single partner who'll make a long-term commitment, which often means that no other woman wants the guy).

The book has almost 400 references, largely to scientific textbooks and scientific journals. The book presents the scientific facts about male-female relationships. These facts are often little-known, unpopular, and controversial. That's why I wrote the book. --[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]]

:Though I am not listed in your list of authors, the state of the /sex module is primarily my doing. I basically rewrote the whole thing in an effort to keep this book from being deleted and will happily admit that it is not my best work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Behaviorism is a perspective on learning that focuses on changes in individuals’ observable behaviors—changes in what people say or do. At some point we all use this perspective, whether we call it “behaviorism” or something else. The first time that I drove a car, for example, I was concerned primarily with whether I could actually do the driving, not with whether I could describe or explain how to drive. And for another example: when I reached the point in life where I began cooking meals for myself, I was more focused on whether I could actually produce edible food in a kitchen than with whether I could explain my recipes and cooking procedures to others. And still another example—one often relevant to new teachers: when I began my first year of teaching, I was more focused on doing the job of teaching—on day-to-day survival—than on pausing to reflect on what I was doing.

Note that in all of these examples, focusing attention on behavior instead of on “thoughts” may have been desirable at that moment, but not necessarily desirable indefinitely or all of the time. Even as a beginner, there are times when it is more important to be able to describe how to drive or to cook than to actually do these things. And there definitely are many times when reflecting on and thinking about teaching can improve teaching itself. (As a teacher-friend once said to me, “Don’t just do something; stand there!”) But neither is focusing on behavior necessarily less desirable than focusing on students’ “inner” changes, such as gains in their knowledge or their personal attitudes. If you are teaching, you will need to attend to all forms of learning in students, whether inner or outward.

In classrooms, behaviorism is most useful for identifying relationships between specific actions by a student and the immediate precursors and consequences of the actions. It is less useful for understanding changes in students’ thinking; for this purpose we need a more cognitive (or thinking-oriented) theory, like the ones described later in this chapter. This fact is not really a criticism of behaviorism as a perspective, but just a clarification of its particular strength or source of usefulness, which is to highlight observable relationships among actions, precursors and consequences. Behaviorists use particular terms (or “lingo,” some might say) for these relationships. They also rely primarily on two basic images or models of behavioral learning, called ''respondent (or “classical”) conditioning'' and ''operant conditioning.'' The names are derived partly from the major learning mechanisms highlighted by each type, which I describe next.

===Respondent Conditioning: Learning New Associations with Prior Behaviors===

As originally conceived, '''respondent conditioning''' (sometimes also called ''classical conditioning'') begins with the involuntary responses to particular sights, sounds, or other sensations (Lavond &amp; Steinmetz, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Lavond, D. &amp; Steinmetz, J. (2003). ''Handbook of classical conditioning.'' Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;. When I receive an injection from a nurse or doctor, for example, I cringe, tighten my muscles, and even perspire a bit. Whenever a contented, happy baby looks at me, on the other hand, I invariably smile in response. I cannot help myself in either case; both of the responses are automatic. In humans as well as other animals, there is a repertoire or variety of such specific, involuntary behaviors. At the sound of a sudden loud noise, for example, most of us show a “startle” response—we drop what we are doing (sometimes literally!), our heart rate shoots up temporarily, and we look for the source of the sound. Cats, dogs, and many other animals (even fish in an aquarium) show similar or equivalent responses.

Involuntary stimuli and responses were first studied systematically early in the twentieth century by the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov (1927)&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I. (1927). ''Conditioned reflexes.'' London, UK: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Pavlov’s most well-known work did not involve humans, but dogs, and specifically their involuntary tendency to salivate when eating. He attached a small tube to the side of dogs’ mouths that allowed him to measure how much the dogs salivated when fed. But he soon noticed a “problem” with the procedure: as the dogs gained experience with the experiment, they often salivated ''before'' they began eating. In fact the most experienced dogs sometimes began salivating before they even saw any food, simply when Pavlov himself entered the room! The sight of the experimenter, which had originally been a neutral experience for the dogs, became associated with the dogs’ original salivation response. Eventually, in fact, the dogs would salivate at the sight of Pavlov even if he did not feed them.

This ''change'' in the dogs’ involuntary response, and especially its growing independence from the food as stimulus, eventually became the focus of Pavlov’s research. Psychologists named the process respondent conditioning because it describes changes in responses to stimuli (though some have also called it “classical conditioning” because it was historically the first form of behavioral learning to be studied systematically). Respondent conditioning has several elements, each with a special name. To understand these, look at [[/Figure 1/]], and imagine a dog (such as my own, named Ginger) prior to any conditioning. At the beginning Ginger salivates (an '''unconditioned response (UR)''') only when she actually tastes her dinner (an '''unconditioned stimulus (US)''').  As time goes by, however, a neutral stimulus—such as the sound of opening a bag containing fresh dog food—is continually paired with the eating/tasting experience. Eventually the neutral stimulus becomes able to elicit salivation even before any dog food is offered to Ginger, or even if the bag of food is empty! At this point the neutral stimulus is called a '''conditioned stimulus (UCS)''' and the original response is renamed as a '''conditioned response (CR)'''. Now, after conditioning, Ginger salivates merely at the sound of opening any large bag, regardless of its contents. (I might add that Ginger also engages in other conditioned responses, such as looking hopeful and following me around the house at dinner time.)

===Respondent Conditioning and Students===
“OK,” you may be thinking, “Respondent conditioning may happen to animals. But does anything like it happen in classrooms?” It might seem like not much would, since teaching is usually about influencing students’ conscious words and thoughts, and not their involuntary behaviors. But remember that schooling is not just about encouraging thinking and talking. Teachers, like parents and the public, also seek positive changes in students’ attitudes and feelings—attitudes like a love for learning, for example, and feelings like self-confidence. It turns out that respondent conditioning describes these kinds of changes relatively well.

Consider, for example, a child who responds happily whenever meeting a new person who is warm and friendly, but who also responds cautiously or at least neutrally in any new situation. Suppose further that the “new, friendly person” in question is you, his teacher. Initially the child’s response to you is like an unconditioned stimulus: you smile (the unconditioned stimulus) and in response he perks up, breathes easier, and smiles (the unconditioned response). This exchange is not the whole story, however, but merely the setting for an important bit of behavior change: suppose you smile at him while standing in your classroom, a “new situation” and therefore one to which he normally responds cautiously. Now respondent learning can occur. The initially neutral stimulus (your classroom) becomes associated repeatedly with the original unconditioned stimulus (your smile) and the child’s unconditioned response (his smile). Eventually, if all goes well, the classroom becomes a conditioned stimulus in its own right: it can elicit the child’s smiles and other “happy behaviors” even without your immediate presence or stimulus. [[/Figure 2a/]] diagrams the situation graphically. When the change in behavior happens, you might say that the child has “learned” to like being in your classroom. Truly a pleasing outcome for both of you!

But less positive or desirable examples of respondent conditioning also can happen. Consider a modification of the example that I just gave. Suppose the child that I just mentioned did not have the good fortune of being placed in your classroom. Instead he found himself with a less likeable teacher, whom we could simply call Mr. Horrible. Instead of smiling a lot and eliciting the child’s unconditioned “happy response,” Mr. Horrible often frowns and scowls at the child. In this case, therefore, the child’s initial unconditioned response is negative: whenever Mr. Horrible directs a frown or scowl at the child, the child automatically cringes a little, his eyes widen in fear, and his heart beat races. If the child sees Mr. Horrible doing most of his frowning and scowling in the classroom, eventually the classroom itself will acquire power as a negative conditioned stimulus. Eventually, that is, the child will not need Mr. Horrible to be present in order to feel apprehensive; simply being in the classroom will be enough. Figure 2b diagrams this unfortunate situation. Obviously it is an outcome to be avoided, and in fact does not usually happen in such an extreme way. But hopefully it makes the point: any stimulus that is initially neutral, but that gets associated with an unconditioned stimulus and response, can eventually acquire the ability to elicit the response by itself. Anything—whether it is desirable or not.

The changes described in these two examples are important because they affect students’ attitude about school, and therefore also their motivation to learn. In the positive case, the child becomes more inclined to please the teacher and to attend to what he or she has to offer; in the negative case, the opposite occurs. Note that even though the changes are elicited by events external to the child, the child’s newly learned attitude is best thought of as “inside” or belonging to the child—or ''intrinsic.'' The new responses suggest that the child has acquired one type of '''intrinsic motivation,''' meaning a desire or tendency to direct attention and energy in a particular way that originates from the child himself or herself. It is sometimes contrasted '''extrinsic motivation,''' which is a tendency to direct attention and energy that originates from ''outside'' of the child. As we will see, classical conditioning is one way to influence students’ intrinsic motivation, but not the only way to develop it. Many strategies for influencing students’ motivations focus less on their behavior, and more on their thoughts and beliefs about themselves and about what they are learning. I describe these in detail in [[.././Chapter 6/]] (the chapter called “Student Motivation”). First, though, let us look at three other features of classical conditioning that complicate the picture a bit, but also render conditioning a more accurate or appropriate description of students’ learning.

===Three Key Ideas about Respondent Conditioning===

====Extinction====
This term does not refer to the fate of dinosaurs, but to the ''disappearance'' of a link between the conditioned stimulus and the conditioned response. Imagine a third variation on the conditioning “story” described above. Suppose, as I suggested above, that the child begins by associating your happy behaviors—your smiles—to his being present in the classroom, so that the classroom itself becomes enough to elicit his own smiles. But now suppose there is a sad turn of events: you become sick and must therefore leave the classroom in the middle of the school year. A substitute is called in who is not Mr. Horrible, but simply someone who is not very expressive, someone we can call Ms. Neutral. At first the child continues to feel good (that is, to smile) whenever present in the classroom. But because the link between the classroom and your particular smiles is no longer repeated or associated, the child’s response gradually ''extinguishes,'' or fades until it has disappeared entirely. In a sense the child’s initial learning is “unlearned.”

Extinction can also happen with negative examples of classical conditioning. If Mr. Horrible leaves mid-year (perhaps because no one could stand working with him any longer!), then the child’s negative responses (cringing, eyes widening, heart beat racing, and so on) will also extinguish eventually. Note, though, that whether the conditioned stimulus is positive or negative, extinction does not happen suddenly or immediately, but unfolds over time. This fact can sometimes obscure the process if you are a busy teacher attending to many students.

====Generalization====
When Pavlov studied conditioning in dogs, he noticed that the original conditioned stimulus was not the only neutral stimulus that elicited the conditioned response. If he paired a particular bell with the sight of food, for example, so that the bell became a conditioned stimulus for salivation, then it turned out that other bells, perhaps with a different pitch or type or sound, also acquired some ability to trigger salivation—though not as much as the original bell. Psychologists call this process '''generalization,''' or the tendency for similar stimuli to elicit a conditioned response. The child being conditioned to your smile, for example, might learn to associate your smile not only with being present in your own classroom, but also to being present in other, similar classrooms. His conditioned smiles may be strongest where he learned them initially (that is, in your own room), but nonetheless visible to a significant extent in other teachers’ classrooms. To the extent that this happens, he has generalized his learning. It is of course good news; it means that we can say that the child is beginning to “learn to like school” in general, and not just your particular room. Unfortunately, the opposite can also happen: if a child learns negative associations from Mr. Horrible, the child’s fear, caution, and stress might generalize to other classrooms as well. The lesson for teachers is therefore clear: we have a responsibility, wherever possible, to make classrooms pleasant places to be.

====Discrimination====
Generalization among similar stimuli can be reduced if only one of the similar stimuli is associated consistently with the unconditioned response, while the others are not. When this happens, psychologists say that discrimination learning has occurred, meaning that the individual has learned to distinguish or respond differently to one stimulus than to another. From an educational point of view, discrimination learning can be either desirable or not, depending on the particulars of the situation. Imagine again (for the fourth time!) the child who learns to associate your classroom with your smiles, so that he eventually produces smiles of his own whenever present in your room. But now imagine yet another variation on his story: the child is old enough to attend middle school, and therefore has several teachers across the day. You—with your smiles—are one, but so are Mr. Horrible and Ms. Neutral. At first the child may generalize his classically conditioned smiles to the other teachers’ classrooms. But the other teachers do not smile like you do, and this fact causes the child’s smiling to extinguish somewhat in their rooms. Meanwhile, you keep smiling in your room. Eventually the child is smiling only in your room and not in the other rooms. When this happens, we say that discrimination has occurred, meaning that the conditioned associations happen only to a single version of the unconditioned stimuli—in this case, only to your smiles, and not to the (rather rare) occurrences of smiles in the other classrooms. Judging by his behavior, the child is making a distinction between your room and others’.

In one sense the discrimination in this story is unfortunate in that it prevents the child from acquiring a liking for school that is generalized. But notice that an opposing, more desirable process is happening at the same time: the child is also prevented from acquiring a generalized dislike of school. The fear producing stimuli from Mr. Horrible, in particular, become discriminated from the happiness-producing smiles from you, so the child’s learns to confine his fearful responses to that particular classroom, and does not generalize them to other “innocent” classrooms, including your own. This is still not an ideal situation for the student, but maybe it is more desirable than disliking school altogether.

===Operant Conditioning: New Behaviors Because of New Consequences===
Instead of focusing on associations between stimuli and responses, operant conditioning focuses on how the effects of consequences on behaviors. The operant model of learning begins with the idea that certain consequences tend to make certain behaviors happen more frequently. If I compliment a student for a good comment during a discussion, there is more chance that I will hear comments from the student more often in the future (and hopefully they will also be good ones!). If a student tells a joke to several classmates and they laugh at it, then the student is more likely to tell additional jokes in the future. And so on.

As with respondent conditioning, the original research about this model of learning was not done with people, but with animals. One of the pioneers in the field was a Harvard professor named B. F. Skinner, who published numerous books and articles about the details of the process and who pointed out many parallels between operant conditioning in animals and operant conditioning in humans (1938, 1948, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1938). ''The behavior of organisms.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1948). ''Walden Two.'' New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The selection of behavior: The operant behaviorism of b. F. Skinner.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Skinner observed the behavior of rather tame laboratory rats (not the unpleasant kind that sometimes live in garbage dumps). He or his assistants would put them in a cage that contained little except a lever and a small tray just big enough to hold a small amount of food. (Figure 3 shows the basic set-up, which is sometimes nicknamed a “Skinner box.”) At first the rat would sniff and “putter around” the cage at random, but sooner or later it would happen upon the lever and eventually happen to press it. Presto! The lever released a small pellet of food, which the rat would promptly eat. Gradually the rat would spend more time near the lever and press the lever more frequently, getting food more frequently. Eventually it would spend most of its time at the lever and eating its fill of food. The rat had “discovered” that the consequence of pressing the lever was to receive food. Skinner called the changes in the rat’s behavior an example of '''operant conditioning,''' and gave special names to the different parts of the process. He called the food pellets the '''reinforcement''' and the lever-pressing the '''operant'''(because it “operated” on the rat’s environment).

Skinner and other behavioral psychologists experimented with using various reinforcers and operants. They also experimented with various patterns of reinforcement (or '''schedules of reinforcement'''), as well as with various cues or signals to the animal about when reinforcement was available. It turned out that all of these factors—the operant, the reinforcement, the schedule, and the cues—affected how easily and thoroughly operant conditioning occurred. For example, reinforcement was more effective if it came immediately after the crucial operant behavior, rather than being delayed, and reinforcements that happened intermittently (only part of the time) caused learning to take longer, but also caused it to last longer.

====Operant Conditioning and Students’ Learning====
As with respondent conditioning, it is important to ask whether operant conditioning also describes learning in human beings, and especially in students in classrooms. On this point the answer seems to be clearly “yes.” There are countless classroom examples of consequences affecting students’ behavior in ways that resemble operant conditioning, although the process certainly does not account for all forms of student learning (Alberto &amp; Troutman, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Alberto, P. &amp; Troutman, A. (2005). ''Applied behavior alaysis for teachers, 7th edition.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;. Consider the following examples. In most of them the operant behavior tends to become more frequent on repeated occasions:
* A seventh-grade boy makes a silly face (the operant) at the girl sitting next to him. Classmates sitting around them giggle in response (the reinforcement).
* A kindergarten child raises her hand in response to the teacher’s question about a story (the operant). The teacher calls on her and she makes her comment (the reinforcement).
* Another kindergarten child blurts out her comment without being called on (the operant). The teacher frowns ignores this behavior, but before the teacher calls on a different student, classmates are listening attentively (the  reinforcement) to the student even though he did not raise his hand as he should have.
* A twelfth-grade student—a member of the track team—runs one mile during practice (the operant). He notes the time it takes him as well as his increase in speed since joining the team (the reinforcement).
* A child who is usually very restless sits for five minutes doing an assignment (the operant). The teaching assistant compliments him for working hard (the reinforcement).
* A sixth-grader takes home a book from the classroom library to read overnight (the operant). When she returns the book the next morning, her teacher puts a gold star by her name on a chart posted in the room (the reinforcement).

Hopefully these examples are enough to make four points about operant conditioning. First, the process is ''widespread'' in classrooms—probably more widespread than respondent conditioning. This fact makes sense, given the nature of public education: to a large extent, teaching is about making certain consequences for students (like praise or marks) depend on students’ engaging in certain activities (like reading certain material or doing assignments). Second, learning by operant conditioning is not confined to any particular grade, subject area, or style of teaching, but by nature happens in ''nearly every imaginable classroom.'' Third, teachers are not the only persons controlling reinforcements. Sometimes they are controlled by the activity itself (as in the track team example), or by classmates (as in the “giggling” example). A result of all of the above points is a fourth: that multiple examples of operant conditioning often happen at the same time. [[/The Case Study/]] for this chapter (The Decline and Fall of Jane Gladstone) suggests how this happened to someone completing student teaching.

Because operant conditioning happens so widely, its effects on motivation are a bit more complex than the effects of respondent conditioning. As in respondent conditioning, operant conditioning can encourage intrinsic motivation to the extent that the reinforcement for an activity can sometimes be the activity itself. When a student reads a book for the sheer enjoyment of reading, for example, he is reinforced by the reading itself; then we often say that his reading is “intrinsically motivated.” More often, however, operant conditioning stimulates both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation at the same time. The combining of both is noticeable in the examples that I listed above. In each example, it is reasonable to assume that the student felt intrinsically motivated to some partial extent, even when reward came from outside the student as well. This was because part of what reinforced their behavior was the behavior itself—whether it was making faces, running a mile, or contributing to a discussion. At the same time, though, note that each student probably was also extrinsically motivated, meaning that another part of the reinforcement came from consequences or experiences not inherently part of the activity or behavior itself. The boy who made a face was reinforced not only by the pleasure of making a face, for example, but also by the giggles of classmates. The track student was reinforced not only by the pleasure of running itself, but also by knowledge of his improved times and speeds. Even the usually restless child sitting still for five minutes may have been reinforced partly by this brief experience of unusually focused activity, even if he was also reinforced by the teacher aide’s compliment. Note that the extrinsic part of the reinforcement may sometimes be more easily observed or noticed than the intrinsic part, which by definition may sometimes only be experienced within the individual and not also displayed outwardly. This latter fact may contribute to an impression that sometimes occurs, that operant conditioning is really just “bribery in disguise”—that only the external reinforcements operate on students’ behavior. It is true that external reinforcement may sometimes alter the nature or strength of internal (or intrinsic) reinforcement, but this is not the same as saying that it destroys or replaces intrinsic reinforcement. But more about this issue later! (See especially [[../Chapter 6: Student Motivation/]].)

===Comparing Operant Conditioning and Respondent Conditioning===
Operant conditioning is made more complicated, but also more realistic, by many of the same concepts as used in respondent conditioning. In most cases, however, the additional concepts have slightly different meanings in each model of learning. Since this circumstance can make the terms confusing, let me explain the differences for three major concepts used in both models—extinction, generalization, and discrimination. Then I will comment on two additional concepts—schedules of reinforcement and cues—that are sometimes also used in talking about both forms of conditioning, but that are important primarily for understanding operant conditioning. The explanations and comments are also summarized in [[/Table 2/]].

In both respondent and operant conditioning, ''extinction'' refers to the disappearance of “something.” In operant conditioning, what disappears is the operant behavior because of a lack of reinforcement. A student who stops receiving gold stars or compliments for prolific reading of library books, for example, may extinguish (i.e. decrease or stop) book-reading behavior. In respondent conditioning, on the other hand, what disappears is association between the conditioned stimulus (the CS) and the conditioned response (CR). If you stop smiling at a student, then the student may extinguish her association between you and her pleasurable response to your smile, or between your classroom and the student’s pleasurable response to your smile.

In both forms of conditioning, ''generalization'' means that something “extra” gets conditioned if it is somehow similar to “something.” In operant conditioning, the extra conditioning is to behaviors similar to the original operant. If getting gold stars results in my reading more library books, then I may generalize this behavior to other similar activities, such as reading the newspaper, even if the activity is not reinforced directly. In respondent conditioning, however, the extra conditioning refers to stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus. If I am a student and I respond happily to my teacher’s smiles, then I may find myself responding happily to other people (like my other teachers) to some extent, even if they do not smile at me. Generalization is a lot like the concept of transfer that I discussed early in this chapter, in that it is about extending prior learning to new situations or contexts. From the perspective of operant conditioning, though, what is being extended (or “transferred” or generalized) is a behavior, not knowledge or skill.

In both forms of conditioning, ''discrimination'' means learning not to generalize. In operant conditioning, though, what is not being overgeneralized is the operant behavior. If I am a student who is being complimented (reinforced) for contributing to discussions, I must also learn to discriminate when to make verbal contributions from when not to make verbal contributions—such as when classmates or the teacher are busy with other tasks. In respondent conditioning, what are not being overgeneralized are the conditioned stimuli that elicit the conditioned response. If I, as a student, learn to associate the mere sight of a smiling teacher with my own happy, contented behavior, then I also have to learn not to associate this same happy response with similar, but slightly different sights, such as a teacher looking annoyed.

In both forms of conditioning, the ''schedule of reinforcement'' refers to the pattern or frequency by which “something” is paired with “something else.” In operant conditioning, what is being paired is the pattern by which reinforcement is linked with the operant. If a teacher praises me for my work, does she do it every time, or only sometimes? Frequently or only once in awhile? In respondent conditioning, however, the schedule in question is the pattern by which the conditioned stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus. If I am student with Mr. Horrible as my teacher, does he scowl every time he is in the classroom, or only sometimes? Frequently or rarely?

Behavioral psychologists have studied schedules of reinforcement extensively (for example, Ferster, et al., 1997; Mazur, 2005&lt;ref&gt;Ferster, C., Skiner, B.F., Cheney, C., Morese, W., &amp; Dews, D. ''Schedules of reinforcement.'' New York: Copley Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, J. (2005). ''Learning and behavior, 6th edition.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;), and found a number of interesting effects of different schedules. For teachers, however, the most important finding may be this: partial or intermittent schedules of reinforcement generally cause learning to take longer, but also cause extinction of learning to take longer. This dual principle is important for teachers because so much of the reinforcement we give is partial or intermittent. Typically, if I am teaching, I can compliment a student a lot of the time, for example, but there will inevitably be occasions when I cannot do so because I am busy elsewhere in the classroom.

For teachers concerned both about motivating students and about minimizing inappropriate behaviors, this is both good news and bad. The good news is that the benefits of my praising students’ constructive behavior will be more lasting, because they will not extinguish their constructive behaviors immediately if I fail to support them every single time they happen. The bad news is that students’ negative behaviors may take longer to extinguish as well, because those too may have developed through partial reinforcement. A student who clowns around inappropriately in class, for example, may not be “supported” by classmates’ laughter every time it happens, but only some of the time. Once the inappropriate behavior is learned, though, it will take somewhat longer to disappear even if everyone—both teacher and classmates—make a concerted effort to ignore (or extinguish) it.

Finally, behavioral psychologists have studied the effects of '''cues.''' In operant conditioning, a cue is a stimulus that happens just prior to the operant behavior and that signals that performing the behavior may lead to reinforcement. Its effect is much like discrimination learning in respondent conditioning, except that what is “discriminated” in this case is not a conditioned behavior that is reflex-like, but a voluntary action, the operant. In the original conditioning experiments, Skinner’s rats were sometimes cued by the presence or absence of a small electric light in their cage. Reinforcement was associated with pressing a lever when, and only when, the light was on. In classrooms, cues are sometimes provided by the teacher or simply by the established routines of the class. Calling on a student to speak, for example, can be a cue that if the student does say something at that moment, then he or she may be reinforced with praise or acknowledgement. But if that cue does not occur—if the student is not called on—speaking may not be rewarded. In more everyday, non-behaviorist terms, the cue allows the student to learn when it is acceptable to speak, and when it is not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I still don't have the knack for using the shortcut syntax for page links within a wikibook there are a few problems for this chapter--subsections are not universally and mutually accessible. I've got to go back and check them all, whilst paying close attention to the syntax. Seems like a &quot;flat&quot; structure is easier to deal with overall for a large online document--I can see why people are favoring it compared to a deep structure.

First, though, I want to get the rest of the content posted for Chapter 2. Then I will fiddle with the links again.

===p.s.===
OK, content has now been posted (mostly), though not yet the &quot;end matter.&quot; The Constructivism and Behaviorism sections are inconsistent, though--construc. is posted on main intro page, but behaviorism is linked to a separate page. A parallel structure would be better. [[User:Klseifert|Klseifert]] 16:19, 9 August 2007 (UTC)

===Simple end matter has been posted===
Now what is missing is:
* Tables and figures--for these I will have to learn the syntax. It seems potentially difficult, but hopefully OK if I take my time.
* Appropriate links to wikipedia &quot;definitional&quot; articles. I know I'm not supposed to use many of these, but I think there are a few that should be added to this chapter.
* Check for full, mutual linkages among pages and parts.
* Question: is there no way in a wiki to do the equivalent of an &quot;anchored link&quot; that I use a lot in Dreamweaver?

      <text xml:space="preserve">All basic writing is now posted for all chapters of this book. However I still see these problems:
* Initial sections of some chapters are too long and should therefore be split up, shortened, and/or moved into separate pages of their own. The intro to each chapter should be kept very short so that the Table of Contents will display easily &quot;above the fold&quot; (so to speak)--i.e. on one average computer screen.
* The initial anecdotes and stories may need to be deleted or placed elsewhere. I'm not sure they belong in a Wikibook. Maybe move them to Wikisource or Wikiuniversity? Since they are a bit more literary in style, and therefore perhaps cannot be edited in the same way as more expository material without doing violence to their intent? I'm not sure about this.
* Various links of all sorts need to be added. They include tables and figures, but also links between chapters and sections, and perhaps also with Wikipedia and other external sources.

Readers of the book may, of course, see additional or different problems. Any comments or concerns are therefore welcome. You can put them either here or on [[User_talk:Klseifert|my talk page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Behaviorist models of learning may be helpful in understanding and influencing what students do, but teachers usually also want to know what students are thinking, and want to enrich what they are thinking. For this aspect of teaching, some of the best help comes from '''constructivism,''' which is a perspective on learning focused on how students actively create (or “construct”) knowledge out of experiences. Constructivist models of learning differ among themselves, and one of the most important differences is about how much the model focuses on learners as independent individuals, compared to the social links between an individual and people who may be more expert and who can help the individual to learn (Fosnot, 2005; Rockmore, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Fostnot, C. (Ed.). (2005). ''Constructivism: Theory, perspectives, and practice, 2nd edition.'' New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rockmore, T. (2005). ''On constructivist epistemology.'' Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;. For convenience (and because others sometimes use these same terms) I will call these '''psychological constructivism''' and '''social constructivism,''' even though both versions are in a sense explanations about thinking in individuals. 

===Psychological Constructivism: The Independent Investigator===
The main idea of psychological constructivism is that a person learns by mentally organizing and reorganizing new information or experiences. The organization happens partly by relating new experiences to prior knowledge that is already meaningful and well understood. Stated in this general form, individual constructivism is sometimes associated with a well-known educational philosopher of the early twentieth century, '''John Dewey''' (1938/1998)&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1938/1998). ''How we think.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although Dewey himself did not use the term constructivism in most of his writing, his point of view amounted to a type of constructivism, and he discussed in detail its implications for educators. He argued, for example, that if students indeed learn primarily by building their own knowledge, then teachers should adjust the curriculum to fit students’ prior knowledge and interests as fully as possible. He also argued that a curriculum could only be justified if it related as fully as possible to the activities and responsibilities that students will probably have later, after leaving school. To many educators these days, his ideas may seem merely like good common sense, but they were indeed innovative and progressive at the beginning of the twentieth century.

A more recent example of psychological constructivism is the cognitive theory of '''Jean Piaget'''' (Piaget, 2001; Gruber &amp; Voneche, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (2001). ''The psychology of intelligence.'' London, UK: routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, H. &amp; Voneche, J. (Eds.) (1995). ''The essential Piaget.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. Piaget described learning as interplay between two mental activities that he called assimilation and accommodation. ''Assimilation'' is the interpretation of new information in terms of pre-existing concepts, information or ideas. A preschool child who already understands the concept of bird, for example, might initially label any flying object with this term—even butterflies or mosquitoes. Assimilation is therefore a lot like the idea of generalization in operant conditioning, as well as the idea of transfer that I described at the beginning of this chapter as an enduring concern of teachers. In Piaget’s viewpoint, though, what is being transferred to a new setting is not simply a behavior, as in operant conditioning, but a mental representation for an object or experience.

Assimilation operates jointly with ''accommodation,'' which is the revision or modification of pre-existing concepts in terms of new information or experience. The preschooler who initially generalizes the concept of bird to include any flying object, for example, eventually revises the concept to include only particular kinds of flying objects, such as robins and sparrows, and not others, like mosquitoes or airplanes. For Piaget, assimilation and accommodation work together to enrich a child’s thinking and to create what Piaget called cognitive ''equilibrium,'' which is a balance between reliance on prior information and openness to new information. At any given time, cognitive equilibrium consists of an ever-growing repertoire of mental representations for objects and experiences. Piaget called each mental representation a ''schema'' (all of them together—the plural—was called ''schemata''). A schema was not merely a concept, but an elaborated mixture of vocabulary, actions, and experience related to the concept. A child’s schema for bird, for example, includes not only the relevant verbal knowledge (like knowing how to define the word “bird”), but also the child’s experiences with birds, pictures of birds, and conversations about birds. As assimilation and accommodation about birds and other flying objects operate together over time, the child does not just revise and add to his vocabulary (such as acquiring a new word, “butterfly”), but also adds and remembers relevant new experiences and actions. From these collective revisions and additions the child gradually constructs whole new schemata about birds, butterflies, and other flying objects. In more everyday (but also less precise) terms, Piaget might then say that “the child has learned more about birds.”

[[Figure 4]] diagrams the relationships among the Piagetian version of psychological constructivist learning. Note that the model of learning in the figure is rather “individualistic,” in the sense that it does not say much about how other people involved with the learner might assist in assimilating or accommodating information. Parents and teachers, it would seem, are left lingering on the sidelines, with few significant responsibilities for helping learners to construct knowledge. But the Piagetian picture does nonetheless imply a role for helpful others: someone, after all, has to tell or model the vocabulary needed to talk about and compare birds from airplanes and butterflies! Piaget did recognize the importance of helpful others in his writings and theorizing, calling the process of support or assistance social transmission. But he did not emphasize this aspect of constructivism. Piaget was more interested in what children and youth could figure out on their own, so to speak, than in how teachers or parents might be able to help the young to figure out (Salkind, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Salkind, N. (2004). ''An introduction to theories of human development.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;. Partly for this reason, his theory is often considered less about learning and more about ''development,'' which is long-term change in a person resulting from multiple experiences. For the same reason, educators have often found Piaget’s ideas especially helpful for thinking about students’ readiness to learn, another one of the lasting educational issues that I discussed at the beginning of this chapter. I will therefore return to Piaget in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development]], which discusses development and its importance for teaching in more detail.

===Social Constructivism: Assisted Performance===

Unlike Piaget’s rather individually oriented version of constructivism, some psychologists and educators have explicitly focused on the relationships and interactions between a learner and more knowledgeable and experienced individuals. One early expression of this viewpoint came from the American psychologist '''Jerome Bruner''' (1960, 1966, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1960). ''The process of education.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1966). ''Toward a theory of instructionl.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1996). ''The culture of education.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, who became convinced that students could usually learn more than had been traditionally expected as long as they were given appropriate guidance and resources. He called such support instructional scaffolding—literally meaning a temporary framework, like one used in constructing a building, that allows a much stronger structure to be built within it. In a comment that has been quoted widely (and sometimes disputed), he wrote, “We [constructivist educators] begin with the hypothesis that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development” (1960, p. 33). The reason for such a bold assertion was Bruner’s belief in scaffolding—his belief in the importance of providing guidance in the right way and at the right time. When scaffolding is provided, students seem more competent and “intelligent,” and they learn more.

Similar ideas were proposed independently by the Russian psychologist '''Lev Vygotsky''' (1978)&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1978). ''Mind in society.''Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, whose writing focused on how a child’s or novice’s thinking is influenced by relationships with others who are more capable, knowledgeable or expert than the learner. Vygotsky proposed that when a child (or any novice) is learning a new skill or solving a new problem, he or she can perform better if accompanied and helped by an expert than if performing alone—though still not as well as the expert. Someone who has played very little chess, for example, will probably compete against an opponent better if helped by an expert chess player than if competing alone against an opponent. Vygotsky called the difference between solo performance and assisted performance the '''zone of proximal development''' (or '''ZPD''' for short)—meaning the place or area (figuratively speaking) of immediate change. From this perspective learning is like assisted performance (Tharp &amp; Gallimore, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Tharp, R. &amp; Gallimore, R. (1991). ''Rousing minds to life.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Initially during learning, knowledge or skill is found mostly “in” the expert helper. If the expert is skilled and motivated to help, then the expert arranges experiences that allow the novice to practice crucial skills or to construct new knowledge. In this regard the expert is a bit like the coach of an athlete—offering help and suggesting ways of practicing, but never doing the actual athletic work himself or herself. Gradually, by providing continued experiences matched to the novice learner’s emerging competencies, the expert-coach makes it possible for the novice or apprentice to '''appropriate''' (or &quot;make his or her own&quot;) the skills or knowledge that originally resided only with the expert.

In both the psychological and social versions of constructivist learning, the novice is not really “taught” so much as just allowed to learn.  The social version of constructivism, however, highlights the responsibility of the expert for making learning possible. He or she must not only have knowledge and skill, but also know how to arrange experiences that make it easy and safe for learners to gain knowledge and skill themselves. These requirements sound, of course, a lot like the requirements for classroom teaching. In addition to knowing what is to be learned, the expert (i.e. the teacher) also has to break the content into manageable parts, offer the parts in a sensible sequence, provide for suitable and successful practice, bring the parts back together again at the end, and somehow relate the entire experience to knowledge and skills already meaningful to the learner.  But of course, no one said that teaching is easy!

===Implications of Constructivism for Teaching=== 

Fortunately there are strategies that teachers can use for giving students with this kind of help—in fact they are a major theme throughout this book and throughout most preservice teacher education programs. For now, let me just point briefly to two of them, saving complete discussion for later. One strategy that teachers often find helpful is to organize the content to be learned as systematically as possible, because doing this allows the teacher to select and devise learning activities that are more effective. One of the most widely used frameworks for organizing content, for example, is classification scheme proposed by the educator Benjamin Bloom, published with the somewhat imposing title of Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook #1: Cognitive Domain (Bloom, et al., 1956; Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B., et al. (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook #1: Cognitive Domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, L. &amp; Krathwohl, D. (Eds.) (2001). ''A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing.&quot; New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Bloom’s taxonomy,''' as it is usually called, describes six kinds of learning goals that teachers can in principle expect from students, ranging from simple recall of knowledge to complex evaluation of knowledge. (The levels are defined briefly in [[Table 3,]] with examples from “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.”)

Bloom’s taxonomy makes useful distinctions among possible kinds of knowledge needed by students, and therefore potentially helps in selecting activities that truly target students’ “zones of proximal development” in the sense meant by Vygotsky. A student who knows few terms for the species studied in biology unit (a problem at Bloom’s ''knowledge'' and ''comprehension'' levels), for example, may initially need support at remembering and defining the terms before he or she can make useful comparisons among species (Bloom’s analysis level). Pinpointing the most appropriate learning activities to accomplish this objective remains the job of the teacher-expert (that’s you), but the learning itself has to be accomplished by the student. Put in more social constructivist terms, the teacher arranges a zone of proximal development that allows the student to compare species successfully, but the student still has to construct or appropriate the comparisons for him or herself.
        
A second strategy may be coupled with the first. As students gain experience as students, they become able to think about how they themselves learn best, and you (as the teacher) can encourage such self-reflection as one your goals for their learning. These changes allow you to transfer some of your responsibilities for arranging learning to the students themselves. For the biology student mentioned above, for example, you may be able not only to plan activities that support comparing species, but also to devise ways for the student to think about how he or she might learn the same information independently. The resulting self-assessment and self-direction of learning often goes by the name of '''metacognition'''—an ability to think about and regulate one’s own thinking (Israel, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Israel, (2005). ''Metacognition in literacy learning.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. Metacognition can sometimes be difficult for students to achieve, but it is an important goal for social constructivist learning because it gradually frees learners from dependence on expert teachers to guide their learning. Reflective learners, you might say, become their own expert guides. Like with using Bloom’s taxonomy, though, promoting metacognition and self-directed learning is important enough that I will come back to it later in more detail (especially in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies]]).

By assigning a more visible role to expert helpers—and by implication also to teachers—than does the psychological constructivism, social constructivism is seemingly more complete as a description of what teachers usually do in classrooms, and of what they usually hope students will experience there. As we will see in the next chapter, however, there are more uses to a theory than whether it describes the moment-to-moment interactions between teacher and students. As I explain there, some theories can be helpful for planning instruction rather than for doing it. It turns out that this is the case for psychological constructivism, which offers important ideas about the appropriate sequencing of learning and development. This fact makes the psychological constructivism valuable in its own way, even though it (and a few other learning theories as well) seem to “omit” mentioning teachers, parents, or experts in detail. So do not make up your mind about the relative merits of different learning theories yet!

The '''devanagari''', the alphabet (script) used in some Indian languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Marathi]] and [[Nepali]], is a phonetic system. In principle, one letter always represents the same sound, which is relatively convenient. The sounds ''eu'' (like the [[French]] word &quot;cheveu&quot;) and ''ü'' (like the French word &quot;rue&quot;) don't exist.

The consonants are followed by the vowel &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अ&lt;/font&gt; (short ''a'') by default, but this is not written out. The sign &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;्&lt;/font&gt; is used to indicate that a consonant is not followed by the default vowel. Consonants may be modified by each of the other vowels and in this case the dependent form of the vowel is written.

There are two main difficulties:
# most consonants can be combined to form [[Hindi/Consonant_combinations|combinations]].
# the vowels are written differently depending on their position in a word - whether they are in the beginning or not and whether they follow a vowel or another consonant.

With this in mind, please continue reading this wikibook, which aims to teach more about the devanagari alphabet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Non-throwing swap&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* To implement an exception safe and efficient swap operation.
* To provide uniform interface to it to facilitate generic programming.

=== Also Known As ===
* Exception safe swap

=== Motivation ===
A typical implementation of swap could be given as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;class T&gt;
void swap (T &amp;a, T &amp;b)
{
  T temp (a);
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This can be problematic for two reasons:
;Performance: Swapping of two large, complex objects of the same type is inefficient due to acquisition and release of resources for the intermediate temporary object.
;Exception-safety: This generic swap implementation may throw if resources are not available. (Such a behavior does not make sense where in fact no new resources should have been requested in the first place.) Therefore, this implementation cannot be used for the [[More C++ Idioms/Copy-and-swap|Copy-and-swap]] idiom.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Non-throwing swap idiom uses [[More C++ Idioms/Handle Body|Handle Body]] idiom to achieve the desired effect.
The abstraction under consideration is split between two implementation classes.
One is handle and other one is body. The handle holds a pointer to a body
object. The swap is implemented as a simple swap of pointers, which are guaranted to not throw exceptions and it is very efficient as no new resources are
acquired or released.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
namespace Orange {
class String 
{
    char * str;
  public:
    void swap (String &amp;s) // throw ()
    {
      std::swap (this-&gt;str, s.str);
    }
};
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Although an efficient and exception-safe swap function can be implemented (as shown above) as a member function, non-throwing swap idiom goes further than that for simplicity, consistency, and to facilitate generic programming. An explicit specialization of std::swap should be added in the std namespace as well as the namespace of the class itself. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
namespace Orange { // namespace of String
  void swap (String &amp; s1, String &amp; s2) // throw ()
  {
    s1.swap (s2);
  }
}
namespace std {
  template &lt;&gt;
  void swap (Orange::String &amp; s1, Orange::String &amp; s2) // throw ()
  {
    s1.swap (s2);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Adding it in two places takes care of two different common usage styles of swap (1) unqualified swap (2) fully qualified swap (e.g., std::swap). When unqualified swap is used, right swap is looked up using Koenig lookup (provided one is already defined). If fully qualified swap is used, Koenig lookup is suppressed and one in the std namespace is used instead. It is a very common practice. Remaining discussion here uses fully qualified swap only. It gives a uniform look and feel because C++ programmers often use swap function in an idiomatic way by fully qualifying it with '''std::''' as shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
void zoo (T t1, T t2) {
//...
int i1, i2;
std::swap(i1,i2); // note uniformity
std::swap(t1,t2); // Ditto here
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In such a case, the right, efficient implementation of swap is chosen when zoo is instantiated with String class defined earlier. Otherwise, the default std::swap function template would be instantiated -- completely defeating the purpose of defining the member swap and namespace scope swap function. This idiom of defining explicit specialization of swap in std namespace is particularly useful in generic programming.

Such uniformity in using non-throwing swap idiom leads to its cascading use as given in the
example below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class UserDefined 
{
    String str;
  public:
    void swap (UserDefined &amp; u) // throw () 
    { 
      std::swap (str, u.str); 
    }
};
namespace std
{
  // Full specializations of the templates in std namespace can be added in std namespace.
  template &lt;&gt;
  void swap (UserDefined &amp; u1, UserDefined &amp; u2) // throw ()
  {
    u1.swap (u2);
  }
}
class Myclass
{
    UserDefined u;
    char * name;
  public:
    void swap (Myclass &amp; m) // throw ()
    {
      std::swap (u, m.u);       // cascading use of the idiom due to uniformity
      std::swap (name, m.name); // Ditto here
    }   
}
namespace std
{
   // Full specializations of the templates in std namespace can be added in std namespace.
   template &lt;&gt; 
   void swap (Myclass &amp; m1, Myclass &amp; m2) // throw ()
   {
     m1.swap (m2);
   }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Therefore, it is a good idea to define a specialization of std::swap for the types that are amenable to an exception safe, efficient swap implementation. The C++ standard does not currently allow us to add new templates to the std namespace, but it does allow us to specialize templates (e.g. std::swap) from that namespace and add them back in it.

=== Caveats ===
Using non-throwing swap idiom for template classes (e.g., Matrix&lt;T&gt;) can be a subtle issue. As per the C++98 standard, only the full specialization of std::swap is allowed to be defined inside std namespace for the user-defined types. Partial specializations or function overloading is not allowed by the language. Trying to achieve the similar effect for template classes (e.g., Matrix&lt;T&gt;) results into overloading of std::swap in std namepspace, which is technically undefined behavior. This is not necessarily the ideal state of affairs as indicated by some people in a spectacularly long discussion thread on comp.lang.c++.moderated newsgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two possible solutions, both imperfect, to this issue:

=== Intent ===
To create an exception safe implementation of overloaded assignment operator.

=== Also Known As ===

'''Create-Temporary-and-Swap'''

=== Motivation ===
Exception safety is a very important corner stone of highly reliable C++
software that uses exceptions to indicate &quot;exceptional&quot; conditions. There 
are at least 3 types of exception safety levels: basic, strong, and no-throw.
Basic exception safety should be offered always as it is usually 
cheap to implement. Guaranteeing strong exception safety may not be possible in 
all the cases.
Create a temporary and swap idiom elegantly implements a strongly
exception safe assignment operator.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Create a temporary and swap idiom acquires new resource before it forfeits its
current resource. To acquire the new resource, it uses RAII idiom. If the acquisition of the new resource is successful, it exchanges the resources using the [[More C++ Idioms/Non-throwing swap|non-throwing swap]] idiom. Finally, the old resource is released as a side effect of using RAII in the first step. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class String
{
    char * str; 
  public:
    String &amp; operator = (const String &amp;s)
    {
      String temp (s); // Copy-constructor -- RAII
      temp.swap (*this); // Non-throwing swap
      return *this;
    }// Old resources released when destructor of temp is called.

    void swap (String &amp;s) throw () // Also see the non-throwing swap idiom
    {
       std::swap(this-&gt;str, s.str);
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;
Some variations of the above implementation are also possible. A check for self assignment is not strictly necessary but can give some performance improvements in (rarely occurring) self-assignment cases.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class String
{
    char * str;
  public:
    String &amp; operator = (const String &amp;s)
    {
      if (this != &amp;s)
        String(s).swap (*this); // Copy-constructor and non-throwing swap
      // Old resources are released with the destruction of the temporary above
      return *this;
    }

    void swap (String &amp;s) throw () // Also see non-throwing swap idiom
    {
       std::swap(this-&gt;str, s.str);
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

'''copy elision and copy-and-swap idiom'''

Strictly speaking, explicit creation of a temporary inside the assignment operator is not necessary. The parameter (right hand side) of the assignment operator can be passed-by-value to the function. The parameter itself serves as a temporary. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
String &amp; operator = (String s) // the pass-by-value parameter serves as a temporary
{
   s.swap (*this); // Non-throwing swap
   return *this;
}// Old resources released when destructor of s is called.
&lt;/source&gt;

This is not just a matter of convenience but in fact an optimization. If the parameter (s) binds to an lvalue (another non-const object), a copy of the object is made automatically while creating the parameter (s). However, when s binds to an rvalue (temporary object, literal), the copy is typically elided, which saves a call to a copy constructor and a destructor.  In the earlier version of the assignment operator where the parameter is accepted as const reference, copy elision does not happen when the reference binds to an rvalue. This results in an additional object being created and destroyed.

In C++11, such an assignment operator is known as a '''unifying''' assignment operator because it eliminates the need to write two different assignment operators: copy-assignment and move-assignment. As long as a class has a move-constructor, a C++11 compiler will always use it to optimize creation of a copy from another temporary (rvalue). Copy-elision is a comparable optimization in non-C++11 compilers to achieve the same effect.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
String createString(); // a function that returns a String object.
String s;
s = createString(); 
// right hand side is a rvalue. Pass-by-value style assignment operator 
// could be more efficient than pass-by-const-reference style assignment 
// operator.
&lt;/source&gt;

Not every class benefits from this style of assignment operator. Consider a String assignment operator, which releases old memory and allocates new memory only if the existing memory is insufficient to hold a copy of the right hand side String object. To implement this optimization, one would have to write a custom assignment operator. Since a new String copy would nullify the memory allocation optimization, this custom assignment operator would have to avoid copying its argument to any temporary Strings, and in particular would need to accept its parameter by const reference.

=== Intent ===
Minimize the capacity of a container just enough to hold existing range.

=== Also Known As ===
&quot;Swap-To-Fit&quot;, introduced by Scott Meyers in his book &quot;Effective STL&quot;.

=== Motivation ===
Standard library containers often allocate more memory than the actual number of elements
in them. Such a policy results in an optimization of saving some allocations
when a container grows in size. On the other hand, when size of the container
reduces, there is often leftover capacity in the container. The leftover capacity
of the container can be unnecessary wastage of memory resources. Shrink-to-fit
idiom has been developed to reduce the extra capacity to a minimum required
capacity and thereby saving memory resources.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Shrink-to-fit idiom is as simple as the one given below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
//v is swapped with its temporary copy, which is capacity optimal
std::vector&lt;int&gt;(v).swap(v);
&lt;/source&gt;

The first half of the statement, &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;(v)&lt;/code&gt;, creates a temporary vector of integers and it is guaranteed&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 14882:1998 does not appear to document this behavior of the copy constructor.  Where is this behavior guaranteed?&lt;/ref&gt; to allocate memory just enough to hold all the elements in the parameter, &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;. The second half of the statement swaps the temporary vector with &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; using the non-throwing swap member function. &lt;code&gt;swap()&lt;/code&gt; is very efficient, amounting to little more than swapping pointers between the vectors. After swapping, the temporary goes out of scope and deletes the memory originally held by &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;, whereas &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; retains the memory allocated by the temporary, so it has just enough to hold the original elements in &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;references/&gt;

A more reliable solution (notably for &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;, which may be implemented using ''reference counting'', but also for &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;, whose copy-constructor might copy the other vector's excess capacity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aristeia.com/BookErrata/estl1e-errata.html (search for &quot;string(s.begin(), s.end()).swap(s)&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;) is to use the &quot;range constructor&quot; instead of the copy constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
//v is swapped with its temporary copy, which is capacity optimal
std::vector&lt;int&gt;(v.begin(), v.end()).swap(v);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;references/&gt;

=== Solution in C++11 ===
In C++11 some containers declare such idiom as function &lt;tt&gt;shrink_to_fit()&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g. vector, deque, basic_string. &lt;tt&gt;shrink_to_fit()&lt;/tt&gt; is a non-binding request to reduce &lt;tt&gt;capacity()&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;size()&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Intent ===
Clear a container and minimize the capacity of the container.

=== Also Known As ===
This is sometimes called the ''swap with temporary'' idiom.

=== Motivation ===
Standard library containers often allocate more memory than the actual number of elements
in them. Such a policy results in an optimization of saving some allocations
when a container grows in size. On the other hand, when size of the container
reduces, there is often leftover capacity in the container. The leftover capacity
of the container can be unnecessary wastage of memory resources. clear-and-minimize
idiom has been developed to clear a container and reduce the extra capacity to 
a minimum of zero and thereby saving memory resources.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Clear-and-minimize idiom is as simple as the one given below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::vector &lt;int&gt; v;
//... Lots of push_backs and then lots of remove on v.
std::vector&lt;int&gt;().swap (v);
&lt;/source&gt;
The first half of the statement, std::vector&lt;int&gt;() creates a temporary vector of integers and it is guaranteed to allocate zero raw memory or an implementation minimum. The second half of the statement swaps the temporary vector with v using non-throwing swap idiom, which is efficient. After swapping, the temporary created by the compiler goes out of scope and the chunk of memory originally held by v is released.

=== Solution in C++0x ===
In C++0x, some containers declare the function &lt;tt&gt;shrink_to_fit()&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g. vector, deque, basic_string. &lt;tt&gt;shrink_to_fit()&lt;/tt&gt; which is a non-binding request to reduce &lt;tt&gt;capacity()&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;size()&lt;/tt&gt;. Thus, using &lt;tt&gt;clear()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;shrink_to_fit()&lt;/tt&gt; is a non-binding request to clear-and-minimize.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Counted Body/Reference Counting (intrusive)&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Manage logical sharing of a resource/object, prevent expensive copying, and allow proper resource deallocation of objects that use dynamically allocated resources.
=== Also Known As ===
* [[More C++ Idioms/Counted Body|Reference Counting]] (intrusive)
* Counted Body

=== Motivation ===
When [[More C++ Idioms/Handle Body#Pointer To Implementation (pImpl) | Handle/Body]] idiom is used, quite often it is noticed that copying of bodies is expensive. This is because copying of bodies involves allocation of memory and copy construction. Copying can be avoided by using pointers and references, but these leave the problem of who is responsible for cleaning up the object. Some handle must be responsible for releasing memory resources allocated for the body. Usually it is the last one. Without automatic reclamation of memory resources of memory, it leaves a user-visible distinction between built-in types and user-defined types.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The solution is to add a reference count to the body class to facilitate memory management; hence the name &quot;Counted Body.&quot; Memory management is added to the handle class, particularly to its implementation of initialization, assignment, copying, and destruction.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class StringRep {
  friend class String;

  friend std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, StringRep const &amp;str) {
    out &lt;&lt; &quot;[&quot; &lt;&lt; str.data_ &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; str.count_ &lt;&lt; &quot;]&quot;;
    return out;
  }

 public:
  StringRep(const char *s) : count_(1) {
    strcpy(data_ = new char[strlen(s) + 1], s);
  }

  ~StringRep() { delete[] data_; }

 private:
  int count_;
  char *data_;
};

class String {
 public:
  String() : rep(new StringRep(&quot;&quot;)) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;empty ctor: &quot; &lt;&lt; *rep &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
  String(const String &amp;s) : rep(s.rep) {
    rep-&gt;count_++;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;String ctor: &quot; &lt;&lt; *rep &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
  }

  }

    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;before assign: &quot; &lt;&lt; *s.rep &lt;&lt; &quot; to &quot; &lt;&lt; *rep &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
    String(s).swap(*this);  // copy-and-swap idiom
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;after assign: &quot; &lt;&lt; *s.rep &lt;&lt; &quot; , &quot; &lt;&lt; *rep &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
    return *this;
  }
  ~String() {  // StringRep deleted only when the last handle goes out of scope.
    if (rep &amp;&amp; --rep-&gt;count_ &lt;= 0) {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;dtor: &quot; &lt;&lt; *rep &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
      delete rep;
    }
  }

 private:
  void swap(String &amp;s) throw() { std::swap(this-&gt;rep, s.rep); }

  StringRep *rep;
};
int main() {

  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;*** init String a with empty\n&quot;;
  String a;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n*** assign a to \&quot;A\&quot;\n&quot;;
  a = &quot;A&quot;;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n*** init String b with \&quot;B\&quot;\n&quot;;
  String b = &quot;B&quot;;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n*** b-&gt;a\n&quot;;
  a = b;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n*** init c with a\n&quot;;
  String c(a);

  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n*** init d with \&quot;D\&quot;\n&quot;;
  String d(&quot;D&quot;);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Gratuitous copying is avoided, leading to a more efficient implementation. This idiom presumes that the programmer can edit the source code for the body. When that's not possible, use Detached Counted Body. When counter is stored inside body class, it is called intrusive reference counting and when the counter is stored external to the body class it is known as non-intrusive reference counting. This implementation is a variation of shallow copy with the semantics of deep copy and the efficiency of Smalltalk name-value pairs.

The output should be as below:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
*** init String a with empty
empty ctor: [, 1]

*** assign a to &quot;A&quot;
char ctor:[A, 1]
before assign: [A, 1] to [, 1]
String ctor: [A, 2]
dtor: [, 0]
after assign: [A, 2] , [A, 2]

*** init String b with &quot;B&quot;
char ctor:[B, 1]

*** b-&gt;a
before assign: [B, 1] to [A, 1]
String ctor: [B, 2]
dtor: [A, 0]
after assign: [B, 2] , [B, 2]

*** init c with a
String ctor: [B, 3]

*** init d with &quot;D&quot;
char ctor:[D, 1]
dtor: [D, 0]
dtor: [B, 0]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Consequences ===
Creation of multiple reference counts will result into multiple deletion of the same body, which is undefined. Care must be taken to avoid creating multiple reference counts to the same body. Intrusive reference counting easily supports it. With non-intrusive reference counting, programmer discipline is required to prevent duplicate reference counts. 

=== Known Uses ===
* boost::shared_ptr (non-intrusive reference counting)
* boost::intrusive_ptr (intrusive reference counting)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Concrete Data Type&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To control object's scope and lifetime by allowing or disallowing dynamic allocation using the free store (heap)
=== Also Known As ===
{{Empty section}}
=== Motivation ===
C++ provides two ways of controlling lifetime of an object and binding it with a program level identifier (variable). First is a scoped variable and an object, which are destroyed immediately after the scope ends (''e.g.,'' function scope integers). Second is a scoped variable (often a pointer) and a dynamically allocated object in the free store. In this case, at the end of the scope of the variable, the variable ceases to exist but the object's lifetime continues (''e.g.,'' singletons, a window object). It is possible to force the choice of the lifetime of an object either first way or the second using the Concrete Data Type idiom.
=== Solution and Sample Code ===
This idiom simply uses class level access modifiers (private, protected) to achieve the goal.
The following code shows how a MouseEventHandler class forces dynamic allocation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class EventHandler 
{
  public:
    virtual ~EventHandler () {}
};
class MouseEventHandler : public EventHandler // Note inheritance
{
  protected:
    ~MouseEventHandler () {} // A protected virtual destructor.
  public:
    MouseEventHandler () {} // Public Constructor.
};
int main (void)
{
  MouseEventHandler m; // A scoped variable is not allowed as destructor is protected.
  EventHandler *e = new MouseEventHandler (); // Dynamic allocation is allowed
  delete e;  // Polymorphic delete. Does not leak memory.
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Another way to force dynamic allocation is to prevent direct access to the constructor and instead provide a static function instance() to return a dynamically allocated object. It is in many ways similar to the Singleton design pattern. Moreover, it is not strictly necessary to use polymorphic delete to reclaim memory. A member function destroy() can serve the purpose saving the space required for a v-table pointer. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class MouseEventHandler // Note no inheritance
{
  protected:
    MouseEventHandler () {} // Protected Constructor.
    ~MouseEventHandler () {} // A protected, non-virtual destructor.
  public:
    static MouseEventHandler * instance () { return new MouseEventHandler(); }
    void destroy () { delete this; }  // Reclaim memory.
};
&lt;/source&gt;

An opposite extreme of this idiom is to force scoped variable (a.k.a. automatic variable) only. It can be achieved using a private new operator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class ScopedLock
{
  private:
    static void * operator new (size_t size); // Disallow dynamic allocation
    static void * operator new (size_t, void * mem);  // Disallow placement new as well.
};
int main (void)
{
   ScopedLock s; // Allowed
   ScopedLock * sl = new ScopedLock (); // Standard new and nothrow new are not allowed.
   void * buf = ::operator new (sizeof (ScopedLock));
   ScopedLock * s2 = new(buf) ScopedLock;  // Placement new is also not allowed
}
&lt;/source&gt;

ScopedLock object can't be allocated dynamically with standard uses of new operator, nothrow new, and the placement new.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Algebraic Hierarchy&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To hide multiple closely related algebraic abstractions (numbers) behind a single generic
abstraction and provide a generic interface to it.

=== Also Known As ===
* '''State''' (Gamma et al.)

=== Motivation ===
In pure object-oriented languages like Smalltalk, variables are run-time 
bindings to objects that act like labels. Binding a variable to an object is
like sticking a label on it. Assignment in these languages is analogous to 
peeling a label off one object and putting it on another. On the other hand,
in C and C++, variables are synonyms for addresses or offsets instead of being
labels for objects. Assignment does not mean re-labelling, it means overwriting
old contents with new one. Algebraic Hierarchy idiom uses delegated polymorphism
to simulate weak variable to object binding in C++. Algebraic Hierarchy uses 
[[More C%2B%2B Idioms/Envelope Letter|Envelope Letter]] idiom in its implementation.
The motivation behind this idiom is to be able write code like the one below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Number n1 = Complex (1, 2); // Label n1 for a complex number
Number n2 = Real (10); // Label n2 for a real number
Number n3 = n1 + n2; // Result of addition is labelled n3
Number n2 = n3; // Re-labelling
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Complete code showing implementation of Algebraic Hierarchy idiom is shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cognitive Development: The Theory of Jean Piaget==

''Cognition''' refers to thinking and memory processes, and '''cognitive development''' refers to long-term changes in these processes. While cognition has been studied from several different perspectives and in the light of several theories, the one that is both the most widely known among educators and the most frankly “developmental” is the cognitive stage theory of a Swiss psychologist named '''Jean Piaget'''. Piaget created and studied an account of how children and youth gradually become able to think logically and scientifically. This section of Chapter 3 focuses exclusively on Piaget’s ideas.  Other cognitive perspectives and research—the ones that are not as fully “developmental”—are discussed in later chapters, especially [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies]].

Remember my brief comments in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]] about how Piaget explained learning? There, I described Piaget as a ''psychological constructivist'': in his view, learning proceeded by the interplay of assimilation (adjusting new experiences to fit prior concepts) and accommodation (adjusting concepts to fit new experiences). The to-and-fro of these two processes leads not only to short-term learning, as I pointed out in Chapter 2, but also to long-term ''developmental change''. The long-term developments are really the main focus of Piaget’s cognitive theory.

Because of close observation of his own three children, and later of other children and youth, Piaget proposed that cognition developed through distinct '''stages''' from birth through the end of adolescence. By stages he meant a sequence of thinking patterns with four key features: 1) they always happened in the same order, 2) no stage was ever skipped, and 3) each stage was a significant transformation of the stage before it, and 4) each later stage incorporated the earlier stages into itself. Basically this is the “staircase” model of development that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Piaget proposed four major stages of cognitive development, and called them 1) sensorimotor intelligence, 2) preoperational thinking, 3) concrete operational thinking, and 4) formal operational thinking. Each stage is correlated with a particular age period of childhood or adolescence, though only rather approximately.

===The Sensorimotor Stage: Birth to Age 2===

In Piaget’s theory, the sensorimotor stage comes first, and is defined as the time when infants “think” mainly through their senses and motor actions. As every new parent will attest, infants touch, manipulate, look, listen to, and even bite and chew objects. These actions allow them to learn about the world and are crucial to their early cognitive development.

The infant’s actions allow the child to represent (or construct simple concepts of ) objects and events. A toy animal may be just a confusing array of sensations at first, but by acting on it repeatedly, the child gradually organizes the sensations and actions into a stable concept, toy animal. The representation acquires a permanence lacking in the individual experiences of the object; because of it, the child “knows,” or at least believes, that toy animal exists even if the actual toy animal is temporarily out of sight. Piaget called this sense of stability object permanence, a belief that objects exist whether or not they are experienced currently. It is a major achievement of sensorimotor development, and marks a qualitative transformation in how older infants (24 months) think about experience compared to younger infants (6 months).

During much of infancy, of course, a child can only barely talk, so a lot of sensorimotor development happens without the support of language. It might therefore seem hard to learn what infants are thinking, but Piaget devised several simple, but clever experiments to get around their lack of language, and that suggest that infants do indeed represent objects even without being able to talk (Piaget, 1952)&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1952). ''The origins of intelligence in children.'' New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In one, for example, he showed that hiding an object (like a toy animal) under a blanket consistently prompts an older infant (18-24 months) to search for the object, but fails to prompt a younger infant (less than six months) to do so.  (You can try this too if you happen to have access to young infant.) “Something” motivates the search by the older infant even without the benefit of much language, and presumably the “something” is a permanent concept or representation of the object.

===The Preoperational Stage: Age 2 to 7===

In the preoperational stage, children use their new ability to represent objects in a wide variety of activities, but they do not yet do it in organized, fully logical ways. One of the most obvious examples of this phase of cognition is dramatic play, the improvised make-believe of preschool children. If you have ever had responsibility for preschool children, you have very likely witnessed dramatic play. Ashley holds a plastic banana to her ear and says, “Hello, Mom? Can you be sure to bring me my baby doll? OK!” Then she hangs up the banana and pours tea for Jeremy into an invisible cup. Jeremy, who has been watching, giggles at the sight of all of this, and exclaims, “Ringing! Oh Ashley, the phone is ringing again! You better answer it.” And so on.

In a way, children immersed in make-believe behave like the mentally insane, in that they do not think realistically. But they are not truly insane because they have not taken leave of their senses completely. At some level, Ashley and Jeremy both know that the banana is still a banana and not really a telephone; they are merely representing it as a telephone. They are thinking on two levels at once—one imaginative and the other realistic. This dual processing of experience makes dramatic play an early example of metacognition, or reflecting on and monitoring thinking itself. As I explained in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]], metacognition is a highly desirable skill for success in school, one that teachers often encourage (Bredekamp &amp; Copple, 1997; Paley, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Bredekamp, S. &amp; Copple, C. (1997). ''Developmentally appropriate practice, Revised edition.'' Washington, D.C.: National Association for the Education of Young Children.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paley, V. (2005). ''A child's work: The importance of fantasy play.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Partly for this reason, teachers of young children (in preschool, kindergarten and even into first or second grade) often make time and space in their classrooms for dramatic play, and may even get involved in it on the sidelines in an effort to extend the play further.

===The Concrete Operational Stage: Age 7 to 11===

As children continue in elementary school, they become able to represent ideas and events more flexibly and logically. The rules of their thinking may seem very basic by adult standards and usually operate unconsciously, but nonetheless they allow children to solve problems more systematically than before, and therefore to be successful with many academic tasks. In the concrete operational stage, for example, a child may unconsciously follow the rule that “if nothing is added or taken away, then the amount of something stays the same.” This simple principle helps in understanding certain arithmetic tasks, such as in adding or subtracting zero from a number, as well as in understanding certain classroom science experiments, such as ones involving judgments of the amounts of liquids when mixed. Piaget called this period the concrete operational stage because children mentally “operate” on concrete objects and events. They are not yet able, however, to operate (or think) systematically about representations of objects or events. Manipulating representations is a more abstract skill that does not develop until later, during adolescence.

Concrete operational thinking differs from preoperational thinking in two important ways, each of which makes children more skilled as students. One difference is reversibility, or the ability to think about the steps of a process in any order. Imagine a simple science experiment, for example, such as one to explore which of several objects sink and which ones float. Both the preoperational and concrete operational child can recall and describe the steps in this experiment, but only the concrete operational child can recall them in any order. This skill is very helpful on any number of classroom tasks involving multiple steps. In teaching new vocabulary from a story, for example, a teacher might tell students to “first make a list of words in the story that you do not know, then find and write down their definitions, and finally then get a friend to test you on your list.” These directions involve repeatedly remembering to move back and forth between a second step and a first—a task that concrete operational students—and most adults—find easy, but that preoperational children often forget to do or find confusing. If the latter children are to do this task reliably, they may need external prompts, such as having the teacher remind them periodically to go back to the story to look for more unknown words.

The other new feature of thinking during the concrete operational stage is the child’s ability to decenter, or focus on more than one feature of a problem or task at a time. There are hints of decentration in preschool children’s dramatic play, which requires being aware on two levels at once—knowing that a banana can be both a banana and a “telephone.” But the decentration of the concrete operational stage is more deliberate and conscious than preschoolers’ make-believe. Now the child can attend to two things at once quite purposely. Suppose you give students a sheet with a mixture of subtraction problems on it, and ask them to do this: “Find all of the problems that involve two-digit subtraction and involve ‘borrowing’ from the next column. Circle and solve only those problems.” Following these instructions is quite possible for a concrete operational student (as long as they have been listening to you!) because the student can attend to the two subtasks simultaneously—finding the two-digit problems and identifying which of them actually involve borrowing. (Whether the student actually knows how to “borrow,” however, or only how to identify examples of such problems, is a separate question.)

In real classroom tasks, reversibility and decentration often happen together. A well-known example of joint presence is Piaget’s experiments with conservation, the belief that an amount or quantity stays the same even if it changes apparent size or shape (Piaget, 2001; Matthews, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (2001). ''The psychology of intelligence.'' Oxford, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, G. (1998). ''The philosophy of childhood.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Imagine two identical balls made of clay. Any child, whether preoperational or concrete operational, will agree that the two indeed have the same amount of clay in them. But if you now squish one of the balls into a long, thin “hot dog,” the preoperational child is likely to say that the amount of that ball has changed—either because it is longer or because it is thinner, but at any rate because it is now different. The concrete operational child will not make this mistake, thanks to new cognitive skills of reversibility and decentration: for him or her, the amount is the same because “you could squish it back into a ball again” (reversibility) and because “it may be longer, but it is also thinner” (decentration). Piaget would say the concrete operational child “has conservation of quantity.”

In a sense the classroom examples that I described above also involve reversibility and decentration jointly. As already mentioned, the vocabulary activity requires reversibility (going back and forth between identifying words and looking up their meanings); but it can also be construed as an example of decentration (keeping in mind two tasks at once—word identification and dictionary search). And as mentioned, the arithmetic activity requires decentration (looking for problems that meet two criteria and also solving them), but it can also be construed as an example of reversibility (going back and forth between subtasks, as with the vocabulary activity). Either way, the development of concrete operational skills can support students in many basic academic tasks.

===The Formal Operational Stage: Age 11 and Beyond===

The last of the Piagetian stages resembles the concrete operational stage, except that the young person becomes able to reason not only about tangible objects and events, but also about hypothetical or abstract ones. Hence it has the name formal operational stage—the period when the individual can “operate” on “forms” or representations. With students at this level, the teacher can pose hypothetical (or contrary-to-fact) problems: “What if the George Washington had lost the American Revolutionary War?” or “What if the first white explorers had settled first in California instead of on the East Coast of North America?” To answer these questions, students must use hypothetical reasoning, meaning that they must manipulate information that varies in several ways at once, and do so entirely in their minds.

Piaget was primarily concerned with hypothetical reasoning about scientific problems, and his studies of formal operational thinking therefore often look a lot like problems that middle- or high-school teachers might pose in a science class. In one, for example, a young person is presented with a simple pendulum, to which different amounts of weight can be hung (Inhelder &amp; Piaget, 1958)&lt;ref&gt;Inhelder, B. &amp; Piaget, J. (1958). ''The growth of logical thinking from childhood to adolescence.&quot; New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. The experimenter asks, “What determines how fast the pendulum swings: the length of the string holding it, the weight attached to it, or the distance that it is pulled to the side?” The young person is not allowed to solve this problem by trial-and-error with the materials themselves, but must reason a way to the solution mentally. To do so systematically, he or she must imagine that varying each factor separately, while imagining the other factors are held constant. This kind of thinking requires facility at manipulating the relevant objects and actions mentally—precisely what formal operations are about.

As you might imagine, students with an ability to think hypothetically have an advantage in doing certain kinds of school work: by definition, they require relatively few “props” to solve problems. In this sense they can, in principle, be more self-directed than students you rely only on concrete operations—certainly a desirable quality in the opinion of most teachers. Note, though, that although formal operational thinking may be desirable, it is not sufficient for school success, and it is far from being the only way that students achieve educational success. Being capable of formal or hypothetical thinking does not insure that a student is motivated or well-behaved, for example, nor does it mean that a student also has other desirable skills or qualities, such as ability at sports, music, or art. The fourth stage in Piaget’s theory is really about a particular kind of formal thinking, the kind needed to solve scientific problems and devise scientific experiments. Since many people do not normally deal with these sorts of problems in the normal course of their lives, it should be no surprise that research finds that many people never achieve or use formal thinking fully or consistently, or that they use it only in selected areas with which they are very familiar (Case &amp; Okomato, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. &amp; Okomato, U. (1996). ''The role of central conceptual structures in children's thought.'' Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Social Development: Relationships and Personal Motives==
'''Social development''' refers to the long-term changes in relationships and interactions involving self, peers, and family. It includes both positive changes, such as how friendships develop, and negative changes, such as aggression or bullying.

Social development refers to the long-term changes in relationships and interactions involving self, peers, and family. It includes both positive changes, such as how friendships develop, and negative changes, such as aggression or bullying. For teachers, the social developments that are the most obviously relevant to classroom life fall into three main areas: 1) changes in self-concept and in relationships among students and teachers, 2) changes in basic needs or personal motives, and 3) changes in your sense of rights and responsibilities. As with cognitive development, each of these areas has a broad, well-known theory (and theorist) that provides a framework for thinking about the area as it relates to teaching. For development of self-concept and relationships, it is the theory of '''Erik Erikson'''; for development of personal motives, it is the theory of '''Abraham Maslow'''; and for development of ethical knowledge and beliefs, it is the work of '''Lawrence Kohlberg''' and his critic, '''Carol Gilligan'''. These psychologists and their theories are definitely not the only ones related to social development of students, and their ideas are often debated by other researchers. But their accounts do explain much about social development that is relevant to teaching, learning, and students.

===Erik Erikson: Eight Psychosocial Crises of Development===

Like Piaget, Erik Erikson developed a theory of social development that relies on stages, except that Erikson saw his stages as a series of psychological or social (or '''psychosocial''') '''crises'''—turning points in a person’s relationships and feelings about himself or herself (Erikson, 1963, 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E. (1963). ''Childhood and society.'' New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E. (1980). ''Identity and the life cycle.'' New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;. Each crisis presents the person with a dilemma or choice in which each alternative had both advantages and risks, but in which one alternative is normally considered more desirable or “healthy.” How a crisis is resolved affects how later crises are resolved. The resolution also helps to create an individual’s long-term personality. Erikson proposed eight crises that extend from birth through old age; they are summarized in [[Table 3-2]]. Four of the stages occur during the school years, so I give these special attention here, but it is helpful also to know what crises are thought to come both before and after those in the school years.
 
====Crises of Infants and Preschoolers: Trust, Autonomy, and Initiative====

Almost from the day they are born, infants face a crisis (in Erikson’s sense) about '''trust and mistrust'''. They are happiest if they can eat, sleep, and excrete according to their own physiological schedules, and their major caregiver (often the mother) is in a position to make these activities comfortable by her own flexibility and constant attentiveness. Unfortunately, though, a young infant is in no position to control or influence a mother’s caregiving behavior; so the baby faces a dilemma about how much to trust or mistrust the mother’s helpfulness. Hopefully, between the two of them, they resolve this choice in favor of trust: the mother proves herself at least “good enough” in her attentiveness, and the baby risks trusting her motivation and skill at caregiving.

Almost as soon as this crisis is resolved, however, a new one develops over the issue of '''autonomy and shame'''. The child (who is now a toddler) may basically trust his or her caregiver (mother), but the very trust contributes to a desire to assert autonomy by taking care of basic personal needs, such as feeding, toileting, or dressing. Given the child’s lack of experience in doing so, however, self-care is risky at first—the toddler may feed (or toilet or dress) clumsily and ineffectively. The child’s caregiver, for her part, risks overprotecting the child and criticizing his early efforts unnecessarily and causing the child to feel shame for even trying. Hopefully, as with the earlier crisis of trust, the new crisis gets resolved in favor of autonomy through the combined efforts of the child to exercise autonomy and of the caregiver to support the child’s efforts.

Eventually, about the time a child is of preschool age, the autonomy exercised during the previous period becomes more elaborate, extended, and focused on objects and people other than the child and his or her basic needs. The child at a day care center may undertake, for example, to build the “biggest city in the world” out of all available unit blocks—even if other children want some of the blocks for other purposes. The child’s projects and desires create a new crisis of '''initiative and guilt''', because the child soon realizes that not every impulse or desire can be acted upon, even if the desires have a pesky tendency to linger when unfulfilled. As with the crisis over autonomy, caregivers have to support the child’s initiatives where possible, but also not make the child feel guilty just for desiring to have or to do something inappropriate or impossible. By limiting behavior where necessary but not limiting internal feelings, the child can develop a lasting ability to take initiative. In Erikson’s terms, the crisis is resolved in favor of initiative.

Even though only the last of these three crises overlaps with the school years, all three of them relate to issues faced by students of many ages, as well as their teachers. A child or youth who is fundamentally mistrustful, for example, has a serious problem in coping with school life. If you are a student, it is essential for your long-term survival, to believe that teachers and other school officials have your best interests at heart, and that they are not imposing assignments, setting limits, and the like, “just for the heck of it.” And even though students are hardly infants, teachers are like Erikson’s caregiver in that they need to prove worthy of students’ trust through their initial flexibility and attentiveness.

Classroom parallels also exist for the crises of autonomy and of initiative. To learn effectively, students need to make choices and undertake academic initiatives, at least some of the time and even though not every choice or initiative may be practical or desirable. Teachers, for their part, need to make true choices and initiatives possible, and refrain from criticizing, even accidentally, the act of choice or the intention behind an initiative even when the teacher privately believes that it is “bound to fail.” Support for choice and initiative should be focused on providing resources and on guiding the student’s efforts toward more likely success. In this underlying sense teachers are like the parents of toddlers and preschoolers in Erikson’s theory of development.

====The Crisis of Childhood: Industry and Inferiority====

Once into elementary school, the child is faced for the first time with becoming competent and worthy in the eyes of the world at large, or more precisely of classmates and teachers. To achieve their esteem, he or she must develop skills and qualities that usually require effort that is both sustained and somewhat focused. The challenge of doing so creates the crisis of '''industry and inferiority'''. To be respected by teachers, the child must learn to read, for example, and to behave like a “true student”; to be respected by peers, he or she must learn to cooperate and to be friendly, among other things. There is risk involved in undertaking to achieve these skills and qualities, because there can be no guarantee in advance of success with them. If the child does succeed, he or she experiences the satisfaction of a job well done and of skills well learned; if not, the child risks feeling lasting inferiority compared to others. Teachers therefore have a very direct, explicit role in helping students to resolve this crisis in favor of industry or success. They can, for example, set realistic academic goals for students—ones that will probably lead to success—and then provide the materials and assistance that students need to reach the goals. Teachers can also frequently express their belief that students can meet their goals even when the students get discouraged, and avoid any hints (even accidental ones) that a student is simply a “loser.” Paradoxically, these strategies will work best if the teacher is also tolerant of less-than-perfect performance by students. Too much emphasis on perfection can undermine some students’ confidence—foster Erikson’s inferiority—by making academic goals seem beyond reach.

====The Crisis of Adolescence: Identity and Role Confusion====

As the child develops lasting talents and attitudes as a result of the crisis of industry, he begins to face a new question: what do all these talents and attitudes add up to be? Who is the “me” embedded in this profile of talents and attitudes? These questions are the crisis of '''identity and role confusion'''. It is riskier than it may first appear for a person simply to define himself or herself as identical to the profile of talents and attitudes developed in childhood. For one thing, some of them may be poorly developed and other may be undesirable in your eyes or in the eyes of others. Still others may be valuable but fail to be noticed by others in a person’s world. So who a person wants to be may not be the same as who he or she actually is, or the same as who others want the person to be. Role confusion is the result.

Teachers can minimize the risk and extent of confusion in a number of ways. One is to provide students with lots of diverse role models—by pointing them out in students’ reading materials, for example, and by inviting a diversity of guests to school. The point of these strategies is to express a key idea, that there are many ways to be respected, successful, and satisfied with life. Another way to support students’ identity development is to be alert to students’ confusions and stresses about their futures, and refer them to counselors or other services outside school that can help them sort these out. Still another strategy for teachers is to tolerate changes in students’ goals and priorities—seemingly sudden or drastic changes in extra-curricular activities or plans for after graduation. Remember, in these cases, that students are trying on roles, and that discouraging their experimentation prematurely may not be in students’ best interests.

====The Crises of Adulthood: Intimacy, Generativity, and Integrity====

Beyond the school years, according to Erikson, individuals continue psychosocial development through facing additional crises. The next one is faced by young adults, and is called the crisis of '''intimacy and isolation'''. It is about risking the establishment of close relationships with a select number of other individuals. Whether the relationships may be heterosexual, homosexual, or not sexual at all, their defining quality is their depth and sustainability. Without them, the individual risks feeling isolated. Assuming that a person resolves this crisis in favor of intimacy, he or she then faces a crisis about '''generativity and stagnation'''. This crisis is characteristic of middle-age in adulthood, and not surprisingly therefore is about caring for or making a contribution to society, and especially to its younger generation. It is about making life productive and creative—making it matter to others. An obvious way for some to achieve this feeling is by raising children, but there are many other ways as well to contribute to the welfare of others. The final crisis is about '''integrity and despair''', and is characteristic of individuals as they approach the end of their lives. At this point a person is likely to review the past and ask whether it has been lived as well as possible, even if it was clearly not lived perfectly. Since a personal history can no longer be altered at the end of a person’s life, it is important to feel at peace with it and to forgive oneself and others for any apparent mistakes that have been made. The alternative is despair, or depression from believing that not only was one’s life lived badly, but also that there is no longer any hope of correcting or making up for past mistakes.

Even though Erikson conceives of these crises as primarily concerns of adulthood, there are hints of them during the school years. Intimacy, for example, is a concern of many children and youth in that they often desire, but do not always find close, lasting relationships with others (Beidel, 2005; Zimbardo &amp; Radl, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Beidel, B. (2005). ''Childhood anxiety disorders.'' Oxford, UK: Brunner-Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, P. &amp; Radl, S. (1999). ''The shy child: Overcoming and preventing shyness from birth to adulthood.'' Cambridge, MA: Malor Books&lt;/ref&gt;. Personal isolation is a particular risk for students with disabilities (as I discuss in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs|Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs]], as well as for students whose cultural or racial backgrounds differ from classmates’ or the teacher’s (see [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 4: Student Diversity|Chapter 4: Student Diversity]]). Generativity—feeling helpful to others, and especially to the young—is needed not only by many adults, but also by many youngsters; when given the opportunity as part of their school program, they frequently welcome a chance to be of  authentic service to others as part of their school programs (Eyler &amp; Giles, 1999; Kay, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Eyler, J. &amp; Giles, D. (1999). ''Where's the service learning?'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay, C. (2003). ''The complete guide to service learning.'' New York: Free Spirit Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;. And integrity—taking responsibility for your personal past, “warts and all”—is often a felt need for anyone, young or old, who has lived long enough to have past experiences to look back on. Even children and youth have a past in this sense, though their pasts are of course shorter than older persons’.

===Abraham Maslow: A Hierarchy of Motives and Needs===

'''Abraham Maslow''' formulated a theory that portrays personal needs or motives as a hierarchy, meaning that basic or “lower-level” needs have to be satisfied before higher-level needs become important or motivating (1976, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1976). ''The further reaches of human nature.'' New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1987). ''Motivation and personality, 3rd edition.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;. Compared to the stage models of Piaget and Erikson, Maslow’s hierarchy is only loosely “developmental.” Maslow was not especially concerned with tracking universal changes across long spans of time (like all of childhood or the entire lifespan). Like Piaget and Erikson, though, he was concerned with the sequence or order in which changes occur, regardless of a person’s age, and in particular in the sequence in which needs are felt as motivations. Like the theories of Piaget and Erikson, as well, Maslow’s is a rather broad “story,” one that has little to say about possible effects of a person’s culture, language, or economic level.

In its original version, Maslow’s theory distinguishes two types of needs, called deficit needs (or deficiency needs) and being needs (or growth needs). [[Figure 3-2]] summarizes the two levels and their sublevels. The deficit needs are “prior” to the being needs, not in the developmental sense of happening earlier in life, but simply in the hierarchical sense that deficit needs must be satisfied first before being needs can be addressed. As I point out below, deficit needs can reappear at any age, in which case they must be satisfied again before a person’s attention can shift back to “higher” needs. Among students, in fact, deficit needs are likely to return chronically to those whose families lack economic or social resources or who live with the associated stresses of poverty (Payne, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Payne, R. (2005). ''A framework for understanding poverty.'' Highlands, TX: aha!Process, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.
        
====Deficit Needs: Getting the Basic Necessities of Life====

Deficit needs are the basic requirements of physical and emotional well-being. The most basic are physiological needs—food, sleep, clothing, and the like. Without these, nothing else matters, and especially nothing very “elevated” or self-fulfilling. A student who is not getting enough to eat, for example, is not going to feel thirst for knowledge! Once physiological needs are met, however, safety and security needs become important. The person looks for stability and protection, and welcomes a bit of structure and limits in life. At this level, a person is less concerned with immediate physical survival and more focused on the fear that survival may not continue. In school, a student motivated by safety and security may appreciate a well-organized classroom that insures personal safety and predictability, even if the classroom provides little else.

After physiological and safety needs are met, love and belonging needs emerge. The person turns attention to making friends, being a friend, and cultivating positive personal relationships in general. In the classroom, a student at this level may seek  more approval than usual from peers or teachers. They may be well provided for materially and find their classrooms and families safe enough, but still be missing a key ingredient in their lives, love. Assuming that such a student (or anyone else) eventually does find love and belonging, however, his or her motivation shifts again, this time to esteem needs. Now the concern is with gaining recognition and respect from others—and even more importantly, gaining self-respect. A student at this level of motivation may be unusually concerned with achievement, for example, though only if the achievement is visible or public enough to earn recognition from others.

====Being Needs: Becoming the Best That You Can Be====

Being needs are the desire to become fulfilled as a person, or to be the best person that you can possibly be. They include cognitive needs (a desire for knowledge and understanding), aesthetic needs (an appreciation of beauty and order), and most importantly self-actualization needs (a desire for fulfillment of one’s potential). Such needs emerge only after all of a person’s deficit needs have been met, at least in large part. Unlike deficit needs, being needs beget more being needs; that is, they do not disappear once they are met, but create a desire for even more satisfaction of the same needs. A thirst for knowledge, for example, leads to further thirst for knowledge, and aesthetic appreciation leads to more aesthetic appreciation. Partly because being needs are lasting and permanent once they appear, Maslow sometimes treated them as less hierarchical than deficit needs, and instead grouped cognitive, aesthetic, and self-actualization needs into the single category self-actualization needs. 

People who are motivated by self-actualization have a variety of positive qualities, and Maslow went to some lengths to identify and describe those individuals by analyzing information about them, both through published documents of their lives and through personal interviews and contacts[3]. Self-actualizing individuals, he argued, value deep personal relationships with others, but also value solitude; they have a sense of humor, but not one used against others; they accept themselves as well as others; they are spontaneous, humble, creative, and ethical. In short, the self-actualizing person has just about every good quality imaginable! Not surprisingly, therefore, Maslow felt that true self-actualization is rare, and especially infrequent among young people.

In a way this is discouraging news for teachers, who apparently must spend their lives providing as best they can for individuals—students—still immersed in deficit needs. Teachers, it seems, have little hope of ever witnessing fully fledged being needs, at least in their workplace. Taken a bit less literally, though, Maslow’s hierarchy can still be a useful for thinking about students’ motives clearly. Most teachers would argue that students—as young as they are—do sometimes display positive qualities similar to the ones described in Maslow’s self-actualizing person. However annoying students may sometimes be, there are also moments when they show care and respect for others, for example, as well as spontaneity, humility, or a sound ethical sense. This reality makes self-actualization an appropriate way to think about the best in students—their best motivations. At the same time, as I already mentioned, students frequently also show signs of various deficit needs. Keeping in mind the entire hierarchy outlined by Maslow can therefore make us more humane as professionals and more effective as classroom instructors.

==Moral Development: Forming a Sense of Rights and Responsibilities==
'''Morality''' is a system of beliefs about ethics, about what is right and good compared to what is wrong or bad. '''Moral development''' refers to the changes in moral beliefs as a person grows older and gains maturity....[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development/Moral Development|(read more...)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Main parts of the text are now posted. Here is what remains:

1. All tables and figures.

2. More links, both within the chapter, across chapters, and to relevant Wikipedia articles.

3. Check on referencing syntax. There has got to be a way to make this go faster.

4. End matter.

Only ten more chapters to go!

== How To Install ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Gadget Instructions 2|Whiteknight's Book Creator|ff2=yes|ff3=yes|ie7=yes|ie6=yes|safari=maybe}}

== About This Gadget ==

This gadget helps in the initial stages of designing a book. You type in the title of the book and you list the pages that will appear in the book's TOC. When you click &quot;'''Design'''&quot;, the gadget will automatically create the wikitext code for your new book TOC. 

=== Specifying Pages ===

To list the pages that are going to be in your new book, click the &quot;'''Show'''&quot; button to display the page list window. List the pages that you want to be in your book, one per line. At any time you may press the &quot;'''Hide'''&quot; button to hide the page list window, but preserve it's contents. Pressing the &quot;'''Clear'''&quot; button will completely remove all pages listed in the window.

=== Grouping Pages into Sections ===

To create a section sub-heading in your TOC, type an equal sign ('''='''), followed by the title of the section. For instance, typing the following code:

 A
 =B
 C
 D
 =E

Will produce the following result:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 [[My Book/A|A]]
 === B ===
 [[My Book/C|C]]
 [[My Book/D|D]]
 === E ===
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Specifying a Preface ===

To provide a preface for your new book, click &quot;'''Show'''&quot; to display the page list edit window. Once the window is open, type a percent sign('''%'''), followed by the text of the preface. Each line specified in this manner will be separated in the preface by two newlines, making it a new paragraph.

=== Adding Templates === 

Standard templates can be added using the &quot;+&quot; syntax. Prerequisite templates can be added using &quot;&amp;&quot;.

=== Adding Subjects ===

You can automatically add your book to certain subjects using &quot;-&quot;.



=== Designing the Book ===

When you have specified the book name, the page list, and the preface, you may click the &quot;'''Design'''&quot; button. The design process generated the wikitext necessary to produce your new book, but does not automatically save it nor display it. 

To view the text, along with a series of notes about how to implement it, click the &quot;'''Display'''&quot; button. This will show the generated wikitext on the left, and show helpful notes on the right. 

To create the new book, click the &quot;'''Edit'''&quot; button. This will display a standard edit window where the generated wikitext is already loaded. Modify the text as necessary, and click &quot;Save page&quot;. This will create your new book. '''Note''': If you have the categorization extension installed, in the edit window there will appear a drop-down box for categorization. Select the appropriate subject from the drop-down box and click &quot;'''Categorize'''&quot; to apply the necessary templates to your book. Once these templates have been properly added, click &quot;Save page&quot; as usual.

=== Creating a Nav Template ===

The Book Designer Gadget can also be used to design a page-header template, for use on every page in the book. A page header template helps to standardize the &quot;look and feel&quot; of all the pages in the book, along with providing navigation links, and placing book pages into the appropriate categories. The gadget uses pre-made header template from [[User:Whiteknight/Book Foundry#Header Templates|Whiteknight's Book Foundry]]. There are several options, and the documentation for all templates is available [[User:Whiteknight/Book Foundry#Header Templates|on the respective template pages]]. 

Once you have entered a valid book name and clicked the &quot;'''Design'''&quot; button, you are given the option to design a template. Select the appropriate template from the drop-down list, and click the &quot;'''Template'''&quot; button. This will display the text of the template, along with some helpful tips. You cannot directly edit or save the template text using the Book Designer Gadget.

Once you have created the template, make sure you include it at the top of every page in your new book, including the TOC.

=== Saving an Outline ===

If you are working on an outline, you can save it and continue working on it later. Enter a valid title in the book title box, click '''Show''' to show the list box, and click '''Save'''. This will display an edit window that will enable you to save your outline into a subpage of your user namespace. For instance, if you are User:JoeUser, and you enter a title &quot;My Book&quot;, the outline will be saved at &quot;User:JoeUser/My Book&quot;. 

When you save an outline, the outline is time-stamped and appended to the bottom of the page. This means that you can save multiple versions of the outline to a single page, and select later which one to use. 

=== Loading an Outline ===

You can load an outline from another wiki page, such as an outline that has been saved previously by the Book Designer Gadget, or another outline that was created manually. To load an existing outline, click '''Show''' to display the list box. Enter the name of the page into the input box in the lower-left corner, and click '''Load'''. This will load the complete current wikitext of that page into the list box. 

If the page you are loading has multiple saved outlines on it, you will need to delete any outlines that you are not planning to use. 

To help remove excess formatting, click the '''Strip''' button. This will remove some, but not all formatting from the page. You may still need to remove some formatting manually. 

=== Leaving Comments ===

You can leave comments in your outline using two forward slashes:

 //this is a comment. 

Text in a comment will not appear in your book or in your navigational template. However, comments will be included if you save your outline. This can be useful for making notes to yourself for when you come back to finish the outline.

&quot;We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us, this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.&quot; -Franklin D. Roosevelt
	
 
The Roosevelt administration stretched from 1933 to 1945, during which the 
United States faced many challenges, both at home and abroad. Without the leadership of President Roosevelt, America might not have come out of the Great Depression for many years, and a different president's policies could have changed the direction of World War Two, even the events from before America entered the war. Franklin Roosevelt is widely known for leading this country out of hard times and into a brighter future.
	
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born in Hyde Park, New York, on January 30, 1882, to James and Sara Roosevelt. He was an only child. Both of his parents came from wealthy old families; he was a distant relative of President James Monroe and his mother's family could trace their ancestry back to the Mayflower. He grew up in a privileged household and went to Harvard and Columbia Law School. In college, he met his wife Eleanor Roosevelt, who was then-President Theodore Roosevelt's niece and a distant relative of Franklin's at a White House reception. They got married on March 17, 1905, and had six children. 
	
Franklin Roosevelt had a long political career. In 1910, he was elected to the New York state Senate as a Democrat. He was reelected in 1912, but resigned to become the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He was appointed by the newly elected President Woodrow Wilson. During his time in office, he worked to expand the Navy. He also founded the Naval Reserve. World War one was going on during this time, and after the war ended in 1918, Roosevelt was put in charge of demobilization. He did not like the Versailles Treaty, which was signed after the end of the war, and coincidentally, he would have to deal with the consequences of the one-sided agreement as President. In 1920 he ran for Vice President alongside James Cox, but the Democrats lost. Roosevelt took a break from politics after that.
	
In 1921, Roosevelt was diagnosed with polio and became paralyzed from the waist down. But he never let this disability stand in his way. He was never seen in a wheelchair in public. He worked hard to teach himself to walk a short distance while using leg braces and a cane. After he became president, he helped to found the organization now known as the March of Dimes, which today is dedicated to improving the health of babies, but back then was dedicated to finding a cure for polio. 
	
In 1929, Roosevelt rejoined the political world and ran for Governor of New York. He won and became a reform Governor, starting social programs and investigating corruption. He was advised by Frances Perkins and Harry Hopkins, both of whom later would work for him in the White House, Hopkins as federal relief administrator, and Perkins as the Secretary of Labor. She was the first woman to hold a position in the President's Cabinet and kept that job during the entire administration. The same year he was elected Governor, the stock market crashed and the world was thrown into the Great Depression. 
	
Roosevelt's popularity made him a good candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1932. He built a coalition made up of the working class, organized labor, and minorities. He ran with John Garner, one of his supporters, as his Vice President. Garner stayed until 1941, followed by Henry Wallace until 1945 and Harry Truman for the final year. He easily defeated incumbent Herbert Hoover, who many voters blamed for the economic mess.
	
As soon as Roosevelt was inaugurated, he got to work repairing the economy. Prompted by widespread bank failures that wiped out people's savings, within the first year he created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which helps protect people's money in banks.  He also expanded the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. This agency tried to lower unemployment by hiring people to do work for the government. He created the Public Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration, both of which were used to build public works like bridges and parks. These programs were called the New Deal. 
	
Roosevelt also pushed for the repeal of Prohibition. The 21st Amendment was ratified in 1933, overturning the 18th Amendment, which banned the sale of alcohol in the United States. In the 1934 midterms, large Democratic majorities were elected to both chambers of Congress. After the elections, Roosevelt pushed though more new legislation for the New Deal. During this time he passed Social Security and the National Labor Relations Act, which gave blue-collar Americans more equality when negotiating contracts with management. Similar to presidential politics today, Roosevelt's opponents often called him a socialist, a communist, and other names, none of which made much sense.
	
During Roosevelt's second term in office, which began in 1937, World War Two began in Europe and Asia. The war began in 1939 with Germany invading Poland, then joining forces with Italy and Japan to form the Axis Powers. As Europe's democracies fell, most Americans wanted to stay out of the war, still remembering the tragedies of the First World War. Roosevelt wanted to intervene by helping Great Britain and France. He tried to convince Congress to send aid to these countries, leading to my opening quote. In March 1941, the Lend-Lease bill was passed, sending aid to Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China. The majority of the aid went to Britain. The bill, ironically, was numbered HR 1776. 
	
On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and America entered World War Two on the Allied side. The public's feelings about the war turned 180 degrees as Americans rallied around Roosevelt. Many were inspired by this line from his famous speech the next day declaring war on Japan:  &quot;Yesterday, December 7, 1941 — a date which will live in infamy — the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.&quot;
	
The Allies fought hard, and in 1943 the Allied leaders began to discuss what to do after the war. They met in Tehran and Cairo to plan the future of the world. In 1945, Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in Yalta. At this point, the Soviet Union had gained control of much of Eastern Europe. Roosevelt wanted the Soviets to help with the war in Japan, but another important item on the list was Poland. Stalin promised the other two leaders that &quot;the Soviet Union is interested in the creation of a mighty, free and independent Poland.&quot; This was a blatant lie. Roosevelt later admitted he had been overly optimistic about the Soviet dictator's actions.  After the war, many eastern European countries ended up as communist dictatorships until the Soviet Union began to crumble in 1989. 
	
The World War Two would end in August 1945, after America dropped atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but Roosevelt would not live to see victory. On April 12, 1945, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage while sitting for a portrait. He was buried at the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park. Harry Truman then became President and when Germany surrendered to the Allies in May 1945, President Truman dedicated the victory celebrations to Roosevelt's memory.</text>

==INTRODUCTION==
Teaching

	The Bahá’í writings praise education and its influence. They also praise and offer guidance for the art of teaching.

How wonderful will it be if the teachers are faithful, attracted, and assured, educated, and refined Bahá’ís, well grounded in the science of pedagogy, and familiar with child psychology. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1918)

Your niece's profession in training and educating children is one that will give her rich reward, because she is aiding in the development of the characters of the youth of today, who will become the ones who will guide humanity tomorrow. If they could be guided both materially and spiritually, then it would be a great victory, because after the world goes through its present travail, spiritual values will predominate; and those youth who have the benefit of both material and spiritual education will be the true leaders of society. (Effendi, cited in Rost, 1969, p. 167)

	Teachers can help to develop the student's higher levels of understanding rather than concentrate on dispensing and retrieving facts. They can arrange the student's environment so that learning and development occur and potential is released.

People today seem to be very superficial in their thinking, and it would seem as if the educational systems in use are sorely lacking in ability to produce a mature mind in a person who has reached supposedly adult life! All the outside influences that surround the individual seem to have an intensely distracting effect, and it is a hard job to get the average person to do any deep thinking or even a little meditation on the problems facing him and the world at large. (1948, p. 2)

The Bahá’í writings use many analogies to help understand complex situations. They refer to a child as a plant, and the educator as the gardener. As the conditions for each plant to thrive differ, so do the conditions of each person, and a good gardener or educator is aware of the needs of the plants and acts accordingly. 

These children are the plants of Thine orchard, the flowers of Thy meadow, the roses of Thy garden. Let Thy rain fall upon them; let Thy Sun of Reality shine upon them with Thy love. Let Thy breeze refresh them in order that they may be trained, grow and develop and appear in the utmost beauty. (Bahá’u’lláh, The Bab, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1970, p. 16-17)

	If every plant were subjected to the same conditions, some plants might grow well, some fair and some poorly. This condition exists in most classrooms today. Just as there are no two kinds of flowers exactly alike, there are no two children exactly alike. All flowers require certain basics for life and growth and some desire similar growing conditions, but if you subject an African violet to the same conditions that you would a rose, hoping it will become like a rose, you will not only not get a rose, but you will not even get a very healthy African violet. Each flower has a potential that is not necessarily better or worse, but different from the others. Each has value and plays a part in the creative plan of the garden. The soil is tilled by tests and perseverance, and the &quot;weeds of ignorance, thorns of superstitions and thistles of imitations,” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971, p. 76) cast aside. The fruit is knowledge and wisdom.
	The Bahá’í literature gives guidance on meeting the needs of all children, identifies the problems that must be dealt with, abolishes the idea that one child is intrinsically better than another, and establishes the framework for the education of children. The teacher should identify the particular learning needs of each child and the conditions and methods to help each grow. Those needs change as the children become more refined and their environments differ.
	A teacher must diagnose and prescribe the proper course of action for his students. There are certain basics that all people require, but each has individual needs that also must be met. The teacher must set and enforce healthy standards for development.
	There is much controversy today about the way children should be grouped for learning. Some maintain that learning is best when those of similar abilities and interests are grouped together, while others claim that learning is improved through heterogeneous grouping. The Bahá’í teachings stress the value of unity in diversity.

The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, cited in Shoghi Effendi, 1969)

	Much prejudice and harm are propagated by keeping different peoples separated from one another. People labeled slow or somehow inferior to others suffer in opportunity and self-concept. If schools do not take an active role in breaking down these destructive patterns, then change will be more painful and improvement slowed. Research has shown that ability grouping is often detrimental to development. It not only hampers effective growth, but also discriminates against children from low socioeconomic and minority groups. There is a place in schools and society for the concept of ability grouping, but if this practice leads to unfair discrimination or furthers prejudice of any kind, it should not be continued.
	Bahá’u’lláh identifies reward and punishment as the twin pillars on which the structure of world stability and order is sustained (1971, p. 219). It is also the process where the child develops positive and negative feelings about attitudes and behaviors. Over time, value systems develop which can guide the child to a happy and productive life. Without the proper rewards and punishments, many children will grow into adults with confused lives, no goals and little meaning. The responsibility for training children to develop healthy values is very important, and its neglect is a cause of the breakdown of our social order in this day.
	Both reward and punishment are needed to uphold the structure; one without the other will not hold it. We are coming from a tradition of using punitive measures to keep and develop order. Punishment without encouragement and an indication of what ought to be done, or reward and praise given indiscriminately without a standard, are not effective. Praise and rewards judiciously given, are more effective than punishment.

The children who are at the head of their class must receive premiums. They must be encouraged and when one of them shows good advancement, for their further developments they must be praised and encouraged therein. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1916, p. 142)

	Punishment is more effective when it is just and discharged in the spirit of love. Therefore, it is important to administer a punishment before you become vengeful. Shoghi Effendi writes about the need for discipline, the nature of children, and the goal of every education. 

With regard to the statement attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and which you have quoted in your letter regarding a &quot;problem child&quot;; these statements of the master, however, true in their substance, should never be given a literal interpretation. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá could have never meant that a child should be left to himself entirely free. In fact Bahá’í education, just like any other system of education is based on the assumption that there are certain natural deficiencies in every child, no matter how gifted, which his educators, whether his parents, school masters, or his spiritual guides and receptors to endeavor to remedy. Discipline of sort, whether physical or moral, or intellectual, is indeed indispensable, and no training can be said to be complete and fruitful if it disregards this element. The child when born is far from being perfect. It is not only helpless but actually imperfect, and even is naturally inclined towards evil. He should be trained so his natural inclinations harmonized, adjusted and controlled, and if necessary suppressed or regulated, so as to insure his healthy physical and moral development. Bahá’í's parents cannot simply adopt an attitude of non-resistance towards their children, particularly those who are unruly and violent by nature. It is not even sufficient that they should pray on their behalf. Rather they should endeavor to inculcate, gently and patiently, in their youthful minds such principles and teachings of the cause with such tactful and loving care as would enable them to become &quot;true sons of God&quot; and develop into loyal and intelligent citizens of His Kingdom.  This is the high purpose which Bahá'u'lláh himself has clearly defined as the chief goal of every education. (Cited in Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, 1977, p. 65-66)

	Both good and bad exist in people, but if left on their own, the lower nature will triumph. Only through training and effort can the higher nature become dominant. Teachers can assist the higher nature in its development by enabling success in this area, raising levels of aspiration and encouraging healthier self-concepts to children.

If a pupil is told that his intelligence is less than his fellow pupils, it is a very great drawback and handicap to his progress. He must be encouraged to advance, by the statement, &quot;you are most capable and if you endeavor you will attain the highest degree.&quot; (‘Abdu’l-Bahá 1930, p. 533-5)

Methods of Instruction
	What method of instructing students is most effective for learning? The Bahá’í writings mention several forms of instruction directly and others indirectly.

Lectures are very essential for they give a wonderful picture of the subject matter. But it is not sufficient to have a picture; the friends should deepen their knowledge and this can be achieved if, together with the lectures, there are study classes and seminar work carried on by the same lecturer. (Shoghi Effendi, 1932, p. 3-4)

God has given man the eye of investigation by which he may see and recognize truth. He has endowed man with ears that he may discover things for himself. This is his endowment and equipment for the investigation of reality. Man is not intended to see through the eyes of another, hear through another's ears nor comprehend with another's brain. Each human creature has individual endowment, power and responsibility in the creative plan of God. Therefore, depend on your own reason and judgement and adhere to the outcome of your own investigation; otherwise, you will be bitterly submerged in the sea of ignorance and deprived of all the bounties of God. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971, p. 75-76)

	Shoghi Effendi also supports the use of workshops (1949, p. 2 ) and encourages the use of meditation.

Through meditation doors of deeper knowledge and inspiration may be opened. (1948a, p. 3)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá talks about the value of speech and questioning.

Most ideas must be taught through speech, not by book-learning. One child must question the other concerning those things and the other child must give the answer. In this way - they will make great progress. For example, mathematics must also be taught in the form of questions and answers. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1918)

	Many teachers use this approach with great success. Both the questioner and the one questioned learn quickly from this method and each student is given the needed individual attention and helped to develop responsibility and knowledge.
	Example is a potent factor in teaching. Children learn what they live, especially in the development of values and attitudes. If a good example is absent in the learning environment, development will be hampered. It is important that one &quot;know his own self, and know those things which lead to loftiness or to baseness, to shame or to honor, to affluence or poverty,&quot; (Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971).
	‘Abdu’l-Bahá identifies four criteria for the acquisition of knowledge: 1. senses, 2. intellect or reason, 3. traditional or scriptural criterion, and 4. inspiration. He states that all available human criteria are erroneous and defective, but that by using all four together one could be more sure his findings were correct (1922, p. 48-9).
	Fear has been abused in our society and classrooms, but it does not mean that it cannot be a valuable element in education. Fear is a negative word in our society, but it has a positive value. We all operate on fear and should recognize and use this knowledge for our betterment, not our destruction.

The fear of God hath ever been the prime factor in the education of His creatures. (1969, p. 27)

c. utmost discipline and order: SWAB:#111, 137

d. if child is in school with heedless ones, take him away for they will try

	1) for punishment use means based on reason, even slight verbal chastisement if necessary but not permissible to strike or vilify a child: SWAB:#95, 125
	2) not permissible to strike or vilify a child; blows or verbal abuse will totally pervert a child's character: SWAB:#95, 125

g. If a pupil is told that his intelligence is less than his fellow pupils, it is a very great drawback and handicap to his progress. He must be encouraged to advance by the statement, 'You are the most capable, and if you endeavor, you will attain the highest degree': PUP:76-77
	1) child must not be oppressed or censured because it is undeveloped; it must be patiently trained: PUP:180-181
	2) must not be warped and hindered in its development. The ignorant must not be restricted by censure and criticism: PUP:40

h.  The Manifestation of God is a perfect example of real obedience. Like him we must sacrifice every thing, every plan, every longing and ideal must be given up completely to the will of God. We must look to God for all we desire, all we wish to attain. The will of God must work out its purpose in us. Our human will must be laid down in sacrifice and love.  Abdul-Baha has given everything in sacrifice and obedience to the will of God… All our soul powers, our outward self, our inward self must be consecrated to God in service and sacrifice.  Even life must be given if necessary.  If we have not reached this station of nothingness we have not attained to real obedience to the will of God. A pupil must submit entirely to the will of the teacher. This is true sacrifice, true obedience.  Real obedience and real sacrifice are identical, they are absolute readiness to follow and, perform whatever you are called upon to do in the Cause of God.  When you really love God you will be willing to sacrifice everything and submit yourself entirely to His will. Consecrate yourself wholly to Him. His will is everything. His service is paramount. 
(Words of ‘Abdul-Baha: Ten Days in the Light of Acca, p. 48; in SW VIII:6, p. 60)

	1) Every parent who is a believer in the Blessed Beauty has the responsibility to conduct herself or himself in such a way as to elicit the spontaneous obedience to parents to which the Teachings attach so high a value. 	(The Universal House of Justice, Ridvan 157, 2000, p. 9)

	2) In any case, the House of Justice points out that parents are responsible for their children and should make them behave when they attend Bahá'í meetings. If children persist in creating a disturbance they should be taken out of the meeting. This is not merely necessary to ensure the properly dignified conduct of Bahá'í meetings but is an aspect of the training of children in courtesy, consideration for others, reverence, and obedience to their parents. (14 October 1982 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada; in The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 447; Lights of Guidance, #506, p. 151)

	3) The parents have the inescapable duty to educate their children -- but not vice versa; the children have the duty to obey their parents -- the parents do not obey the children…(From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand, December 28, 1980; in Lights of Guidance, #730, p. 218; The Compilation of Compilations, vol. I, p. 413; vol. II, p. 384)

	4) &quot;The parents must exert every effort to rear their offspring to be religious, for should the children not attain this greatest of adornments, they will not obey their parents, which in a certain sense means that they will not obey God. Indeed, such children will show no consideration to anyone, and will do exactly as they please.&quot; (Bahá'u'lláh: Bahá'í Education, a compilation of the Universal House of Justice; in Lights of Guidance, #763, p. 228; cited in letter of the Universal House of Justice to the Persian believers, dated March 1997)

	5)&quot;We have enjoined upon every son to serve his father. Thus have We decreed this command in the Book.&quot;  (Bahá'u'lláh: Family Life, a compilation of the Universal House of Justice; in Lights of Guidance, #764, p. 228)

	6)&quot;The father must always endeavour to educate his son and to acquaint him with the heavenly teachings. He must give advice and exhort him at all times, teach him praiseworthy conduct and character, enable him to receive training at school and to be instructed in such arts and sciences as are deemed useful and necessary. In brief, let him instill into his mind the virtues and perfections of the world of humanity. Above all he should continually call to his mind the remembrance of God so that this throbbing veins and arteries may pulsate with the love of God.
		&quot;The son, on the other hand, must show forth the utmost obedience towards his father, and should conduct himself as a humble and a lowly servant. Day and night he should seek diligently to ensure the comfort and welfare of his loving father and to secure his good-pleasure. He must forgo his own rest and enjoyment and constantly strive to bring gladness to the hearts of his father and mother, that thereby he may attain the good-pleasure of the Almighty and be graciously aided by the hosts of the unseen.&quot;  (‘Abdu’l-Baha, in Family Life, a compilation of the Universal House of Justice; in Lights of Guidance, #766, p. 229)

	7)&quot;If thou wouldst show kindness and consideration to thy parents so that they may fell generally pleased, this would also please Me, for parents must be highly respected and it is essential that they feel content, provided they deter thee not from gaining access to the Threshold of the Almighty, nor keep thee back from walking in the way of the Kingdom. Indeed it behoveth them to encourage and spur thee on in this direction.&quot;  (‘Abdu’l-Baha, in Family Life, a compilation of the Universal House of Justice; in Lights of Guidance, #767, p. 228)

	8)&quot;We have caused to return to thy home as a token of Our Mercy unto thy mother, inasmuch as We found her overwhelmed with sorrow. We have enjoined you in the Book 'to worship no one but God and to show kindness to your parents'.&quot;[ Qur'án 46:15] Thus hath the one true God spoken and the decree hath been fulfilled by the Almighty, the All-Wise. Therefore We have caused thee to return unto her and unto thy sister, that your mother's eyes may thereby be cheered, and she may be of the thankful.
		&quot;Say, O My people! Show honour to your parents and pay homage to them. This will cause blessings to descend upon you from the clouds of the bounty of your Lord, the Exalted, the Great.
		&quot;When We learned of her sadness, We directed thee to return unto her, as a token of mercy unto thee from Our presence, and as an admonishment for others.   
		&quot;Beware lest ye commit that which would sadden the hearts of your fathers and mothers. Follow ye the path of Truth which indeed is a straight path. Should anyone give you a choice between the opportunity to render a service to Me and a service to them, choose ye to serve them, and let such service be a path leading you to Me. This is My exhortation and command unto thee. Observe therefore that which thy Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious,hath prescribed unto thee.&quot;  (Bahá'u'lláh, in Family Life, a compilation of the Universal House of Justice; in Lights of Guidance, #768, p. 229-230)

	9) &quot;It is often difficult for us to do things because they are so very different from what we are used to, not because the thing itself is particularly difficult. With you, and indeed most Bahá'ís, who are now, as adults, accepting this glorious Faith, no doubt some of the ordinances, like fasting and daily prayer, are hard to understand and obey at first. But we must always think that these things are given to all men for a thousand years to come. For Bahá'í children who see these things  practiced in the home, they will be as natural and necessary a thing as going to church on Sunday was to the more pious generation of Christians. Bahá'u'lláh would not have given us these things if they would not greatly benefit us, and, like children who are sensible enough to realize their father is wise and does what is good for them, we must accept to obey these ordinances even though at first we may not see any need for them. As we obey them we will gradually come to see in ourselves the benefits they confer.&quot;  (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, March 16, 1949; in Lights of Guidance, #1150, pp. 342-343)

== INTRODUCTION ==

Child Development

‘Abdu’l-Bahá likens the growth of a child to that of a sapling. If it becomes crooked, it will be affected the rest of its life. The training received in the early years greatly influences development; therefore, the education of mothers and their first teachers is of utmost importance.

The education of woman is more necessary and important than that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy. If she be defective and imperfect herself the child will necessarily be deficient; therefore, imperfection of woman implies a condition of imperfection in all mankind, for it is the mother who rears, matures, and guides the growth of the child. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1972, p. 29)

The first trainer of the child is the mother. The babe, like unto a green and tender branch, will grow according to the way it is trained. If the training be right, it will grow right, and if crooked, the growth likewise, and unto the end of life it will conduct itself accordingly. Hence, it is firmly established that an untrained and uneducated daughter, on becoming a mother, will be the prime factor in the deprivation, ignorance, negligence, and the lack of training of many children . . . endeavor with heart, with life, to train your children, especially the daughters. No excuse is acceptable in this matter. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1930, p. 580)

	An emphasis on early education is supported by these statements. The importance of equipping parents with the proper knowledge and skills for such a long lasting and vital responsibility is clear. The Bahá’í writings contain extensive guidance on child development which is supported by research.
	‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that individual differences are the result of inherited and acquired innate character. Inherited qualities are those physical and mental characteristics that one acquires genetically from his parents. The greatest influence and the one teachers can most affect is acquired character, which formal or informal education is the primary force. Innate differences are inborn characteristics unique to that person that explains why children from the same family with similar genetic and environmental influences have different capacities (Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971, p. 318-20). The varieties of human qualities result from differences of degrees in these areas of character. 

Difference of capacity in human individuals is fundamental . . . Bahá’u’lláh has revealed principles and laws which will accomplish the adjustment of varying human capacities. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971, p. 37)

	Bahá’u’lláh identifies knowing and loving as our two most important potentialities and the foundation for realizing all others. All must independently apply reason to what they see and hear, and not blindly accept what is presented to them. Each person's capacities and responsibilities to the creative whole are different and important. People consist of body, mind, and spirit. These three areas determine individual needs and development. The three elements necessary for change are corollaries of these three areas.

The attainment of any object is conditioned upon knowledge, volition, and action, unless these three conditions be forthcoming there is no execution or accomplishment. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971, p. 10)

	Educators are concerned with all three areas, generally called the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. The Bahá’í teachings contain ideas that are helpful in all three areas, relating to such things as using of reward and punishment, concentrating on the positive, developing high expectations and developing volition.

Success or failure, gain or loss, must, therefore, depend upon man's own exertions. The more he striveth, the greater will be his progress. (Bahá’u’lláh, 1971, p. 81-2)

Unto each one hath been prescribed a preordained measure, as decreed in God's mighty and guarded Tablets. All that which ye potentially possess can, however, be manifested only as a result of your own volition. (Bahá’u’lláh, 1971, p. 149)

	Teachers can encourage their students to develop their own volition. The importance given to acquiring an education is an important factor in motivating students. Such things as setting goals and developing perseverance and self discipline will improve development. When values are in tune with reality, knowledge is the means to honor, prosperity, joy, gladness, happiness, and exultation, and its acquisition will become more desirable and easily obtained (Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1971). Lofty ideals and service improve volition. Schools must be actively involved with translating what is learned into reality and action. In this way, the true value of a learning will be realized. Service is the goal or result of action.
	Tests are often viewed negatively, but they are important for growth physically, mentally, and spiritually. Tests make us aware of our present condition and offer opportunities to develop new strengths. Traditionally examinations in schools have been used to compare students to others. The Bahá’í writings recognize the value of competition, but maintain that each person has individual differences that should be the cause of beauty and development, not standards of good and bad. Therefore, exams are not important for comparing students with one another, but for helping students become aware of their present abilities so they can further develop their potential. 
	Physical, mental, or spiritual education should help us to go beyond our present state and develop new physical, mental, or spiritual awareness and strength. Life creates such situations daily, but many people do not take advantage of them. Students need a balance, with more successes than failures. When educators give exams with the idea of developing awareness, and releasing potential according to each individual's capabilities, then much growth can result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">XI. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

==INTRODUCTION==
Educational Administration

The role of the administration is to translate purpose into collective action. The Bahá’í writings contain principles relevant to educational administration that can be used to improve the management of education and identify the variables necessary for successful collective life. Much of the current literature on effective administration and organizations supports the principles enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh in the nineteenth century. When groups understand these principles, value these qualities and strive to practice them in their various communities, they can cause meaningful improvements. Bahá’í communities serve as models of the effectiveness and practical application of these principles. The Bahá’í Local Spiritual Assembly, the primary administrative institution in Bahá’í communities, can serve as a model for the administration of a school community. The principles and guidelines for the Local Spiritual Assembly and the individuals in the community being administered are applicable.		
Shoghi Effendi, the authorized interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s work after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, describes the role of the Local Spiritual Assembly and its relationship to the individual.	
	
You should turn to your local Assembly in the strictest confidence, and seek their aid and advice. These bodies have the sacred obligation to help, advise, protect, and guide the believers in every way within their power when appealed to - indeed they were established just for the purpose of keeping order and unity and obedience to the law of God amongst the believers. You should go to them as a child would to its parents. (1941, p. 16)	

This structure requires certain responsibilities from both the administration and those being administered and is contrary to the spirit existing in many systems. Today there is a general disrespect for those in authority. This results partly because those in authority do not deserve the respect, partly because of tradition and culture, and partly because leaders are acceptable scapegoats. Bahá’u’lláh (1971) and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1969) state that those in authority must earn this respect by administering with justice. Without some consultation, justice and unity, little constructive change can occur. 
The administration of a school creates the structure and governance for the school community. It is important for it to have a sound and effective philosophy of operation. The Bahá’í administration contains certain elements found in the three existing forms of government without “any of the objectionable features which they inherently possess” (Shoghi Effendi 1955, p. 152-3).
 
A purely democratic system depends on getting its mandate from the people and the participation of the governed. This approach is not efficient or practical as it requires lengthy discussions, decision-making, and knowledge that is not readily available to all involved. Bahá’í administration requires that those in authority must &quot;acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for themselves the right of an unfettered decision.&quot; (1955, p. 153)	
An autocratic or aristocratic system is efficient, but conditions now require that the rights and responsibilities of all be safeguarded. There must be basic decisions agreed upon by all involved. The rights of all must be upheld. Corruption, bureaucratic tendencies and dictatorial authority generally found in these systems hamper proper functioning.
Bahá’í administration is based on a decision-making process called consultation. It is a powerful tool that can be used to make sound, agreeable decisions and to improve the schools. The purpose of consultation is to find the truth of a matter, not to vaunt one person's opinions over another's. The Bahá’í writings contain extensive guidance on consultation.

Show forbearance and benevolence and love to one another. Should anyone among you be 	incapable of grasping a certain truth, or be striving to comprehend it, show forth, when conversing with him, a spirit of extreme kindness and good-will. Help him to see and recognize the truth, without esteeming yourself to be, in the least, superior to him, or to be possessed of greater endowments. (Bahá’u’lláh 1971, p. 8)
	
The members thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should anyone oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must prevail. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Cited in Shoghi Effendi, 1968, p. 21-2)	

	The clash of differing opinions is necessary, not the clash of personalities which causes ill-feeling and discord. Problems should be dealt with by looking at our own faults and not others, not in confrontation. Consultation also involves the sacrifice of opinions as Shoghi Effendi clearly states in a letter about spiritual assemblies.	

We all have a right to our opinions, we are bound to think differently - but a Bahá’í must accept the majority decisions of his assembly realizing that acceptance and harmony - even if a mistake has been made - are the really important things . . .  It is better if they submit to the majority view and make it unanimous. But they are not forced to. What they must do, however, is to abide by the majority decision, as this is what becomes effective. They must not go around undermining the assembly by saying they disagreed with the majority. In other words, they must put the cause first and not their own opinions. He can ask the assembly to reconsider a matter, but he has no right to force them or create in harmony because they won't change. Unanimous votes are preferable, but certainly cannot be forced upon assembly members by artificial methods such as are used by other societies. (1947, p. 3)	

Books have been written on the principles and methods of consultation found in the Bahá’í writings (Kolstoe, 1985; Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, 1980). The principle that a group of people working together is more effective than a group of individuals working alone is not a new one. The research relating to group theory verifies the value of consultation.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá likens the family to a nation and explains the conditions necessary for proper functioning (1971, p. 100). This analogy can be applied to our schools. When any member of the school family recognizes some disunity or negative factors within the setting, a concerted effort must be put forth to remedy the situation. The strife and dissension existing in many schools today are harmful to the well-being of students and faculty.

==Review of Literature==

Besides the many volumes of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844-1921), Shoghi Effendi (1896-1957), and the Universal House of Justice (1963-), several other publications by Bahá’ís and Bahá’í institutions may be consulted as sources for Baha'i education. Several documents are presently available presenting Bahá’í ideas on education to various agencies and audiences, i.e., [[Bahá’í Education]] (Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, August 1976),  &lt;u&gt;Position Statement on Education&lt;/u&gt; (Bahá’í International Community Task Force on Education, January 1989), &lt;u&gt;Education for a New Namibia&lt;/u&gt; (NSA of Namibia, August 1990), &lt;u&gt;Educational Policy: A Bahá’í Perspective&lt;/u&gt; (NSA of India, November 1985), and “Charter for Bahá’í Schools” (American Bahá’í, April 1990).

Other eminent researchers and educators include G. Marks, A. Jones, H. Danesh, I. Ayam, D. Troxel, D. Allen, M. Smith, H. Hanson, J. Hatcher, I. Taafaki, R. Johnson, W. Diehl, N. Rutstein, C. Miller, G. Eyford, W. Hatcher, E. Muttart (Canada), S. Waite, H. Rost, P. Lample, F. Arbab, H. Nikjoo, S. Vickers, P. Christensen, E. Anello, J. Savi, E. Tinto, M. Higgins and L. Nuguchi.

== Transforming Complex XML Documents ==

XQuery has many features that allow you to transform XML and create full document-style transformation libraries.  Unlike traditional &quot;database&quot; documents, complex XML documents have &quot;complex content&quot; that includes in-line elements in unpredictable order.  This section provides a foundation for these transformations based on using the XQuery typeswitch functions. Typeswitch function transformations replace XSLT transforms but can also access indexes for very fast transforms of large collections.  {{stage short|50%|Nov 29th, 2010}}

== Paginated Reports ==
Unlike HTML pages, paginated reports use the concept of text flows between pages.  These examples show you how to convert raw XML into high-quality PDF files suitable for printing.  The examples use a markup standard called XSL-FO for &quot;Formatted Objects&quot;

== Love ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Love plays a much bigger role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] downfall than he or Harry realize.  Regardless of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt's]] intentions for her son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] grew up an anonymous child in an orphanage, without the unconditional love or care he would have received from his mother. Whether or not this lack of love in his life shaped him at an early age, it is certainly true that, by the time [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] met him at eleven, he was already showing sociopathic qualities.  

Riddle's inability to comprehend love, or the purity of it, kept him from making any real friends.  When he meets his father and grandparents at 16, he does not attempt a relationship or any sort of reconciliation.  Instead, he murders them all and uses their deaths to create a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes|Horcrux]]. 

Perhaps it is the lack of love in his early life, coupled with the missing pieces of his soul relegated to Horcruxes, that further renders him incapable of understanding love's impact.  When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] approached [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and asked him to spare [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]], Voldemort did make an attempt to do so. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] limited recollections of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|night his parents were killed]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|the memories of that night]] that Harry later receives from Voldemort, agree that Voldemort had commanded Lily to stand aside so that he could gain access to Harry.  However, spurred on by her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|husband's]] death as well as her maternal instincts for her child, Lily refused, and Voldemort killed her before turning his attention to Harry. 

It is Voldemort's intent to kill Lily if she gets between him and Harry, that turns Snape against Voldemort, and leads to his defection to Dumbledore and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters|Order of the Phoenix]]. Learning of Voldemort's plan to kill Harry, with the associated grave risk to Lily, Snape pleads with Dumbledore to protect her, and promises &quot;anything&quot; if Dumbledore will do so. Dumbledore requires Snape to turn informant against Voldemort. Lily's subsequent death at Voldemort's hands does not end the promise, and Snape remains an ally of Dumbledore's until his death. When Harry comes to school at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Dumbledore adds covertly ensuring Harry's safety to Snape's mission.  Despite Snape's overt animosity toward Harry, probably in part caused by Harry's extremely close resemblance to James, the older man never forgets whose child Harry is, and feels duty-bound to watch over Lily's son because he loved her so much.  Snape's work as a double agent allows him to pass along information about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] to the Order of the Phoenix and thwart certain parts of Voldemort's plans.  If Lily Potter hadn't been killed, Voldemort would still have had a loyal servant in Snape and Harry might have been successfully killed long ago.

It should also be noted that throughout the seventh book, Harry receives valuable information about Voldemort's actions and plans by means of the soul shard of Voldemort's that is resident in Harry. Voldemort is unable to reverse this flow of information, because of the extreme distaste he has formulated for the inside of Harry's mind. What drove Voldemort permanently out of Harry's mind was Harry's longing to be with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] again. Dumbledore had commented at the time that he believed Voldemort had found Harry's mind a very uncomfortable place to be, and that he was not surprised that Harry had had no intimations of Voldemort's presence in his mind throughout the sixth book.

The fact that Voldemort can’t feel or understand love, but that Harry can, is also very important. It is because Harry can feel love that he can reciprocate, and it is this reciprocation of love that allows Harry to be surrounded by those who will assist him in his ventures, most notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Voldemort can’t feel or understand love, so those who choose to follow him do so purely for their own selfish motives, coupled perhaps with fear of what Voldemort would do to them if they went against his will. It is this same lack of understanding that blinds Voldemort to the possibility that by failing to spare Lily, he could lose his follower Snape, and this lack of ability to reciprocate love that frees Snape to act against Voldemort covertly. When Voldemort has proven by his actions that he does not care about Snape's feelings, Snape in turn feels that he is free to seek whatever help he can find to protect Lily, and the help he finds is Dumbledore. On the other hand, while Ron is unhappy enough with Harry's progress to leave him, we never think that he would be able to betray Harry. We have commented elsewhere that Harry has friends while Voldemort has followers; Harry's friends stay with him because they believe in him and his mission and want to help him, and because of this, their motivation is much stronger than those who follow Voldemort.

This is not to say that Voldemort does not know how to use love as a weapon. In one instance we are aware of, Voldemort's Death Eaters kidnap [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] in order to pressure [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|her father]] into changing the editorial tone of his newspaper, and incidentally almost manage to capture Harry by that means. Being unable to see the strength that derives from love, Voldemort likely only sees this vulnerability, and thus believes himself stronger for having nobody that he cares about.

== Death ==

Death has played a central role in each book, and is at the heart of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|final confrontation]] between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Both Horcruxes, which form the main thrust of the entire series, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], which are a major part of the story of the seventh book, are shown to be means of avoiding or mastering death.

Practically since birth, Voldemort has been attempting to discover the path to immortality.  During his time at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] learns about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Before he is sixteen, Riddle has realized that the only way to create a Horcrux is through the murder of another, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 23|as we learn]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. This scene is meant to give the appearance that Tom is learning about Horcruxes from Slughorn, but in fact, as he is already wearing the Gaunt ring at this point, he has already made his first Horcrux. As Voldemort’s greatest fear is death, he thinks nothing of killing others to save himself later on, and creates his first Horcrux through the death of Tom Riddle, his own father. Voldemort spends the next several years of his life creating Horcruxes so that when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Avada Kedavra]] curse backfires on him, he doesn’t succumb to death.

In direct contrast to Voldemort’s desperate attempts to avoid death are the examples of sacrificial death.  Both [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] surrender to death to save their son. During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 9|First Wizarding War]], many members of the Order of the Phoenix were killed trying to stop Voldemort’s rise to power. Several characters are also killed throughout the books, many of whom give up their lives to save others. While those fighting on Voldemort’s side are willing to do almost anything to stay alive, those with the Order of the Phoenix, such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], understand that their lives may be needed for their cause and are willing to give them up.

Harry’s attitude toward death is usually shown as a balance between recklessness and respect. While looking into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], Harry is able to see the Philosopher’s Stone and retrieve it because he did not seek to use it to prolong his life. Though we don't learn this until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|the final book in the series]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|duel in the cemetery]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Harry is actually the stronger wizard because he is prepared for death, while Voldemort fears it. Many times, Harry’s actions have led to his being in a dangerous situation, yet he has faced death bravely. When he finally works through the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|riddle engraved on the Snitch]], &quot;I open at the close,&quot; he realizes that the Snitch can only be opened as he is facing his death. Using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 22|Resurrection Stone]] Dumbledore placed inside, Harry recalls his loved ones temporarily from death, and from their company gains the courage to face Voldemort and his own death.  It is his ability to willingly die to destroy Voldemort’s seventh Horcrux that actually allows him to survive. Following [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville’s]] beheading of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes|Nagini]], Voldemort is no longer mortally protected, and so his last, backfiring, attempt to kill Harry results in his own final demise.

== Family ==

Through the lens of family, the differences between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] are reinforced.  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone'']] begins with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|Harry’s being placed with his aunt and uncle following his parent’s death.]]  He never feels welcomed by his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|mother’s sister]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|her family]] and is treated as a second-class citizen.  Contrasting that, Harry finds a place with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|his family.]]  Almost immediately upon meeting Harry, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley show him love and affection and include him in their family.  Harry ends up relying on this surrogate family for guidance and support.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] also grew up as an orphan: though his father was still alive, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 13|Tom was raised in an orphanage.]]  Unlike Harry, however, Riddle never got a taste of what unconditional love was like, and never learned to trust others.  

Harry’s experience with the Dursleys was apparently no better than Riddle’s time in the orphanage, though by watching the Dursleys' son Dudley and how the parents reacted to him, he was able to see directly what unconditional love could be like. One must wonder whether actually seeing the evidence of the existence of that sort of love would make the absence of it easier or harder to bear, though its absence must be made somewhat less painful by the apparent result it had on Dudley, making him self-centered and horrendously over-indulged.  Yet, despite their similarly loveless &quot;home&quot; environments, Harry became a strong, moral member of the Wizarding World, while Riddle became Voldemort.  Perhaps Harry’s parents passed on to their son favorable qualities that he could draw upon in times of personal struggle.  Harry idealized his parents, while Voldemort looked upon his with disdain, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 17|killing his father]] as soon as he discovered who he was.

      <comment>/* Using Subsequence to Limit Results */ Improper word for context</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
Sometimes you have many records or instances in a collection and you want to limit the amount of data returned by a query.

= Strategy =

== Limiting Records in a Document ==
If you are limiting records in a large XML document you can do this by adding a predicate to the end of your for loop:

&lt;code&gt;
for $person in doc($file)/Person[position() lt 10]
&lt;/code&gt;

== Using Subsequence to Limit Results ==

The following query retrieves only the first 10 documents, in sequential document order, contained within a collection.

   for $person in subsequence(collection($my-collection)/person, 1, 10)

Where:

   subsequence($sequence, $starting-item, $number-of-items)

Note that the first argument is the item to start at and the second is the total number of items to return.  It is NOT the last item to return.

== Sorting Before Limiting Results ==

Note that usually you will want to get the first N documents based on some sorting criteria, for example people that have a last name that start with the letter &quot;A&quot;.  So the first thing you must do is create a list of nodes that have the correct order and then get the first N records from that list.  This can usually be done by creating a temporary sequence of sorted items as a separate FLWOR expression.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $sorted-people :=
   for $person in collection($collection)/person
   order by $person/last-name/text()
   return $person

for $person at $count in subsequence($sorted-people, $start, $records)
return
   &lt;li&gt;$person/last-name/text()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Adding Buttons to Get Next N Records ==

== Getting the Next N Rows ==
After you fetch the first N items from your sequence you frequently want to get the next N rows. To do this you will need to add buttons to your report for &quot;Previous N Records&quot; and &quot;Next N Records&quot;.  Thse buttons will pass parameters to your XQuery telling where to start and how many records to fetch.

To do this you will need to call your own script with different parameters on the URL.  To keep track of the URL you can use the get-url() function that comes with eXist.  For example:
&lt;code&gt;
let $query-base := request:get-url()
&lt;/code&gt;
If your query was run from '''http:/localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/apps/user-manager/views/list-people.xq''' this is the string that would be returned.

We will also get two parameters from the URL for the record to start at and the number of records to fetch:

&lt;code&gt;
   let $start := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;start&quot;, &quot;1&quot;))
   let $num := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;num&quot;, &quot;20&quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;

Now we will create two HTML buttons that allow us to get next N records or the previous N records.

&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onClick=&quot;parent.location='{$query-base}?start={$start - $num}&amp;amp;num={$num}'&quot; value=&quot;&amp;lt; Previous&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onClick=&quot;parent.location='{$query-base}?start={$start + $num}&amp;amp;num={$num}'&quot; value=&quot;Next &amp;gt;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Full Example Program ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;
declare namespace u=&quot;http://niem.gov/niem/universal/1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;indent=yes&quot;;

let $start := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;start&quot;, &quot;1&quot;))
let $num := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;num&quot;, &quot;5&quot;))
let $query-base := request:get-url()

return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Contacts&lt;/title&gt; 
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Contacts&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
         &lt;thead&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;Last Name&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;First&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;Street&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;City&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;State&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;Zip&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;EMail&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th&gt;Phone&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;/thead&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to create reports that work with industry standard portals.  These systems have standard div tags with class attributes that are standardized.

For example the searchbox for a page will have the following XHTML:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;portal-searchbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Method ==
We will create a report that is structured as a set of divs with the appropriate class tags.  We can then take the URL for this report and add it to the portal management system.  Our report will automatically be styled according to the central portal style sheet.

Portal software allows
These divs need to be filled by XQueries:
* portal-wrapper
* portal-top
* portal-header
* portal-breadcrumbs
* portal-searchbox
* portal-advanced-search
* portal-footer
* portal-colophon
* portal-personaltools

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
Sometimes you need to be able to manipulate the URI of your own XQuery.  This is useful when you need to call your own XQuery with different parameters.  For example if you have an XQuery that returns the first 20 rows in a query but you want to add a '''Get Next 20 Records''' button you may want to simply call yourself with additional parameters for what record to start with, in this case start at record 21.

This program demonstrates some XQuery functions that are not part of the original XQuery specification but are required for precise web server XQuery functionality. 

The functions are:
* [[/eXist/]] '''request:get-uri()''' - Returns the URI of the current request within the web server.  For example
&lt;code&gt;/exist/rest/db/test/my-query.xq&lt;/code&gt;
* [[/eXist/]] '''request:get-url()''' - Returns the full URL including the server and port.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com:8080/exist/rest/db/test/my-query.xq&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* [[/eXist/]] request:get-query-string() - Returns the full query string passed to the servlet (without the initial question mark).
* [[/eXist/]] system:get-module-load-path() - returns the path to the place where a module has been loaded from
* [[/eXist/]] system:get-exist-home() - returns the base of the eXist web root

=Sample Program=
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace system=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/system&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $get-uri := request:get-uri()
let $get-url := request:get-url()
let $module-load-path := system:get-module-load-path()
let $exist-home := system:get-exist-home()
let $path := substring-after($module-load-path, 'xmldb:exist://embedded-eXist-server')
let $replace := replace($module-load-path, 'xmldb:exist://embedded-eXist-server', '')

return

= Beat Mashery =

This page is for gathering the information from [http://www.native-instruments.com/forum_us/showthread.php?p=325606 this thread] on the Reaktor Forums and for documenting the planning and implementation of beat mashing / editing tools.

== Ideas and Inspiration ==

The [http://www.fxpansion.com/index.php?page=4 GURU] drum machine has some nice editing features, such as click / drag to create a row of hits with up / down dragging changing the timing of the hits (8ths , 16ths etc..) then if the SHIFT key is held down, up / down dragging can create velocity fades.

== Instruments ==

Dave Pape suggested working on 3 components that each handle a major part of the process

# Break Slicer
# Chop-player (Sequencer)
# Sample-player

=== Break Slicer ===

Automatic slicer using threshold with user control for slice points.

Creates map across keyboard for use in the sample player

* Single Hits
* Processed single hits : Need to define a set of processes, tag which hits are interesting
* Break Sections

For the processed hits section maybe look at how to generate them as .wav / .aiff files as well.

=== Sequencer ===

Something like an event table containing blocks of MIDI data: rolls, filter sweeps etc

* Automatic layout of all hits from the sample map
* Each row can have a different quantize setting which is easy to adjust while editing
* Keyboard modifiers for preset and custom row patterns

==== Row Patterns ====

Have a set of predefined patterns and custom patterns. Hold down key (or select from list) to activate pattern, mouse click inserts selected pattern at cursor position.

Maybe have option for 'wrap pattern' so that patterns that go off the right edge wrap back to the start.

==== Controller Data ====

Preset lanes for controllers like cutoff, pitch shift. Ideally allow adding custom lanes to control anything, see the [http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=userlibrary&amp;type=0&amp;ulbr=1&amp;plview=detail&amp;patchid=6278 EVENT BUS] from the user lib.

=== Sample Player ===

Sample-based instrument containing a sample map made from the output of the Break Slicer. Plays MIDI from the sequencer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is how my copy of Dreamweaver MX links CSS files:

&amp;lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--&lt;br&gt;
@import url(relativeURL);&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;

Is this not technically valid according to web standards? I ask because it is not included in this book. If it is valid, then I think that it should be included.
Or is this not even the right place to ask this? [[User:GovernmentMan|GovernmentMan]] 10:33, 11 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hi - can I make you aware that Wikibooks does not host source texts and it appear that you are currently creating that.  You might be better looking at [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikisource] where such material is more appropriate - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:25, 11 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

An &lt;u&gt;STC&lt;/u&gt; file, or &lt;u&gt;ST&lt;/u&gt;ar &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;atalog, specifies the position and other parameters of a Star or Barycenter.

This is a brief description of the STC parameters recognized by Celestia v1.4.1 and newer versions of the program. STC functionality has undergone a substantial improvement when compared to the previous versions of Celestia, v1.3.2 and earlier.

==List of parameters==
* Barycenter
* Star
** OrbitBarycenter
or
** RA
** Dec
** Distance

** AppMag or AbsMag
** SpectralType
** Radius (optional; the default value is calculated from the Star's SpectralType and magnitude.)
** SemiAxes or Mesh (optional)
** Texture (optional)
** EllipticalOrbit (optional)
*** Orbital elements (not listed here: see [[Celestia/SSC_File#EllipticalOrbit_.7B_...parameters..._.7D | SSC documentation]]) 
** Rotational elements (not listed here: see [[Celestia/SSC_File#EllipticalOrbit_.7B_...parameters..._.7D | SSC documentation]]; optional)

==Description==

===Type and Identifier===

* '''Barycenter''' or '''Star''' 
* ''&lt;number&gt;''
* &quot;''&lt;name&gt;'' : ''&lt;name&gt;''&quot;


An STC catalog file can be used to describe either '''Stars''' or '''Barycenters''' around which '''Stars, Barycenters''' and SSC objects can orbit.

A '''Barycenter''' defines only a position in space. You can't see it. It's the center of mass of a collection of bodies. A '''Barycenter''' can orbit around another '''Barycenter''' or around a '''Star'''.

A '''Star''' is a glowing object described by a position plus visual parameters like '''SpectralType''', '''AppMag''' or '''AbsMag''' and optional '''Mesh''', '''Radius''', '''SemiAxes''' and '''Texture''' declarations. A '''Star''' can orbit around another '''Star''' or around a '''Barycenter'''.

There are three optional fields used to introduce an STC object. They specify the type of object it is and provide unique identifiers for it. In their required order of appearance, they are
* (Optional) type of object: either '''Barycenter''' or '''Star'''. If omitted, '''Star''' is assumed.
* (Optional) Hipparcos catalog number: if this Hipparcos catalog number is the same as the Hipparcos catalog number of a previously existing Star or Barycenter, that object is replaced by this one. Barycenters and Stars can replace each other or objects of the same type.
* (Optional) quoted name: can be a list separated by colons (:). This will replace the names of a previously defined object with the same catalog number. If no name is specified, the original names will be retained. 

Of the three, at least a HIP number or a Star name is required.

Examples:
* Type of object, Hipparcos catalog number, and two names

            Barycenter 100000 &quot;My Barycenter:My System&quot; { ... description ... }

* Name of object (type of object is assumed to be Star)

            &quot;My Star&quot; { ... description ... }
All of the other parameters used to describe a particular STC object are enclosed within curly-brackets: { }

====Bayer Star Names====

When a Bayer star name is specified, the 3-character abbreviation for the Greek letter as used in the Hipparcos catalog should be specified. These abbreviations are
    alpha = ALF   beta= BET   gamma= GAM   delta= DEL   epsilon= EPS
    zeta  = ZET   eta = ETA   theta= THE   iota = IOT   kappa  = KAP
    lambda= LAM   mu  = MU.   nu   = NU.   xi   = KSI   omicron= OMI
    pi    = PI.   rho = RHO   sigma= SIG   tau  = TAU   upsilon= UPS
    phi   = PHI   chi = CHI   psi  = PSI   omega= OMD

e.g.

 Star &quot;ALF Cen&quot; { ...description... }

This table is taken from
&lt;i&gt;HD-DM-GC-HR-HIP-Bayer-Flamsteed Cross Index&lt;/i&gt;
Kostjuk N.D., 
Institute of Astronomy of Russian Academy of Sciences (2002),
which is available at
http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?IV/27

====Constellation Names====

Similarly, when specifying a constellation name as part of a star's name, use its official 3 letter abbreviation. The [http://www.iau.org/ International Astronomical Union] provides a list of  [http://www.iau.org/CONSTELLATIONS.241.0.html constellation abbreviations].

----

===Position===

* '''RA''' 
* '''Dec''' 
* '''Distance'''

or
* '''OrbitBarycenter'''
* SSC-style '''EllipticalOrbit''' parameters (optional)


The nominal location of a Star or Barycenter can be specified using either RA, Dec and Distance or by using the keyword OrbitBarycenter to specify the name (and thus the position) of a previously defined '''Barycenter''' or '''Star'''.

For example:

      RA 299.0    # in fractional degrees, 0-360
      Dec -10.5   # in fractional degrees, -90 to + 90
      Distance 30 # in light years

or

      OrbitBarycenter &quot;My Star&quot;

Note that in an STC catalog, '''RA''' must be specified in degrees. This is unlike a [[Celestia/DSC_File|DSC catalog]], where '''RA''' must be specified in hours.

* A '''Star''' or '''Barycenter''' can orbit around its own nominal position, around another '''Star''' or around a '''Barycenter'''.

:The orbit of a '''Star''' or '''Barycenter''' is specified using the same '''EllipticalOrbit''' declaration as is used in [[Celestia/SSC File|SSC files]]. (A list of parameters is omitted: see the chapters on [[Celestia/SSC File|SSC files]] and [[Celestia/Trajectories|Trajectories]]. Celestia v1.5.0 Frame declarations are not yet supported in STC catalogs.)

:A '''Star's''' or '''Barycenter's''' elliptical orbit is defined relative to the object's nominal location, which is specified using either an '''RA''', '''Dec''', '''Distance''' triplet or by '''OrbitBarycenter'''.

Specifying '''RA,Dec,Distance''' is slightly more efficient than '''OrbitBarycenter''', but only at load time, when Celestia has to lookup the position of the Barycenter. Despite this, OrbitBarycenter should be used for multi-star systems so that Celestia can determine that two stars orbiting the same point are actually associated.

===Appearance===

* '''SpectralType''' ''&quot;string&quot;''
* '''AbsMag''' ''f'' or '''AppMag''' ''f''

* '''Radius''' ''f'' (optional) 
* '''SemiAxes''' [''f'' ''f'' ''f''] (optional)
* '''Mesh''' &lt;''filename''&gt; (optional)
* '''Texture''' &lt;''filename''&gt; (optional)

* SSC-style orientation parameters (optional)


* By default, the appearance of a '''Star''' is controlled by its '''SpectralType''' (coloration) and magnitude (brightness: either '''AbsMag''' or '''AppMag'''). Celestia's spectral type field can include any of the standard astronomical spectral type and luminosity codes. See below for a description of the magnitude standard used by Celestia.

* The size of a Star is usually calculated from its SpectralType and its Magnitude. Optionally one can force a Star to be a particular size by specifying its '''Radius''' in km.

* The default spherical shape of a Star can be modified by the optional declaration '''SemiAxes'''. '''SemiAxes''' specifies the relative sizes of a '''Star's''' radii in three dimensions:

      SemiAxes [1 0.85 1]

* The default spherical shape of a '''Star''' can be replaced by using the optional model declaration '''Mesh'''.
      Mesh &quot;accretion_disk.cmod&quot;

:A '''Mesh''' may be a 3DS model, or one of Celestia's proprietary model types, either CMOD or CMS, which are described [[Celestia/3D_Models|elsewhere]].

* The default surface texture of a '''Star''' (normally determined from its '''SpectralType''') can be replaced by using a '''Texture''' declaration
      Texture &quot;image filename&quot;
:Note: as of Celestia v1.4.0, only one default texture is used for all stars: astar.jpg. Its coloration is determined by the '''Star's''' '''SpectralType'''. 

* The orientation of a '''Star''' is controlled by the same optional rotational element declarations as are used in SSC catalogs, although v1.5.0's BodyFrames and related functions are not yet available. (A list of rotational parameters is available in the [[Celestia/SSC_File|SSC documentation]].) 

* Other SSC parameters are not supported. In particular, Bumpmaps, Normalmaps, NightTexture and Atmosphere (including CloudTextures) are ignored.

:Also, AltSurface and Location declarations are not (yet?) supported.

==Example STC definition==

This example is taken from Grant Hutchison's star catalog file Celetia/data/nearstars.stc. It's one of the catalogs which are included with Celestia v1.4.0 and later.

==Renaming Stars==

The following procedure can be used to change the names associated with a Star or Barycenter in Celestia.

* Create an STC catalog file using your favorite text editor.
* Specify the star's Hipparcos number.
* Enclose the replacement name(s) in quotes, separated by colons.
* Include the full location and stellar type information for the star. 

For example, this STC file (betel.stc) renames Betelgeuse:

 27989 &quot;Betelgeuse:Al Mankib:Almerzamo nnagied:Gula:Besn:ALF Ori:58 Ori&quot;
 {
  RA 88.792958
  Dec 7.407064
  Distance 419.13
  AppMag 0.58
  SpectralType &quot;M1Iab&quot;
 }

The alternative names above are from ''Star Names, Their Lore and Meaning'' by Richard Allen, Dover, 1963. The location and spectral information are from the [http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/sim-fid.pll Simbad catalog server].

==Visual magnitudes in Celestia==
by Fridger Schrempp.

In view of various different standards used to characterize (apparent) magnitudes, it might be worth specifying what Celestia actually wants:

In Celestia, AppMag corresponds to the so-called V-magnitude in the Johnson UBV photometric system!

Confusion may arise, since Celestia uses data from the Hipparcos catalog and that has introduced its own visual filter profile. The Hipparcos &quot;visual&quot; magnitude is called Hp.

This profile is much wider in wavelength than the &quot;standard&quot; Johnson one.

Moreover, Tycho data again use different photometry, designated with V_T and B_T for the visual and blue magnitudes, respectively.

There exist detailed mutual transformation algorithms and/or lookup tables. The relations are quite non-trivial in general.

For interested people, here is a good summary of transformations etc.: http://www.tass-survey.org/tass/catalogs/tycho.html

==Hipparcos and Tycho Catalog Numbers==

Celestia uses Hipparcos catalog numbers as the primary identifier for its Stars. Hipparcos catalog numbers, often identified in documents with the prefix HIP, range from 1 to 118218. In Celestia, Tycho catalog numbers start at 1 000 000 000.

Tycho catalog numbers can be used, but they have to be &quot;encoded&quot; into fake Hipparcos numbers. They all are encoded into a 10 digit number with a value greater than 1 000 000 000. To do this, the three numeric fields of a Tycho catalog number are reversed and concatenated into a single number:

      TYC aaaa-bbbbb-c becomes cbbbbbaaaa

E.g. TYC 654-32-1 becomes 1000320654.
(Note, however, that this number does not correspond to an actual Tycho catalog entry. It is only used to show how the numeric fields are rearranged.)

Celestia rearranges these numbers to display the correct Tycho catalog number on the screen.

The following STC catalog entry defines the star TYC 654-32-1 named &quot;TycStar&quot;

 1000320654 &quot;TycStar&quot;
 {
  RA 123.45
  Dec 45.67
  Distance 89
  SpectralType &quot;G1V&quot;
  AppMag 8.7
 }

Note that Celestia uses 32-bit integers to represent star numbers, so cannot use star numbers above 4294967295 (which would correspond to TYC 7295-29496-4): this should not limit the implementation of real Tycho stars.

I am a highly motivated teacher who belief in hands-on. I am passionate about language which has inspired me into becoming an English teacher. In addition to native Spanish, I speak English as a second language, Japanese, French, Portuguese, and a bit of Korean. I believe that the study of language not only gives you better job opportunities, but, also help you develop excellent communication skills, which are necessary in any career. I am currently doing a master's degree in Teaching English as a Second language, planning on studying translation and eventually a doctor's degree linguistics.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{useful}}

This world is full of thousands of languages. Wikibooks also hosts many different language learning books, but on a smaller scale, of course.

Becoming fluent in a language is no walk in the park, even if you do already display an aptitude for languages. This Wikibook will act as a very useful guide showing how difficult learning any particular language you have set your eyes on is.

Many people wonder how long it will take them to become proficient in a certain language. This question, of course, is impossible to answer because a lot depends on a person's language learning ability, motivation, learning environment, intensity of instruction, and prior experience in learning foreign languages. Last, but not least, it depends on the level of proficiency the person wishes to attain.

The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the US Department of State has compiled approximate learning expectations for a number of languages based on the length of time it takes to achieve Speaking 3: General Professional Proficiency in Speaking (S3) and Reading 3: General Professional Proficiency in Reading (R3). The list is limited to languages taught at the Foreign Service Institute, minus languages which don't have their own Wikibook. 
Note that this only states the views of The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the US Department of State, and many language learners and experts would disagree with the ranking. It must also be kept in mind that students at FSI are almost 40 years old, are native speakers of English and have a good aptitude for formal language study, plus knowledge of several other foreign languages. They study in small classes of no more than six. Their schedule calls for 25 hours of class per week with three or four hours per day of directed self-study.

Before you even look at the table, here's a little advice: If you find that the language you want to learn is particularly difficult, don't let that stop you from learning it. They may well be difficult, but that doesn't mean they're impossible to learn (and once you do learn it, it will be much more rewarding)! Also remember that the Foreign Service Institute may have gotten things wrong.


==Language difficulties==
Now for the part you've all been waiting for. &quot;How difficult will learning language ''x'' be?&quot;. Well, now you can find out what the FSI thinks.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20071014005901/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/november/learningExpectations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

After witnessing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s death, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] hears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s magically amplified voice, speaking to everyone at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and specifically to Harry, giving him one hour to surrender and threatening to kill everyone if he fails to comply. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] return to Hogwarts through the tunnel, and Ron and Hermione enter the Great Hall, where the defenders are regrouping and the many wounded and dead lie. Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] among the deceased. Unable to bear the sight, Harry runs to the Headmaster's office, where all the portraits stand empty, and finds Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]].

Harry pours Snape's memories into the Pensieve, and, hoping to briefly escape his own mind, enters the memories. He finds himself in a playground. A young, small boy, whom Harry recognizes as Snape, is watching two girls, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]], from behind a small bush. After Lily shows some strange tricks to her older sister, unaware she is performing magic, Snape emerges and informs Lily that she is a witch and derides Petunia as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]]. Insulted at being called a witch, Lily follows her indignant sister and goes away, leaving Snape bitterly disappointed. It is apparent he was planning this for a while and it all went wrong.

The scene dissolves and reforms into a new one. Snape is telling Lily about Hogwarts and magic, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. When Lily inquires about Snape's parents, he says that they are still arguing, revealing Snape's unhappy home life. When Petunia appears and insults Snape, a tree branch above breaks and falls on her. Accusing Snape of breaking the branch, Lily goes away, leaving him miserable and confused.

The scene changes into a different memory. Snape is standing on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]] next to a thin, sour-looking woman whom Harry recognizes as Snape's mother, Eileen Prince. Snape is staring at Lily's family. Petunia and Lily are arguing. Petunia calls Lily a freak for being a witch, and Lily retorts that Petunia had not thought so when she wrote to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], asking for admission to the school. An embarrassed Petunia, realizing that Lily and Snape read her letter, insults them, and they part on bad terms.

The scene reforms once more, and inside the Hogwarts Express, Snape finds a compartment with Lily and two boys. She is upset over her sister's hurtful words. Snape begins to say that Petunia is only a Muggle but instead grandly announces they are setting off for Hogwarts. When he mentions she had better be in Slytherin, one of the boys, the young [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], scornfully remarks to his friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] that he would rather leave than be in Slytherin, and prefers Gryffindor. Sirius points out that his entire family have been in Slytherin. Snape engages in a little battle of words with both Sirius and James, until an indignant Lily asks Snape to follow her to different compartment.

And the scene dissolves again into Hogwarts' Great Hall during the House sorting ceremony. Lily is sorted into Gryffindor, much to Snape's dismay. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], and James Potter are also sorted into Gryffindor, joining Sirius Black. Finally, Snape is sorted into Slytherin.  At the Slytherin table, he receives a pat on the back from a Prefect, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]].

The next scene depicts Lily and Snape arguing. Lily says they are still friends, though she detests whom Snape hangs out with, naming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mulciber|Mulciber]] specifically. Snape counters by mentioning the trouble James Potter and his friends cause and hints that Lupin is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. The fight is resolved and Snape is satisfied when Lily criticizes James as an &quot;arrogant toerag.&quot;

The scene switches for the sixth time and is the same memory Harry saw before when he peeked into Snape's Pensieve during their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] lessons. Harry keeps his distance somewhat, not caring to witness this memory again. It ends when he hears Snape shouting &quot;Mudblood&quot; at Lily.

The scene changes to night time in front of the Gryffindor Tower. Snape is remorseful for calling Lily a Mudblood and had threatened to sleep outside the entrance had she not come to see him. Despite his deep, desperate apologies, the angry Lily is fed up with Snape and will not forgive him, and disapproves of him having friends with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ambitions. She leaves him and the scene dissolves.

The scene takes longer to reform and now becomes a hilltop in the darkness. The adult Snape is panting and pacing and appears to be waiting for something. A jet of white light flies through the air and Snape, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmed]], drops to his knees. Dumbledore asks what message he has brought from Lord Voldemort. Snape replies with a request from himself. He admits he relayed everything he heard of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]] to Voldemort, and that Voldemort believes the chosen child is Lily's son. He reveals that Voldemort plans to hunt down and kill the entire family. Dumbledore is disgusted that Snape has asked Voldemort to spare only Lily's life without regard for her husband and son. Ashamed at being rebuked, Snape then pleads with Dumbledore to hide the entire family. Surprising Snape, Dumbledore asks him what he will give in return. After a long moment, Snape replies, &quot;Anything.&quot;

The scene switches to Dumbledore's office. Snape, grief-stricken, is slumped in a chair with a grim-looking Dumbledore standing over him. Snape asks why Dumbledore failed to keep Lily and her family safe. Dumbledore replies that they put their faith in the wrong person, much as Snape had in trusting Voldemort to spare Lily's life. He says that her son, Harry, survived. Snape wishes he were dead with Lily, and Dumbledore tells him that if he truly loved Lily, he will help protect Harry when Voldemort returns. Snape reluctantly agrees. He makes Dumbledore promise never to tell anyone that he is protecting James Potter's son, ever.

The scene shifts again and Snape is criticizing Harry to Dumbledore, saying he is like James Potter. Dumbledore replies that other teachers report Harry to be a modest, likable, and reasonably talented boy. He asks Snape to keep an eye on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]].

With a whirl of color everything changes again and Snape and Dumbledore are now standing in the entrance hall as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] is ending. Snape tells Dumbledore that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Mark]] is becoming darker as well and that he plans on fleeing if the Mark burns. When Dumbledore asks if Snape is tempted to do the same, Snape denies it and says he is not a coward. Dumbledore then muses that perhaps students are Sorted too soon, leaving Snape shocked.

The scene dissolves for the twelfth time and reforms into the headmaster's office again. Dumbledore is semiconscious, his right hand blackened and dangling over the side of the desk. Snape is muttering incantations and pouring a golden liquid down Dumbledore's throat. When Dumbledore regains consciousness, Snape asks why Dumbledore even tried on the ring. Dumbledore says he was a fool. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]]'s ring lies on the desk, cracked, with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] next to it. Snape says it is a miracle he got here and that the curse is extraordinary powerful. Snape believes Dumbledore may only have a year to live since all he can do is contain the curse, not stop it. Dumbledore replies that this makes things much easier to decide and begins discussing Voldemort's plan involving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] killing Dumbledore. Snape says it is only to punish the Malfoys and that Draco is expected to fail. Dumbledore correctly guesses that when Malfoy fails, Voldemort wants Snape to finish Dumbledore off, saying that Voldemort feels he will soon not need a spy at Hogwarts anymore, as it will be under his control. Dumbledore makes Snape promise to watch over the students in that event, and to be the one to kill him (Dumbledore). Snape questions this and Dumbledore says it would be helping an old man die. He would rather die on his own terms at the hands of Snape than foes like Death Eaters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]]. Snape reluctantly agrees and the scene ends.

In the next scene, Snape and Dumbledore are strolling through the castle grounds at night. Snape asks what Dumbledore has been doing with Harry all these evenings alone, and Dumbledore replies that he has information he must give to Harry before it is too late. Snape challenges Dumbledore as to why he is not entrusted with the same information, to which Dumbledore replies that he does not like to keep all his secrets in one basket. They get into a row about Snape having to be a double agent on Dumbledore's orders and that Harry is no more trustworthy than Snape. Dumbledore begins to go on with his plan to Snape, however, Snape is angry that Dumbledore refuses to tell him what he has told Harry and threatens that he has changed his mind about killing Dumbledore. Dumbledore reminds him that he gave him his word and that he is also to keep an eye on Draco. Snape looks unsatisfied so Dumbledore invites him to his office that night.

The scene shifts to Dumbledore's office. Dumbledore tells Snape that Harry must not know what he has to do until the final moment, and that after Dumbledore's death, there will come a time when Voldemort fears for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini's]] life. He instructs Snape that, if there is ever a time when Voldemort keeps Nagini magically protected and always in his sight, Snape must then tell Harry that he is a seventh [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], inadvertently created by Voldemort, and that Harry must die in order for Voldemort to be killed. Snape feels tricked, upset that Dumbledore made him protect Lily's son only to have him die. Dumbledore asks if Snape has grown to care for Harry, but Snape spurns that possibility and casts his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], a silver-white doe. Dumbledore, shocked, asks Snape, &quot;After all this time?&quot;, to which Snape says, &quot;Always.&quot;

The scene switches to Snape talking to Dumbledore's portrait. Dumbledore says Snape must give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure if Voldemort is to trust Snape. Snape is also to suggest the Potter decoys using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus]] so that Harry is indeed safe. 

The scene shifts to Snape face-to-face with Mundungus in a tavern. Snape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|confunds]] him so he will suggest using multiple Potters, and to forget seeing Snape or that he got the idea from him. 

The scene shifts yet again, to Snape gliding on a broomstick at night. Up ahead are Lupin and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George]], disguised as Harry. Snape casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] at a Death Eater to prevent him from Cursing Lupin, but the spell misses and hits George instead, severing his ear. 

The scene shifts again to Sirius's room at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. Snape is weeping as he reads Lily's letter to Sirius. He takes the second page containing Lily's signature, and tears out her image from the picture of her and Harry, then leaves. 

The scene shifts again and Snape is in the headmaster's office. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus']] portrait says Hermione and Harry are in the Forest of Dean. Dumbledore's portrait, appearing happy, tells Snape to plant the sword of Gryffindor there without being seen. Snape says he has a plan, removes the Sword from behind Dumbledore's portrait, and leaves.

Harry returns to himself, lying on the carpet in the same room he just saw Snape leaving.

== Analysis ==

It has been mentioned that Rowling is highly skilled at what is called the &quot;set-up and pay-off&quot; writing style. Here, we see a classic example. The preceding six books have created a long set-up, from as far back as the first novel when Snape was introduced, and on through the entire series as the conflict within Snape is repeatedly shown. While readers accept Harry's belief in Snape's untrustworthiness, evidence shows that Snape was protecting Harry since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 11|the first book]]. Here, we have the pay-off: it is revealed that Snape has been among Harry's staunchest protectors, despite his hating Harry's father, because he made a promise out of his love for Harry's mother. 

Snape's constant inner conflicts have helped make him an intriguing character. His love for Lily never faded, and, unknown to Harry, that is why Snape always protected him. Snape's seeming malice towards Harry actually resulted from Snape's lingering hatred and resentment towards James Potter; Harry was merely an unfortunate reminder and a convenient target. As Snape was about to die, he asked to gaze into Harry's eyes, presumably because they looked just like Lily's, something Harry has been repeatedly reminded of.

We additionally learn why Petunia despised Lily and, by extension, Lily's son Harry. Because she was born without any magical ability, Petunia hated magic and everything associated with the Wizarding realm. As Petunia had actually requested permission to attend Hogwarts, and had been declined, it is clear that her rejecting the magical world is simple jealousy and retaliation for it never accepting her, an all-too-human characteristic. We can surmise that she wed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Vernon Dursley]] because he possessed a so-very-stolid non-magical nature, and it is clear that the ill-treatment she inflicted on Harry was part and parcel of those same feelings.

Judging by the above, it can be seen that Snape and Petunia shared certain similarities in their personalities. Both were denied what they most desperately wanted, and each manifested their jealousy and disappointment as hatred toward Harry. In Petunia's case, her hatred was extended from her envy over her sister's magical abilities, while Snape was consumed with spite for James Potter and his pain over losing Lily. Petunia could never ever set aside these feelings and never ceased to hate Harry throughout his life. Snape, who also remained bitter about James Potter, carried forward this bitterness towards James's son Harry; this was not helped by Harry's own dislike and disrespect for Snape himself. However, Snape's outward attitude towards Harry also was a part of his mask which helped him remain trusted by Voldemort, who would have killed Snape instantly if he was seen to be protecting Harry.

There are many other revelations, large and small. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Petunia Dursley says, &quot;I heard – that awful boy – telling ''her'' about them – years ago.&quot; &quot;''Her''&quot; is of course Lily, her sister, and &quot;them&quot; refers to the Dementors, whom Petunia has just identified as the guards of Azkaban. It is interesting to note that &quot;that awful boy&quot; was actually Severus Snape. Knowing Petunia, we expected this to refer to James Potter.

Snape's memories show something else unexpected. Previously, Harry had seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|the memory after the Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. test]] in a chapter called &quot;Snape's Worst Memory.&quot; Considering the extreme humiliation Snape suffers at James Potter's hands, that would seem sufficient reason for it being his &quot;worst memory.&quot; However, knowing Snape's strong feelings for Lily, the memory acquires a different meaning: it is the worst because one word spoken in it forever ended his friendship with Lily Evans, who later married James Potter and gave birth to Harry.

While the reason is never explicitly given, it is clear that when Dumbledore, watching the students return from the Yule Ball, remarks that perhaps the students are Sorted too soon, Snape is shocked at the thought that his true place at Hogwarts as a boy, and his entire later life, could have been different had the Sorting been delayed until he better understood his own desires. 

The conversation between Snape and Dumbledore on the castle grounds, appearing as Snape's fourteenth memory, is one we have heard pieces of before. Apparently this discussion took place [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 19|the previous year]], just before Ron's rather disastrous birthday. It was partially overheard by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who, with his usual inability to keep a secret, passed on the bits he overheard to Harry and Hermione.

The following conversation, in Dumbledore's office, turns out to perhaps one of the most important revelations of the entire series. Dumbledore finally explains to Snape the reason why Harry has a connection with Voldemort, why Harry can see Voldemort's mind (and vice versa), and why Harry can speak to snakes. It turns out a part of Voldemort's soul attached to Harry when the curse rebounded, and it lived inside him ever since. Harry was the Horcrux that Voldemort did not intend to make, and unless Harry was killed, Voldemort would not be able to die. Snape is horrified upon learning about this, and shows a side of his character that we hadn't seen till now. He accuses Dumbledore of manipulating Harry's life, to raise him and protect him so that at the proper time Harry must voluntarily seek Voldemort and allow himself to be killed. When Dumbledore sees that Snape is so angry that Harry must die, he asks if Snape had grown to care about Harry. We learn that Snape is still in love with Lily, performing a Patronus which takes the shape of a doe, which we believe, and Dumbledore recognizes, is somehow reminiscent of Lily. From the shape of Snape's Patronus, the reader recognizes that it was actually Snape who placed the Sword of Gryffindor in the forest and guided Harry towards it; this is of course confirmed by the final scene in Snape's memories.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is interesting to note that of those around him, Dumbledore most often confided in Snape, whereas up until this chapter, Minerva McGonagall had always appeared to be his closest confidante. Before, Snape always seemed on the periphery and his true allegiance questionable. Now it is revealed that Dumbledore and Snape enjoyed a close relationship, forged by a common quest. When others asked why he trusted Snape, Dumbledore always alluded to a nebulous event, but never elaborated. Now, not only do we see what he was referring to—Snape's undying and unrequited love for Lily—but also why Dumbledore refused to identify it: Snape extracted that promise from him. Finally, we understand why Dumbledore trusted Snape implicitly, and vice versa, and our, and Harry's, faith in Dumbledore is reaffirmed.

Also noteworthy is that this chapter fully explains why Snape was so eager to see Sirius Black turned over to the Dementors, and why he retained his hatred for Sirius even after both realized they were on the same side. Sirius Black had been framed as an accessory to Lily's murder. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] shared the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] belief that Sirius betrayed Lily and James. Snape wanted revenge on Sirius for his lost love's murder. Even after Sirius' innocence was established, Snape continued to hate Sirius, though his lingering resentment over their antagonistic schooldays at Hogwarts likely also fueled his emotions. Snape may also have blamed Sirius for allowing James to trust Peter Pettigrew, so inadvertently causing Lily's death.

The key item that Harry takes away from this is the message that Dumbledore had required Snape to pass on to Harry: that Harry must allow himself to be killed in order that the last Horcrux be destroyed. It is, of course, critical to the story that Snape provide this entire set of memories to Harry. Snape had no time, and was wise enough to recognize Harry's deep distrust of Snape and his motives. Even if he had more time, Snape knew that he would be unlikely to convince Harry that Dumbledore wanted Harry to subject himself to Voldemort. Providing Snape's entire back story with Harry and his parents, in a way that was entirely trustworthy, no matter how uncomplimentary to Snape, is the only way that Harry would be able to accept the truth of Snape's allegiance. In fact, given Snape's ability as an Occlumens, it is only with Snape being ''in extremis'' that Harry is likely to accept these memories as being true. If Snape had not been in the final moments of his life, Harry would likely have distrusted Snape's memories as possibly being edited.

We must be careful about the wording here, of course; note that while Snape refers to the soul shard as a Horcrux, Dumbledore does not. This, it turns out, is critical to Harry's future; a Horcrux is magically bound to its container, and the container must be destroyed in order to destroy the Horcrux. The soul shard within Harry, while acting as a Horcrux in that it would anchor Voldemort's flayed soul to the earth, is not bound to Harry, but is simply clinging to him, and can be separated from Harry and destroyed by means that are less destructive to Harry.

However, Harry is too dismayed by the other implications of this conversation to discern such fine points; he has just learned that in order to finally defeat Voldemort, Harry must allow Voldemort to kill him. Given Voldemort's announcement at this chapter's beginning, Harry believes that the same magic that protected him after Lily's death may be invoked by his own death to protect Hogwarts' defenders from Voldemort. Even so, the awareness that he must allow Voldemort to murder him is almost more than he can bear.

While Harry is currently far too occupied with current events to be able to deal with the major revelations in this chapter, we will see that he does accept that Snape had been acting to protect him. In the Epilogue, we will learn that Harry had named his second son Albus Severus, after two headmasters of Hogwarts, and that he felt the one from Slytherin was one of the bravest men he had ever met.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Hemp also known as Cannabis has provided almost every single human society in history with many of its needs. The word &quot;canvas&quot; is derived from the Dutch pronunciation of the Greek  word &quot;Kannabis&quot;. Etymologists trace &quot;Kannabis&quot; traced back to the early Sumerian/Babylonian word ''&quot;K(a)N(a)B(a)&quot; '', one of the longest surviving root words in human language.

Generally, you will encounter functions expressed in explicit form, that is, in the form &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  To find the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'', you take the derivative with respect to ''x'' of both sides of the equation to get
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
But suppose you have a relation of the form &lt;math&gt;f(x,y(x))=g(x,y(x))&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, it may be inconvenient or even impossible to solve for ''y'' as a function of ''x''. A good example is the relation &lt;math&gt;y^2 + 2yx + 3 = 5x \,&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case you can utilize '''implicit differentiation''' to find the derivative. To do so, one takes the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to ''x'' and solves for &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[f(x,y(x))]=\frac{d}{dx}[g(x,y(x))]&lt;/math&gt;
and solve for ''dy/dx''.
You need to employ the chain rule whenever you take the derivative of a variable with respect to a different variable. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} (y^3) = \frac{d}{dy}[y^3]\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}=3y^2 \cdot y' \ &lt;/math&gt;

== Implicit Differentiation and the Chain Rule ==
To understand how implicit differentiation works and use it effectively it is important to recognize that the key idea is simply the chain rule.
First let's recall the chain rule.  Suppose we are given two differentiable functions ''f''(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') and that we are interested in computing the derivative of the function ''f''(''g''(''x'')), the the chain rule states that:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(g(x))\Big) = f'(g(x))\,g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
That is, we take the derivative of ''f'' as normal and then plug in ''g'', finally multiply the result by the derivative of ''g''.

Now suppose we want to differentiate a term like ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to ''x'' where we are thinking of ''y'' as a function of ''x'', so for the remainder of this calculation let's write it as ''y''(''x'') instead of just ''y''.  The term ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is just the composition of {{nowrap|1= ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and ''y''(''x'').  That is, {{nowrap|1= ''f''(''y''(''x'')) = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}.  Recalling that {{nowrap|1=''f''&amp;prime;(''x'') = 2''x''}} then the chain rule states that:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(y(x))\Big)=f'(y(x))\,y'(x)=2y(x)y'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Of course it is customary to think of ''y'' as being a function of ''x'' without always writing ''y''(''x''), so this calculation usually is just written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}y^2=2yy'.&lt;/math&gt;
Don't be confused by the fact that we don't yet know what ''y''&amp;prime; is, it is some function and often if we are differentiating two quantities that are equal it becomes possible to explicitly solve for ''y''&amp;prime; (as we will see in the examples below.)  This makes it a very powerful technique for taking derivatives.

== Explicit Differentiation ==
For example, suppose we are interested in the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'' where ''x'' and ''y'' are related by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered on the origin.  Note that ''y'' is not a function of ''x'' since it fails the [[Calculus/Functions#The_vertical_line_test|vertical line test]] (&lt;math&gt;y=\pm1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, for example).

To find ''y''', first we can separate variables to get 
:&lt;math&gt;y^2 = 1 - x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the square root of both sides we get two separate functions for ''y'': 
:&lt;math&gt;y = \pm \sqrt{1-x^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can rewrite this as a fractional power:
:&lt;math&gt;y = \pm (1-x^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule we get,
:&lt;math&gt;y' = \pm\frac{1}{2}(1-x^2)^{-1/2}\cdot(-2x) = \pm\frac{x}{(1-x^2)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

And simplifying by substituting ''y'' back into this equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;y' = -\frac{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

== Implicit Differentiation ==
Using the same equation
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

First, differentiate with respect to ''x'' on both sides of the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + y^2] = \frac{d}{dx}[1]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[x^2]+\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

To differentiate the second term on the left hand side of the equation (call it ''f(y(x))=y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''), use the chain rule:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx}=\frac{df}{dy}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}=2y\cdot y'&lt;/math&gt;

So the equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;2x+2yy'=0&lt;/math&gt;

Separate the variables:
:&lt;math&gt;2yy' = -2x\,&lt;/math&gt;

Divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;2y\,&lt;/math&gt;, and simplify to get the same result as above:
:&lt;math&gt;y' = -\frac{2x}{2y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = -\frac{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

===Uses===
Implicit differentiation is useful when differentiating an equation that cannot be explicitly differentiated  because it is impossible to isolate variables.

For example, consider the equation,
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + xy + y^2 = 16\,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiate both sides of the equation (remember to use the product rule on the term ''xy''):
:&lt;math&gt;2x + y + xy' + 2yy' = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Isolate terms with ''y''':
:&lt;math&gt;xy' + 2yy' = -2x - y\,&lt;/math&gt;

Factor out a ''y''' and divide both sides by the other term:
:&lt;math&gt;y' = \frac{-2x-y}{x+2y}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===

:&lt;math&gt;xy \,=1&lt;/math&gt;

can be solved as:

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

then differentiated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

However, using implicit differentiation it can also be differentiated like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[xy]=\frac{d}{dx}[1]&lt;/math&gt;

use the product rule:
:&lt;math&gt;x\frac{dy}{dx}+y=0&lt;/math&gt;

solve for &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, if we substitute &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, we end up with &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; again.

===Application: inverse trigonometric functions===

Arcsine, arccosine, arctangent.  These are the functions that allow you to determine the angle given the sine, cosine, or tangent of that angle. 

First, let us start with the arcsine such that:

:&lt;math&gt;y=\arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

To find ''dy''/''dx'' we first need to break this down into a form we can work with:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sin(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can take the derivative of that:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \cos(y) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

...and solve for ''dy'' / ''dx'':
[[Image:arcsin_derivative_triangle.png|right|thumb|y=arcsin(x) gives us this unit triangle.]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\cos(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point we need to go back to the unit triangle.  Since ''y'' is the angle and the opposite side is sin(''y'') (which is equal to ''x''), the adjacent side is cos(''y'') (which is equal to the square root of 1 minus ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, based on the Pythagorean theorem), and the hypotenuse is 1.  Since we have determined the value of cos(''y'') based on the unit triangle, we can substitute it back in to the above equation and get:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the Arcsine'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \arcsin(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

We can use an identical procedure for the arccosine and arctangent:



{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the Arccosine'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \arccos(x) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;'''Derivative of the Arctangent'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \arctan(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

{{spoiler}}

Three days pass, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] is still gone, while dark figures, apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], are constantly outside watching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. While awaiting Kreacher's return, the tension strains the Trio's nerves. Tiring of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s bickering, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] heads for the kitchen, hoping Kreacher will reappear there. Halfway down the stairs, he hears the front door opening and draws his wand. As a cloaked figure enters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s moldering form rushes at the mysterious stranger, who calls out, &quot;It was not I who killed you, Albus,&quot; causing Dumbledore to crumble back into dust. Aiming his wand, Harry shouts, &quot;Don't move!&quot; causing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Mrs. Black]]'s portrait to start screeching insults. As Ron and Hermione come running from upstairs, the voice identifies himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus]]. Hermione and Ron lower their wands, but only after further convincing is Harry finally persuaded to lowers his. Lupin, speaking as their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, reprimands Ron and Hermione for lowering their defenses too soon. Lupin confirms that Death Eaters are monitoring the house, though they apparently are unaware anyone is there. Any place associated with Harry is being watched.

Lupin updates them on recent events. He is stunned about the Death Eaters at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|Tottenham Court Road]], though he assures Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|the Trace]] cannot still be active, confirming Ron's earlier statement. Lupin reports that most wedding guests [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparated]] to safety, and that Death Eaters have infiltrated the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. It is rumoured that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]] was tortured before being killed, but he apparently never revealed Harry's location. Death Eaters searched [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]] and found the Spattergroit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghoul|Ghoul]], but avoided getting too close; everyone else at the Burrow was interrogated for hours. Although Death Eaters forced their way into other Order-related houses, no one has been killed, but some, like the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Tonks]], were tortured. Death Eaters were able to penetrate the magical charms surrounding the Burrow because they now have the Ministry's might behind them. Asked how they can legally justify their search, Lupin pulls out a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']]. On the front page is Harry's picture and the headline: WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.

Harry pushes the paper aside. Lupin says the Ministry claims that the murdered Scrimgeour actually resigned. He was replaced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], who is under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. This effectively makes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] the Minister for Magic. Though many wizards suspect what is happening in the Ministry, none dare speak out, fearing reprisals and unsure who &lt;!-- &quot;Whom&quot; is being phased out of English grammar. Please use &quot;who&quot;. --&gt; to trust, while Voldemort remains hidden to create fear and confusion. Dumbledore's death was certain to make Harry the rallying point for resistance fighters, only now, implicating him in Dumbledore's murder has cast doubt. Lupin also says the Ministry is rounding up Muggle-borns, claiming they acquired their magical powers by theft. Anyone without at least one close wizard relative is suspect. In addition, all wizard children can now study magic only at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], though this is actually a means to further weed out Muggle-borns – to attend Hogwarts, you must be able to prove Blood status.

The Order suspects Dumbledore assigned Harry a secret mission, which Harry confirms without confiding details. Lupin offers his assistance, even if they are unable to share what they are doing. When asked about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], Lupin says she will be fine at her parents' house. Hermione suspects he is withholding something, and Lupin reveals that Tonks is expecting a baby. Harry chastises him for abandoning his pregnant wife, but Lupin claims she is better off without him and that she should never have married an outcast. He fears their child will be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] like him and that he is an unfit father. Outraged that he would desert his family, Harry shouts that Lupin is a coward. Lupin, offended, rages out the front door, ignoring Hermione's pleas to stay. Hermione, supported by Ron, reproaches Harry, who now feels bad over how he treated Lupin, but still feels he was right.

Ignoring Ron and Hermione, Harry browses the ''Prophet''. Dumbledore's name jumps out, along with a photo of the entire Dumbledore family: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percival Dumbledore|Percival]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]], Albus and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and baby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]]. There is also a headline: EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]. The article describes Kendra as proud and haughty. After her husband's imprisonment in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], the family moved to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], Harry Potter's former home, where few knew them. Skeeter claims that Kendra thought she could hide Ariana, who was believed to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]]. The article concludes with, Next Week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts&amp;mdash;the Prizes and the Pretense.

Kreacher suddenly returns, clutching a flailing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who attempts to use his wand. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] him, and Ron wrestles him to the floor. With Kreacher wielding a pot at him, Mundungus admits he used the Locket to bribe a Ministry woman who caught him selling goods without a license. The woman was short, wearing a hair bow, and looked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|rather like a &quot;toad.&quot;]] Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange shocked expressions; the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 13|old scars on Harry's hand]] begin to prickle.

== Analysis ==

One must wonder somewhat about the Death Eaters' interest in the house at Grimmauld Place. It is clearly under surveillance, though no apparent attempt is made to enter it, indicating they are probably unable to detect the concealed residence's precise location. Clearly the Death Eaters believe that some Order member, possibly Harry, may be hiding inside, though it is learned that any place associated with Harry is being watched. We already know that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]] for the house's location; if it is believed that Harry may be in the house, why has Snape never shared the secret to a Death Eater squad so they could enter and ransack the place? If Snape is reluctant, why does Voldemort not order him to reveal this information? However, if Snape attempted to search Grimmauld Place after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] left, without knowing how to disarm the protective charms that were left behind, Snape may have been barred from entering, or, if he had bypassed that, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad Eye Moody]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tongue-Tying Curse|Tongue-tying Curse]] that greeted the Trio at the front entrance may be preventing Snape from divulging its location.

Harry's reaction to Lupin seems undeservedly harsh, but he immediately sees that Lupin, believing himself an unsuitable husband and father, is crafting a thinly-veiled excuse to leave Tonks, who he thinks deserves someone better. Having lost his own parents and godfather, being raised in a loveless household, and left feeling betrayed and set adrift by Dumbledore, Harry is infuriated that Lupin would abandon his pregnant wife in such desperate times and allow their unborn child to be raised without a father. Lupin's belief in his own unworthiness must seem particularly infuriating to him as Lupin, despite being a Werewolf, has risked his own life serving in the Order of the Phoenix fighting Voldemort and his Death Eaters, is always loyal to his friends. He has also exerted a significant positive influence on Harry and many other students while being a Hogwarts teacher. Lupin, like so many others when they appraise themselves, apparently fails to consider this, and, despite loving Tonks, instead feels that his outcast status in the Wizarding world far outweighs any sterling attributes and his responsibilities as a husband and father. Lupin leaves Grimmauld Place in a rage, and he and Harry seem permanently divided, but Harry's outburst likely will deeply affect him. Harry is also affected by their confrontation, and though Harry now regrets overreacting to Lupin, he remains convinced he is right.

Rita Skeeter's book excerpt has also troubled Harry, and he is confused by the Dumbledore family's behavior. He wonders how the Albus Dumbledore he knew could have come from the past Skeeter describes, though Harry actually knew little about Albus' life. Harry is also particularly dismayed to discover how far Kendra Dumbledore seemed willing to go to conceal her daughter Ariana.

Based on Mundungus Fletcher's description, the Trio is positive that the &quot;toad&quot; woman is none other than Ministry official Dolores Umbridge. Although they have located the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], they must now devise a plan to retrieve it&amp;mdash;an extremely difficult and dangerous undertaking. It is unclear yet if Umbridge knows the Locket's significance.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
#How did Lupin know where to find the Trio? How did he enter Grimmauld Place undetected by the ever-present Death Eaters?
#Why does Lupin offer to help with the Trio's mission?
#Who do the Trio think the &quot;toad woman&quot; might be? Are they correct, or are they rushing into an unfounded conclusion? 

=== Further Study ===
#If Death Eaters and Snape, who is a Secret Keeper, previously searched Grimmauld Place as Harry suspects, why are they unwilling or unable to enter it now?
#The mess in Sirius' room clearly indicates someone has been in Grimmauld Place. If Death Eaters did not enter Grimmauld Place, then who did and why?
#Why does Harry call Lupin a coward, even though Lupin is willing to risk his life to help with their mission? Was it proper of Harry to say that?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although Lupin is deeply angered and offended by Harry's outburst, its effect will reunite him and Tonks and, eventually, cause him to realize that he is indeed a fit husband and father. Lupin later asks Harry to be godfather to his newborn son, which Harry immediately accepts, indicating their relationship has healed.

The Trio's worry about Snape breaking in is not unfounded; we will [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|later learn]] that Snape had, in fact, visited Grimmauld Place, and was responsible for at least some of the mess in Sirius' bedroom. There is some confusion on when Snape visited; the account of the visit seems to place it after Harry's escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], a good two months after Dumbledore's funeral. According to an interview with the author, however, Snape entered Grimmauld Place immediately after Dumbledore's death, before the protective spells were implemented. Snape never reveals Grimmauld Place's location to other Death Eaters; he was apparently there only for personal reasons, rather than an attempt to capture Harry or uncover valuable information for Lord Voldemort. And though Voldemort is greatly skilled at Legilimency, Snape is highly adept at Occlumency, and can, presumably, keep this hidden.

As the Trio believes, the &quot;toad woman&quot; is Dolores Umbridge, who is likely oblivious to the Locket's status. To her, it is only an ornate piece of jewelry with an inlaid S, and something she is unable to open. Having extorted it from a petty street grifter, she would expect it to be little more than a cheap trinket or a moderately valuable stolen item, not an artifact worth thousands of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]]. And Horcruxes, being a mechanism for a person's immortality, would certainly be carefully protected and unavailable for sale on a street corner, though this one, by unusual circumstances, came to be. 

It also seems that Umbridge is using the Locket as a prop to bolster her possibly bogus claim that she is related to the ancient [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]] Wizarding family, on the strength of the inlaid S. If she is unrelated, she may be dangerously ignorant that a character named Selwyn likely does belong to that family, and he is a Death Eater. Considering how inter-connected most wizard families appear to be, it is certainly possible Umbridge could somehow be related to the Selwyns, though any relationship that might exist is likely being over-exaggerated by her.</text>

As it was told, we have 12 vowels and 34 consonants to learn. Traditional way is to mug-up the list, starting with all the vowels and then ending with consonants. Since it requires a teacher to constantly tell how to speak each character, and since we don't have a teacher here, we will start with the basics.

==Important note==
There is one very important part to note before we proceed. All the characters in Devanagari have a horizontal line on their top! All the characters!!

Just for comparison, we will show you some characters:

क ख ग घ ङ च छ ज झ ञ

'''Notice''' how every character has a '''horizontal line on top''' of it. It is very important to drive this point home, since it will be required later!!

==Your first character==
So here is your first consonant:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This symbol represent the ''sound'' of K.

Note the emphasis on ''sound''. &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is NOT &quot;K&quot;. In English &quot;C&quot; is also used sometimes for this same sound. For example:
'''C'''oal, '''K'''ill, '''C'''rack, Wi'''k'''iboo'''k''' and so on.

The pronunciation of &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is C as in '''c'''ome.

===Exercise===
1. Mark the occurrence of sound of K in the following sentence and replace them with equivalent letter of Devanagari:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jesus Christ. Kate. Christopher. Come. Cart. Crack. Kart-racing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{hidden begin|style=background:#F0F8FF|titlestyle=border:2px solid #50A6C2|title=Answer to this exercise}}
Jesus कrist. कate. कristopher. कome. कart. कraक. कart-racing.
{{hidden end}}

===Lesson to be learned===
#All of the characters in Devanagari have a horizontal line on top.
#What is &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.


Now let is proceed to your first vowel, because consonants have no life of their own :)

''NOTE: Most of the time the first reaction to this symbol is: it is hard to draw! In Devanagari, most of the characters are curvy. Although a pattern can be found on closer look, it is left for the reader - of course after all the characters are have been introduced.''

Now we introduce our first vowel.

We will also learn about using this vowel with the consonant क we learned in the last chapter.

==स्टार्ट==
So here is your first vowel:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;आ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This symbol represent the ''sound'' of &quot;a&quot; in f'''''a'''''ther.

That was easy! Now let us learn how to draw this character. What are the important features here?
# There is a &quot;3&quot; like character.
# Two vertical lines after that.
# A small horizontal line connecting the &quot;3&quot; to the first vertical line, perpendicularly.
# Like all Devanagari characters, there is a horizontal line on top. But it is not touching the &quot;3&quot;. Why so? For your ease, because it is easy to adjust the size of vertical lines to compensate the top horizontal line, but not so easy to adjust the &quot;3&quot;.

So, it is easy, isn't it? Write &quot;311&quot; and then add a horizontal line between 3 and 1, so that it looks like &quot;3-11&quot;. And then put a cap on top of 11. :)

==Addition rule==
Unlike Latin script, when we add vowels to a consonant, the form of vowel changes. Actually, it is more like the vowel &quot;leaving&quot; some of its trait in the consonant it is being added to. It may sound strange but it is a lot easier. Let us see how:

क + आ = का

Heh, that was easy! The trait of आ is the last vertical line.

So what did we learn? When you want to add the sound of &quot;a&quot; as in f'''''a'''''ther, add a vertical line after the consonant.

And here is your first word: काका (kākā) (father's elder brother in Hindi)


===Exercise===
1. Mark the occurrence of sound of आ in the following sentence and replace them with equivalent letter of Devanagari:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cart. Kampf. Father. Kafka.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Anyone who can think of anymore English words?&lt;/pre&gt;

{{hidden begin|style=background:#F0F8FF;|titlestyle=border:2px solid #50A6C2|title=Answer to this exercise}}
काrt. काmpf. fआther. काfका.
{{hidden end}}

===Lesson to be learned===
#What is &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;आ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.
#How to add आ in a consonant.


Armed with one vowel, you can now tackle some more consonants.

== Well ==

You had me thinking there!  I was pretty sure I hadn't used a quote here and I do like folk who look around wikis (I do it myself).  My sense of humour is fairly off the wall (&amp; not always appreciated or indeed understood!).  I spotted the hemp one on RC earlier and thought the idea looked very worthwhile - I'll look some more &amp; help if I can.  Let me know if I can help - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:14, 12 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|The Outsourcing MBA}}

This textbook identifies and develops the skills, knowledge and core competencies required in the client, the supplier and advisor organizations to enable the outsourcing market to grow and to realise the business value.  The industry needs a higher number of experienced and qualified technicians, enterprise architects and managers that can cope with the complexity of working in multi-sourcing environments.  The aim is to develop a general curriculum and supporting textbook that will be the standard text for a specialized MBA/MSc degree in the management of outsourcing agreements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discussion Questions ==

I've noticed that some chapter Discussion questions are worded in such a way that they cannot be answered by the reader. By that, I mean that there's no information in the synopsis about it or it's related to something that is revealed in a later chapter. I've reworded some questions to ask readers to speculate why something &quot;might&quot; have happened rather ask them to give a definitive answer. I know some of the information may be in the &quot;Analysis&quot; or &quot;Greater Picture&quot; section, but the questions should, IMHO, relate only to what is covered in that specific chapter. Any thoughts about this? [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 17:01, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:I like to eliminate unanswerable questions, especially those relating to this last book. Most of the ones I eliminate are factual and ask things like what someone's Patronus might look like that we never find out. Those sorts of things don't bring about much critical thought, just fantasy. A question's answer doesn't have to be in a synopsis in my opinion, especially that current chapter's synopsis (although if we're writing good synopses it most likely will be since the question should be important enough to find an answer to). Questions often provide foreshadowing and help the reader think about what might be happening later which I think is a very good thing. I don't like having too many factual questions even if they can be answered because we want readers to think about various themes, relationships, etc., not just look up facts and memorize them like an encyclopedia. There is little to no value in knowing that Harry's Patronus is a stag, but there is quite a powerful message in why his Patronus is the stag and how that creature connects to other events and characters. I never want the questions answered here in the book because if it can be answered (at least easily) then it very well might not be a good question to have at all. Many of our questions should be open to some degree of personal opinion and insight into a matter. Hope this answers your questions. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:59, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

::I definitely want thought-provoking questions that speculate on outcome as well as facutal ones, just not ones like the example you gave above, such as, what shape did so-and-so's patronus take when there's absolutely no mention in the synopsis about what it was. Another was, why did Dumbledore bequest those particular objects to H,R,&amp;H, an answer that is unknown until later in the book. We can ask why he ''might'' have given them to the trio, but that is information that is not given in that particular chapter. That's what we need to be careful of.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 19:52, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:::I think the important thing here is not whether the questions are factual or not, nor whether they are answered in the summary -- though a good question won't be. The questions should be selected so as to make the reader think about what is going on. So as withinfocus says, asking what shape Snape's Patronus would be (at least, before we have actually seen it) is pointless; asking why has some value, because it leads the reader to think about what would shape Snape's life and what influences him. It is because of this that I would tend to retain questions about the shape of (say) Flitwick's patronus, because while the answer is speculation, if we add that &quot;why?' it becomes supported speculation, and that would require some thought.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Advanced Haskell}}

Applicative functors are functors with some extra properties; the most important one is that it allows you to apply functions inside the functor (hence the name) to other values. First we do a quick recap of functors, next we will see the applicative functors, and for what structure they are used. After that, we'll see that we can get an applicative functor out of every monad, and then we'll see an example of an applicative functor that is not a monad, but still very useful.

== Functors ==

Functors, or instances of the typeclass &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, are some of the most often used structures in Haskell. Typically, they are structures that &quot;can be mapped over&quot;. Here is the class definition of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;:

  class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b

The most well-known functor is the list, where &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Another example is &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;:

  instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
    fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing

Typically, for all tree-like structures you can write an instance of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Exercises|1=
Define instances of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; for the following types:
# The rose tree type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;, defined by: &lt;pre&gt;data Tree a = Node a [Tree a]&lt;/pre&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;Either e&lt;/code&gt; for a fixed &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.
# The function type &lt;code&gt;((-&gt;) t)&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, &lt;code&gt;f a&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;(t -&gt; a)&lt;/code&gt;
}}

== Applicative Functors ==

Applicative functors are functors with extra properties: you can apply functions inside a functor to values that can be inside the functor or not. We will first look at the definition, then at some instances of applicative functors and their most important use.

=== Definition ===

  class (Functor f) =&gt; Applicative f where
    pure  :: a -&gt; f a
    (&lt;*&gt;) :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b

The &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt; function lifts any value inside the functor. &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; changes a function inside the functor to a function over values of the functor. The functor should satisfy some laws:

  pure id &lt;*&gt; v = v                            -- Identity
  pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w) -- Composition
  pure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = pure (f x)               -- Homomorphism
  u &lt;*&gt; pure y = pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u              -- Interchange

And the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instance should satisfy the following law:

  fmap f x = pure f &lt;*&gt; x                      -- Fmap

=== Instances ===

As we have seen the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instance of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, let's try to make it &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; as well.

The definition of &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt; is easy. It is &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;. Now the definition of &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. If any of the two arguments is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, the result should be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, we extract the function and its argument from the two &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; values, and return &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; the function applied to its argument:

  instance Applicative Maybe where
    pure = Just
    (Just f) &lt;*&gt; (Just x) = Just (f x)
    _        &lt;*&gt; _        = Nothing

{{Exercises|1=
# Check that the Applicative laws hold for this instance for &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;
# Write &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; instances for 
:# &lt;code&gt;Either e&lt;/code&gt;, for a fixed &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;
:# &lt;code&gt;((-&gt;) t)&lt;/code&gt;, for a fixed &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;
}}

=== Using Applicative Functors ===

The use of &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; may not be immediately clear, so let us look at some example that you may have come across yourself.

Suppose we have the following function:

  f :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
  f x y = 2 * x + y

But instead of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;s, we want to apply this function to values of type &lt;code&gt;Maybe Int&lt;/code&gt;. Because you've seen this problem before, you decide to write a function &lt;code&gt;fmap2&lt;/code&gt;:

  fmap2 :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b -&gt; Maybe c
  fmap2 f (Just x) (Just y) = Just (f x y)
  fmap2 _ _        _        = Nothing

You are happy for a while, but then you find that &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; really needs another &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; argument. But now, &lt;code&gt;fmap2&lt;/code&gt; isn't sufficient anymore. You need another function to accommodate for this extra parameter:

  fmap3 :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b -&gt; Maybe c -&gt; Maybe d
  fmap3 f (Just x) (Just y) (Just z) = Just (f x y z)
  fmap3 _ _        _        _        = Nothing

This is all good as such, but what if &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; suddenly needs 4 arguments, or 5, or 10?

Here is where &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; comes in. Look at what happens if you write &lt;code&gt;fmap f&lt;/code&gt;:

  f      :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c)
  fmap   :: Functor f =&gt; (d -&gt; e) -&gt; f d -&gt; f e
  fmap f :: Functor f =&gt;             f a -&gt; f (b -&gt; c)    -- Identify d with a, and e with (b -&gt; c)

Now the use of &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; becomes clear. Once we have the final &lt;code&gt;f (b -&gt; c)&lt;/code&gt;, we can use it to get a &lt;code&gt;(f b -&gt; f c)&lt;/code&gt;. And indeed:

  fmap2 f a b = f `fmap` a &lt;*&gt; b
  fmap3 f a b c = f `fmap` a &lt;*&gt; b &lt;*&gt; c
  fmap4 f a b c d = f `fmap` a &lt;*&gt; b &lt;*&gt; c &lt;*&gt; d

To make it look more pretty, the {{Haskell lib|Control|Applicative}} library defines &lt;code&gt;(&lt;$&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; as a synonym of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;. The ultimate result is that the code is much cleaner to read and easier to adapt and reuse.

  fmap2 f a b = f &lt;$&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b
  fmap3 f a b c = f &lt;$&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b &lt;*&gt; c
  fmap4 f a b c d = f &lt;$&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b &lt;*&gt; c &lt;*&gt; d

Anytime you feel the need to define different higher order functions to accommodate for function-arguments with a different number of arguments, think about how defining a proper instance of &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; can make your life easier.

Of course, {{Haskell lib|Control|Applicative}} provides the above functions as convenience, under the names of &lt;code&gt;liftA&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;liftA3&lt;/code&gt;.

== Monads and Applicative Functors ==

The type of &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt; may look familiar. Indeed, if you change its typeclass restriction from:

  Applicative f =&gt; a -&gt; f a

to 

  Monad m       =&gt; a -&gt; m a

it has exactly the same type as &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;.

As a matter of fact, every instance of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; can also be made an instance of &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt;. Here are the definitions that can be used:

  pure  = return
  (&lt;*&gt;) = ap
  
Here, &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; is defined as:

  ap f a = do
    f' &lt;- f
    a' &lt;- a
    return (f' a')

It is also defined in {{Haskell lib|Control|Monad}}

{{Exercises|1=
Check that the &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; instance of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; can be obtained by the above transformation.
}}

== ZipLists ==

Let's come back now to the idea that &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; can make life easier.  Perhaps the best known example of this are the different &lt;code&gt;zipWithN&lt;/code&gt; functions of {{Haskell lib|Data|List}}. It looks exactly like the kind of pattern that an applicative functor would be useful for.

For technical reasons, we can not define a &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; instance for &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, as it already has one defined. This instance does something completely different. &lt;code&gt;fs &lt;*&gt; xs&lt;/code&gt; takes all functions from &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; and applies them to all values in &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;. To remedy this, we create a wrapper:

  newtype ZipList a = ZipList [a]
  
  instance Functor ZipList where
    fmap f (ZipList xs) = ZipList (map f xs)

To make this an instance of &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; with the expected behaviour, we shall first look at the definition of &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, as it follows quite straightforward from what we want to do. The &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; operator takes a list of functions and a list of values, and it should apply the functions to the values in a pairwise way. This sounds a lot like &lt;code&gt;zipWith ($)&lt;/code&gt;, we just need to add the &lt;code&gt;ZipList&lt;/code&gt; wrapper:

  instance Applicative ZipList where
    (ZipList fs) &lt;*&gt; (ZipList xs) = ZipList $ zipWith ($) fs xs
    pure                          = undefined

Now we only need to define &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt;. If we define it like this:

  pure x = ZipList [x]

it won't satisfy the Identity law, &lt;code&gt;pure id &lt;*&gt; v = v&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; can contain more than one element, and &lt;code&gt;zipWith&lt;/code&gt; only returns a list of the smaller of the two input sizes. Since we don't know how many elements &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; has, the safest way is to let &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt; return a list of infinite elements. Now our instance declaration is complete:

  instance Applicative ZipList where
    (ZipList fs) &lt;*&gt; (ZipList xs) = ZipList (zipWith ($) fs xs)
    pure x                        = ZipList (repeat x)

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Sprawled on the Headmaster's office floor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] now understands his own destiny. Under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], he proceeds to the Entrance Hall, almost bumping into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who is returning from the grounds with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]]. They are carrying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey's]] body into the castle. Oliver says he can handle this on his own, and Neville returns to the grounds to search for more casualties. Harry follows and reveals himself to Neville. Harry tells Neville that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] must be killed to defeat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. He says that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] also know, but if for some reason they are unable to, then Neville must kill Nagini. Neville says he will, and Harry puts the cloak back on and proceeds to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Noticing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] helping a fallen girl along the way, he is tempted to stop and speak with her, but knowing it would be impossible for him to continue if he did, he goes on, past [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s hut and to the Forest.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] gliding around the forest's edge block Harry's path, and he lacks the strength to conjure another Patronus. Harry pulls the Snitch from his pouch. Remembering its inscription, &quot;I open at the close,&quot; he realizes it refers to death. Pressing the Snitch to his lips, he whispers, &quot;I am about to die.&quot; The Snitch breaks open and reveals the Peverell ring, which Harry realizes holds the cracked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]]. He turns the stone three times and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shades]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] appear. All seem ghostly but are more solid-looking than just spirits. Lupin and Sirius both appear younger and each looks happy. His mother and father speak to Harry, telling him how proud they are of him and offer comfort as he prepares to die. Harry asks if dying hurts, but Sirius says it is painless and easier than falling asleep. Harry tells Remus that he is sorry that he will not know his son. Remus regrets he is unable to be there for him, but is glad Teddy will grow up in a better world that his death helped to make possible. The spirits promise to stay with Harry and protect him as he passes through the Dementors, acting as Patronuses. Harry is able to force himself to go on only because the spirits remain with him. 

Harry makes his way through the thick, tangled woods, unaware just where he is heading: the spirits, remaining close to his side, appear to guide him. As he nears Voldemort's camp, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]] think they hear something, but suspect it is probably an animal. The hour Voldemort has given Harry is nearly up, and it appears that Harry Potter will not appear. Still cloaked, Harry enters a clearing where he sees two [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]] and Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] is skulking nearby, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and his wife, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] are also there, both appearing defeated and apprehensive. Harry recognizes the camp site as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog's]] old lair, his descendants forced out by Death Eaters to fight for their cause.

Voldemort says aloud he thought Harry would come, but no one responds to his words. Harry pulls off the Cloak and tucks it, and his wand, under his robes. The Resurrection Stone slips from his fingers, and the spirits vanish. Voldemort speaks again. &quot;I was, it seems... mistaken.&quot; 

Harry loudly replies, &quot;You weren't.&quot; 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], tightly bound to a tree nearby, warningly yells at Harry, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Rowle]] silences him.

As Harry's final thoughts turn to Ginny, Voldemort casts the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] at him.

== Analysis ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]] memories have answered many questions, and the truth is not what Harry or the reader expected. Not only are Harry's doubts and fears about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] seemingly justified, but Dumbledore was apparently protecting him all these years only to fulfill his ultimate plan, involving sacrificing Harry to defeat Voldemort. Surprisingly, Harry accepts this, and he willingly goes to face Voldemort and meet his fate in order to save others. Snape is also vindicated, and his heroism and sacrifice are finally revealed. Even though this does not fully exonerate Snape's behavior, if Harry survives, he will eventually have to reconcile his long-held hatred for his belligerent teacher with new-found gratitude to the tragic man who protected him and aided his quest, losing his own life in the process.

Harry's brief discussion with Neville about Nagini needing to be killed highlights Harry's increasing awareness that he is not alone in this battle, nor is it even limited to himself, Ron, and Hermione. He sees that the battle at Hogwarts is joined not on his behalf, but under his banner, and he has witnessed the sacrifices others are willing to make to defeat the Dark Lord. Perhaps his new awareness about Snape's sacrifices has assisted him in this understanding. In any event, while he still withholds details about his mission, he now shows more willingness to ask others for help when needed.

Harry's one comfort before facing death is being reunited with his parents, though, unlike the brother in the tale, he realizes that the boundary between the living and the dead can be crossed permanently only in one direction. By understanding and accepting this, Harry becomes death's master. He feels justified in summoning James and Lily's spirits only so they can escort him to the Netherworld, rather than resurrect them from the grave. Meeting his parents and hearing their words completes his emotional need for their love and approval, and for closure. They also provide comfort and guidance as he is about to encounter his own death.

Harry's deep love for Ginny is seen here. First, as Harry spots Ginny as he leaves Hogwarts, he longs to bid her farewell, but fearing he will be unable to continue prevents him from doing so. Also, and perhaps most telling, as Harry faces his death, it is only Ginny's kiss he recalls, rather than his parents, or even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], showing that Ginny has provided the most comfort and joy in his life. On Ginny's part, as Harry passes near her, he believes she sensed him, despite being hidden by the Invisibility Cloak. While he cannot know this for certain, as he never looks back, this indicates his trust in Ginny's love.

We note that Harry tasks Neville with killing Nagini in the event that he, Ron, or Hermione are unable to (or are all killed). Although Harry fully trusts Neville to follow through on his request, Harry, probably overcome with his impending demise, has neglected to instruct Neville on just how to kill a Horcrux. If that is indeed what Nagini is, then she will likely need to be slain by one of the same methods that destroyed the other Horcruxes, though Neville apparently knows nothing about that. If Neville should attempt to kill Nagini by more conventional means, his own life will likely be lost.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry's death, as we can surmise from the two large remaining chapters, does not occur at this juncture. Dumbledore's actual intent is revealed in the next chapter. There, it is learned that Dumbledore knew that Voldemort, by his own actions, had unintentionally extended Harry's protection against anything Voldemort could inflict on him. Harry was unaware that this protection existed, and had expected that he could die when he faced Voldemort.

There is a faint suggestion that Harry knows some aspects of Dumbledore's plan. Note that Harry carefully hides [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy's]] captured wand under his shirt, along with the Invisibility Cloak. It is uncertain why he does this, if he was expecting to die. He may believe, or at least hope, he is protected from the Elder Wand, as that wand may now recognize whoever wields Draco's wand as its master; Harry may simply wish to prevent Voldemort from using the Invisibility Cloak and capturing Draco's wand, which might grant him the the Elder Wand's full power. In any event, Harry's concealing the wand and Invisibility Cloak may indicate he holds some hope, however slim, that he will survive the encounter. As he has no knowledge that he retains the blood protection, his hope seems to hinge on the Elder Wand and its current allegiance.

From the conversations with Snape in the previous chapter, we know why Harry must face Voldemort. In that chapter, it is revealed that Harry is carrying a fragment of Voldemort's soul, and that must be destroyed to end Voldemort's immortality. It may be worth mentioning that while this performs the same function a a Horcrux, it is not a true Horcrux; the soul fragment is merely sticking to Harry's soul, it has not been bound to him by the necessary magic to make Harry a Horcrux. As such, destruction of the soul fragment does not require destruction of its container (Harry). It is because of this that Harry is able to survive the encounter with Voldemort. There is more information on this in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes#Greater Picture|Greater Picture section of the article on Horcruxes]].

The final chapter reveals that one reason Harry so willingly, if fearfully, goes to what he suspects will be his death is because he knows about the charm that protected him following his mother's death. Harry believes, correctly, that his death will likewise protect Hogwarts, the place he loves, and everyone in it, from Voldemort's magic. While he cannot know whether this will work, and is likely too distracted by his impending demise to clearly consider the matter, he must see that this is the best, last hope for Hogwarts and its defenders.

Harry's dropping the Resurrection Stone, rather than being unplanned, is actually a conscious decision. It is uncertain how many times it was used, as, historically, it was apparently only collected as a Peverell relic. But Harry has seen that its effects can be fatal; Dumbledore was tempted to try and recall his dead family with it, and the stone's original owner, by legend, killed himself upon realizing he could never truly rejoin his lost love on this side of the Veil. Harry, as noted above, has not used the stone to recall his lost loved ones back to life, or a pale imitation of life; rather, he recalls them partly for reassurance that there is an existence beyond death, and partly as comfort in what he believes will be his final moments. Harry is mature enough to know that these summoned shades are not, and never can be, the people he remembers, and feels, correctly, that the ability to summon the dead does not belong in the living world. The Stone, now somewhere underfoot in the Forbidden Forest's dark depths, is unlikely to ever be found again.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

August passes, and, each day, several mysterious strangers, always different, lurk outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place]]. On September 1st, the day students return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], at least half a dozen men in long, dark cloaks appear, watching outside the house. The Trio, meanwhile, has been taking turns spying on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] to learn its operations and routines. Returning under his Cloak, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] onto Grimmauld's front stoop, landing badly, and worries that his elbow was momentarily exposed. A nearby lurker seemingly glimpses something, then appears uncertain and relaxes. Safely inside, Harry heads to the kitchen, which is nearly unrecognizable due to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]]'s cleaning efforts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], sitting at the kitchen table, are poring over copious notes and hand-drawn maps. Harry hands them a pinched [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']], warning them it contains bad news. The headline reads: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|SEVERUS SNAPE]] CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER. Hermione suddenly jumps up and runs from the kitchen.

The article reports that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] have been appointed as the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] instructors. Harry recognizes the Carrows' photos: they were among the Death Eaters atop the Astronomy Tower the night Dumbledore was murdered. Ron and Harry believe the other teachers will remain at the school only to protect the students though Harry also thinks they probably have little choice&amp;mdash;it is either stay at Hogwarts or be sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Harry mentions the more than usual [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] outside, almost as if they are expecting the Trio to march off to King's Cross station to catch the Hogwarts Express. Harry comments that at least they now know where Severus Snape is. 

Hermione returns lugging [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black's]] empty portrait and stuffs it into her beaded carrying bag, explaining that if Snape sends Phineas from his Hogwarts' portrait to Grimmauld Place, he will be unable to see or hear anything from inside the bag. As they are discussing the Ministry of Magic, Harry suddenly announces they will [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|infiltrate it]] the next day. They know enough, and it is too dangerous to wait any longer. Both Ron and Hermione look frightened. 

Harry suddenly excuses himself, claiming he has to go to the bathroom, but pain is shooting through his scar. Grasping the wash basin, he sees himself gliding down a twilit street lined with gabled houses in some unknown European village. A door cracks open, and a high-pitched voice asks for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]]. A foreign woman insists he has moved. A green flash follows, then Harry hears Hermione shouting. Slumped on the floor, Harry gets up and unlocks the door. Despite Harry's claim nothing is wrong, Ron and Hermione insist they heard him cry out. Harry admits seeing Voldemort murdering a woman and her family. Hermione is upset that Harry refuses to block Voldemort using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]], but Harry believes knowing his actions is useful. Voldemort is hunting Gregorovitch, the foreign wand maker who crafted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]]'s wand. Considering Voldemort has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] imprisoned, Ron wonders why he is looking for another wand maker. Harry speculates that Voldemort may believe that Gregorovitch can explain why Voldemort's wand failed against Harry's. Late into the night, they review their plan to invade the Ministry.

Early the next morning, Hermione reviews what items they will need while Kreacher promises steak and kidney pie when they return. They Disapparate to the Ministry, arriving in a nearby alleyway. Hermione stuns a Ministry woman named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]]. After plucking a few hairs off the unconscious woman, Hermione drinks the Polyjuice Potion. Ron and Harry also find employees to impersonate. Ron becomes a maintenance worker named Reg Cattermole, though Harry does not yet know his own identity. Entering an underground public restroom with other employees, they insert tokens into cubicle doors and step into toilets that flush them dry into the Ministry of Magic's Atrium.

The Atrium has changed&amp;mdash;it is darker, and the central golden fountain has been replaced by a frightening statue with a witch and wizard seated upon ornately carved thrones depicting writhing nude and ugly-faced men, women, and children. Harry is bumped by a man calling him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albert Runcorn|Runcorn]]. His subservient tone suggests that Runcorn is a high official. A Death Eater named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] approaches Ron (as Cattermole) and orders him to attend to the rain in his office. Yaxley makes threats about Cattermole's wife, who is appearing before the Muggle-Born Registration Commission that day. In a lift (elevator) Hermione whispers hints to Ron for fixing Yaxley's office before he gets off on Level Two. On Level One, a squat, toad-like witch wearing a velvet bow in her hair steps into the lift.

== Analysis ==

Fear and suspicion have permeated the Wizarding world, and readers can see in this chapter and the next just how Voldemort exploits that to seize control. By systematically infiltrating wizard institutions such as the Ministry of Magic, falsifying scientific research, and manipulating the media (''The Daily Prophet'') to disseminate propaganda, Voldemort was able to implement his plan to eliminate blood traitors and Muggle-borns like Hermione, who are accused of acquiring their magic by having stolen it from other wizards. Many Death Eaters and other Voldemort sympathizers (mostly Slytherins) already worked at the Ministry, making its takeover relatively easy. As a result, new laws and regulations are constantly being enacted and all wizards must now register to prove their magical lineage; any known or suspected Muggle-borns are interrogated and separated from their families, their eventual fates uncertain. Intimidation, coercion, spying, and threat tactics are also employed to suppress opposition, while corrupt, ambitious bureaucrats like Dolores Umbridge, who, though they are not Death Eaters, willingly help spearhead the Dark Lord's evil rise to power to benefit themselves. Meanwhile, Voldemort deliberately remains elusive to create doubt and confusion among the general Wizarding population and to avoid giving his enemies a specific target to rally against. Even Hogwarts has fallen victim, and every wizard child must now attend only that school. This enables Death Eaters to indoctrinate impressionable young minds to Voldemort's depraved beliefs, as well as provide a convenient mechanism to identify and cull Muggle-borns. 

Conquering the Muggle realm may also be included in Voldemort's grandiose scheme, if the new atrium statue is any indication. The monument, like the previously destroyed &quot;Fountain of Magical Brethren,&quot; appears to represent the Ministry's new public mission. The figures, a magical couple seated on thrones made of struggling Muggles, reveals how much control Voldemort has gained over the Wizarding realm and how little, if any, concern he and the Ministry now have for Muggles' welfare. Indeed, the statue can be interpreted as wizards suppressing, and possibly exterminating and/or enslaving, Muggles.

Any reader doubting that one individual can attain the power to convert an entire state to their perverted political design need only to draw parallels between Voldemort's Muggle-born persecution and Adolf Hitler exterminating six million Jews and other so-called &quot;undesirables&quot; in Nazi Germany during the mid-20th century. Both movements were driven by a maniacal but charismatic dictator who, exploiting the masses' anxieties and prejudices, advocated an elitist ruling class and purging &quot;racially impure&quot; citizens who were blamed for causing most social, political, and economic ills within their society.

Meanwhile, Hermione stuffs Phineas' portrait into her bag to prevent him relaying information to Snape via his other portrait in the Headmaster's office. He has had ample time to have already done that, however. Phineas' allegiance is as yet unclear, and though he has always appeared loyal to Dumbledore in the past, that is no guide to the current situation. It is likely that Phineas' fidelity will have changed with the new Headmaster, as the portraits, we heard earlier, are supposedly loyal to &quot;the Headmaster of Hogwarts&quot;, which Snape now is. It is also possible, though less likely, that Phineas' loyalty to Dumbledore was false; Phineas certainly seemed, on occasion, reluctant to follow Dumbledore's instructions. Almost certainly, this reluctance is due to Phineas' and Dumbledore's widely differing philosophies. At one point in the story, Dumbledore remarks that Phineas Nigellus Black was the most-hated Headmaster in Hogwarts' history, and we have seen in earlier books how his attitude towards the students would have contributed to that hatred. Snape's disdain for the students, and his Slytherin House background, could make Phineas more willing to carry out his requests. Just how Dumbledore's portrait is interacting in these matters is unknown, and whether or not he is &quot;loyal&quot; to Snape simply because he is now a portrait and is expected to offer his allegiance to him is certainly something readers must be speculating about. 

Phineas may have already informed Snape that the Trio is in residence at Grimmauld Place. However, if he has, that information does not appear to have been relayed to Voldemort. Even though Death Eaters are constantly outside watching the Black family residence, they seem uncertain as to whether the Trio is actually within, though perhaps what they are actually unsure of is where exactly the house is.

Harry's apparent utter inability (or stubborn refusal) to learn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] was a contributing factor in the events leading to his godfather [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] death. However, it is this same failure, we believe, which now allows Harry to view some events occurring in Voldemort's mind:  Harry already senses their value to the Trio's mission, despite the physical pain they cause, and he is therefore resistant to Hermione's repeated pleas that he practice Occlumency to block them. Later, it is revealed that Voldemort will largely lose control over his skill at Legilimency and Occlumency, at least as far as Harry is concerned. After possessing Harry's mind once before, Voldemort found Harry's strong memories and deep emotions of love, friendship, and loyalty so disturbing that he never attempts to enter it again; Harry, however, will eventually be able to penetrate Voldemort's mind almost at will and, apparently, without Voldemort's knowledge. By reading Voldemort's thoughts, Harry later uncovers vital information that will help destroy the Horcruxes.

Phineas Nigellus Black, we will learn, is accepting instructions from Snape, and that Snape is allied to Dumbledore's cause. On initial inspection, if Phineas is Dumbledore's ally, it would seem that he should have relayed helpful information from Dumbledore's Hogwarts portrait to the Trio at Grimmauld Place, although that apparently has not occurred. Dumbledore seems to have deliberately withheld information from the Trio that would aid their mission, and his portrait may be doing the same, though just why is unclear. And while Dumbledore has not relayed any information to the Trio via Phineas, it should be assumed that if Phineas is loyal to Dumbledore, he is probably updating Snape and Dumbledore's portrait about the Trio's activities. It will be revealed that Dumbledore had reasons for withholding information from the Trio, and, perhaps surprisingly, from Snape, reasons that remain valid. 

Hermione stuffs Phineas Nigellus' portrait into her magical bag to prevent him spying on the Trio, but she fails to consider that he may still be able to hear them. When she accidentally leaves the bag open in a later chapter, Phineas overhears some vital information that he relays to Severus Snape, and it will actually aid the Trio. Phineas will also provide the Trio with helpful updates regarding Hogwarts, though it remains unknown which side, if any, Phineas is actually on.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] is overjoyed to see them, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are horrified by his battered appearance. Neville says this is nothing, wait till they see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]]. Neville informs a dismayed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] that more people will be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparating]] in. Leading the Trio down the long, dark tunnel, Neville explains that the seven known secret passageways into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] have been magically sealed, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] guard the exits. Everyone is talking about the Trio breaking into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] and escaping on a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]]. Harry confirms it is true. 

Hogwarts has drastically changed since the Trio left. The Carrows, the two Death Eater professors now handle all student punishment, though the other teachers avoid sending anyone to them whenever possible. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] teaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], now just called &quot;Dark Arts.&quot; Students are forced to practice the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus]] curse on detention students. Neville's refusal to curse anyone resulted in him being beaten, despite him being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|Pure Blood]]. Some students, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], have proven quite apt at the Dark Arts and love practicing them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]] teacher, insists Muggles are dirty and stupid like animals. Neville obtained one scar after asking how much Muggle blood she had. Neville and other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] members were pulling pranks and creating disruptions, but after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] left school and punishments became more severe, the rebellion died down a bit. When Neville was identified as a ringleader, Death Eaters went after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother]], who put [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], and is now on the run. Neville decided to &quot;disappear&quot;.

Reaching Hogwarts, they enter an unfamiliar room to a cheering crowd inside. The Trio are ecstatic to see old friends&amp;mdash;Seamus Finnigan, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Terry Boot|Terry Boot]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Anthony Goldstein|Anthony Goldstein]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Padma Patil|Padma Patil]], and many more. Hammocks are strung from floor to ceiling, and the room is embellished with Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw colors and symbols; only Slytherin is missing. To Harry's astonishment, they are in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. Neville has been hiding there for some weeks now, and the room has continually expanded as more D.A. members arrived. Seamus, whose swollen face Harry initially failed to recognize, says the room is secure as long as at least one D.A. member remains inside. The only thing it is unable to provide is food. When Neville was really hungry, the tunnel leading to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] opened, and Aberforth has been sending supplies ever since. 

Everyone wants to know about the Trio's exploits. They have been listening to &quot;Potterwatch&quot; on the radio, but there are many unconfirmed rumors. Before Harry can respond, searing pain cuts through his scar as he briefly glimpses a furious [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Dark Lord]] discovering that the Ring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] is missing. Little time is left, and everyone wants to help, believing Harry has returned to overthrow the Carrows and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]. Harry explains they are only there to complete a task to help to destroy Voldemort, and insists everyone stay behind. He becomes panicked when more people pour in from the Hog's Head. Luna, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] climb through. Hermione agrees with Ron's suggestion that the others help them search. Harry does not need to do everything alone, time is running out, and they do not have to reveal what they are hunting. Harry finally concedes and says they are looking for something belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]. Luna thinks it could be the lost diadem, a type of crown. Hidden under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], Luna leads Harry to the Ravenclaw Common room and shows him Rowena Ravenclaw's statue. As Harry steps out from under the Cloak, Alecto Carrow appears and instantly touches the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] on her forearm.

== Analysis ==

Against Harry's wishes, the final battle between him and Voldemort is primed to happen at Hogwarts, his arrival likely triggering it. It seems appropriate, indeed inevitable, that Harry and Voldemort's last confrontation should occur here; the castle and its surrounding grounds have played a major role throughout the story, and is where much of the series' action is set. With its many [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|talking portraits]], and other magical denizens, the castle is nearly a character in its own right. It is also the place that both Harry and Voldemort most consider home, and in Voldemort's case, probably the only thing he has ever had anything close to loving feelings for, though that is an emotion he can never fully experience. Harry loves Hogwarts, and he has always derived strength and security from the venerable old castle, enduring his enforced summer hiatus at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']] while impatiently waiting to return each September. This time, Harry's arrival is as a soldier on a mission rather than as a returning student, and Hogwarts is hardly a safe sanctuary but an imminent battleground, though that was never Harry's intention, nor does he have a battle plan. Regardless, reinforcements begin arriving, and Harry is deeply dismayed, because now, rather than sneaking in, finding the Horcrux, then sneaking out again to continue his quest, his appearance has set off a chain reaction of events that will culminate in a final resolution. And like it or not, Harry is the shining beacon that rallies and unifies the fragmented rebellion, and he is being pushed to the forefront to lead the climactic clash against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. 

Harry also sees how much Hogwarts has changed, including Neville Longbottom. While Neville's battered appearance is shocking, his cheerful demeanor about it seems even more so. This clearly shows just how much Neville has grown from the ineffectual, frightened boy who first arrived at Hogwarts; he wears his bruises as badges of honor. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] placing Neville into Gryffindor House had always seemed questionable, and many readers probably, at least initially, believed he would have been better suited to Hufflepuff, rather than a House known for bravery and nobility. But courage and nobleness comes in many forms, and Neville, despite his magical deficiencies and timid nature, has always faced the adversity in his life head on, and showed fortitude as early as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|the first book]], when he challenged the Trio after objecting to their questionable actions. This strength has gradually increased, and Neville has transformed from a shy, insecure, and nearly incompetent student, into a strong, capable wizard, mostly due to Harry's patient guidance.

Curiously, and appropriately, while Harry's influence helped develop Neville's character and magical abilities, Neville, in true epic-hero tradition, has grown significantly more during Harry's absence, just as Harry has further developed after Dumbledore's demise. Neville, along with Ginny and Luna, have assumed leadership roles by ably guiding Dumbledore's Army following Harry's departure, rebelling against the Carrows and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]. Neville shows that, given the right circumstances, he is a natural leader, as well as a true Gryffindor; he, and the other D.A. members, are ready and able to join forces with Harry in the final battle against Voldemort.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Against his will, Harry becomes the rallying point for defending Hogwarts. This is, at least for the next while, a position that we see Harry attempting to sidestep. Harry quite clearly wants to avoid the coming battle, not because he is reluctant to fight, but rather because he feels personally responsible for all the deaths and injuries that would likely occur. He also sees this as being his own battle, and is extremely reluctant to involve others. He is clearly bewildered by the alacrity with which others seem to be taking up his cause, hardly realizing that so many other wizards are equally oppressed and have been searching for a banner to rally around. It is only after the encounter in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], when Harry feels he has acted to protect his friends against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], that he chooses to show himself as the leader of the counter-attack against the Dark Lord and his Death Eater army.

As mentioned above, Neville seems almost astoundingly changed, on this sudden arrival. We can see that this has actually been a more gradual development, if we review how he has changed over the previous six books. Neville will continue to exhibit strength of character and magical power over the next few chapters, by helping to defend the castle and in recovering casualties. Harry's faith in Neville's abilities grows to where Harry will entrust Neville with a vital task: dispatching the final Horcrux, embedded in Voldemort's pet snake [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], in the event that he, Ron, or Hermione are unable to do the job. Neville will prove that he is up to the challenge.

Harry here determines that the Horcrux he is searching for, the last but one, is hidden within Rowena Ravenclaw's lost Diadem. He bases this guess on Voldemort's proclivity for using artifacts once belonging to the Hogwarts Founders as vessels for his other Horcruxes. While his guess remains unsure, several things will reinforce this belief, including Alecto Carrow's presence in the Ravenclaw common room; Alecto is there because Voldemort believed Harry would enter it if he returned to Hogwarts, and this supports Harry's belief that Voldemort used a Ravenclaw artifact. Over the next few chapters, Harry will discover what happened to that Diadem after it supposedly vanished, and how it made its way back to the school. He will also learn that he actually once held it in his hand a year earlier without realizing it.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

As soon as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]], a screeching alarm announces their presence. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], guessing that it is Harry, attempts to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] they are concealed under, but it fails to respond, keeping the Trio hidden. As they back down a side street, Hermione wants to Apparate out of Hogsmeade, but Harry says that protective spells have probably trapped them there. A sudden chill sweeps in and darkness starts enveloping everything around them: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], sensing their fear, close in. Unable to withstand their suffocating presence, Harry casts a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], scattering the Dementors, but revealing their location. A Death Eater yells that he has seen Harry's Patronus. A nearby door cracks open, and a harsh voice calls out, &quot;Potter, in here, quick!&quot; 

Dashing inside, the Trio find themselves in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]]. From an upstairs window, Harry recognizes the tall barkeeper talking to the Death Eaters outside as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus']] younger brother. Aberforth claims he accidentally set off the Caterwauling curfew alarm while putting his cat out and insists it was his goat Patronus; the Death Eaters initially disbelieve him, but, thrown off the trail, and not wanting to risk losing a convenient location to trade black market goods, decide to leave. Aberforth rebukes the Trio for risking their lives coming to Hogsmeade. Harry spots the twin to the mirror [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] gave him; Aberforth explains he bought it from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who stole it from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. Aberforth has been watching them with it. Harry recognizes Aberforth's eye as the one in the mirror shard and realizes that he sent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] to rescue them. Aberforth confirms it was him and is saddened to hear Dobby is dead.

Ron thinks Aberforth sent the doe Patronus, but Aberforth sarcastically reminds him that his Patronus is a goat. Aberforth suggests they wait until the Caterwauling alarm is turned off in the morning, then escape into the mountains. Harry insists they must get into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] castle because Dumbledore asked him to do something. Scoffs Aberforth, &quot;Did he now? Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?&quot; Ron and Hermione are obviously uncomfortable, and Harry remains silent, struggling with his own misgivings regarding Dumbledore, though he had already resolved to continue trusting him. Aberforth claims that others who trusted Dumbledore often suffered misfortune as a result. He urges the Trio to abandon their mission, believing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] is finished and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has won. It is time to save themselves. Against Harry's protests, Aberforth asks if Dumbledore had been honest and revealed the entire story to Harry. When Harry is unable to respond, Aberforth says that Dumbledore reveled in lies and secrecy, learning it at their mother's knee.

Hermione attempts to ease the tension by inquiring about Aberforth's sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], but this backfires when Aberforth brusquely asks if she has been reading [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book. Harry quickly changes the subject by mentioning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Elphias Doge|Elphias Doge]]. &quot;That old berk,&quot; sneers Aberforth. &quot;Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every orifice.&quot; Harry says nothing, still attempting to conceal his uncertainty. Aberforth reveals that Ariana, aged six, was injured by Muggle boys who observed her performing magic. She was never the same, eventually going half-mad and unable to control magic. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percival Dumbledore|Their father]] hunted down the boys in retaliation, but he never told the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] why he assaulted them, because, once revealed, Ariana would have been permanently committed to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. Instead, the family kept her hidden, fostering rumors she was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]]. With their father in prison, Aberforth and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|his mother, Kendra]] cared for Ariana as best they could. Aberforth was Ariana's favorite. Albus, involved with his studies and winning prizes, usually confined himself to his room when at home. One day, while Aberforth was out, Ariana flew into a rage. Unable to subdue Ariana's uncontrollable magic, Kendra was accidentally killed. Albus canceled his Grand Tour with Doge and returned home to care for Ariana and support the family while Aberforth finished his schooling. Aberforth claims Albus resented the responsibility that was forced upon him, though Aberforth had offered to relieve him. Then Albus met [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], a wizard he considered as brilliant as himself. The two quickly bonded, and, drawn by their mutual attraction to power and fame, hatched an elaborate scheme to create a new Wizarding order. When Aberforth learned about their grandiose plans, a three-way duel erupted; a stray curse killed Ariana. Aberforth claims Albus was glad his burden was gone, but Harry says he always carried it, recounting the night Albus died. After drinking the potion in the sea cave, Albus was raving, pleading with an unseen person not to hurt them. Harry is certain he was begging Grindelwald to spare his brother and sister, though Aberforth remains skeptical. 

Harry resolves to continue the mission. Knowing Voldemort could be killed, Dumbledore gave that knowledge to Harry. If Aberforth refuses to help sneak them into Hogwarts, then they will find their own way in. Relenting, Aberforth agrees to help and speaks to Ariana's portrait. She turns to leave, but rather than disappearing from the frame sideways as figures normally do, she instead turns and disappears down a long, dark passageway behind her. Aberforth explains that there is only one way into the castle now, the old secret passages are being guarded. Ariana soon returns accompanied by someone. As they reach the portrait, it swings open to reveal a tunnel; standing inside is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]].

== Analysis ==

For Harry, uncovering the truth about Albus Dumbledore has been a journey nearly as long and difficult as his quest to find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], and this truth has come in many pieces, from various sources, and over time, creating a complicated, and still unsolved, jigsaw puzzle. Searching for answers has tested and strained Harry's loyalty and faith in Dumbledore, causing him to question whether or not the man he loved and thought he knew and trusted, had ever loved him in return, and was the good person Harry believed him to be. Aberforth Dumbledore provides crucial information that helps Harry to better understand Albus' past behavior regarding his family. This has partially restored Harry's faith in Albus, but not entirely.

Until now, Aberforth has remained a curious and vague background figure, but his character becomes more defined here as he assumes a prominent role filling in the story's many gaps. Despite their physical resemblance, the two brothers have vastly differing talents, dispositions, and personalities. Albus' brilliance outshone his brother, but Aberforth's antagonism toward his elder brother was less about sibling rivalry and petty jealousy, than it was suppressed anger and deep-seated resentment over Albus' using his superior talents for pursuing his personal goals and accolades to shirk family responsibilities, letting the burden for Ariana's care fall upon Aberforth and their mother, Kendra. However, it is questionable whether the Dumbledores' decision, however well-intentioned, to keep Ariana hidden at home was ever a wise one. Ariana and the entire family might have fared far better if she had been placed in a structured setting, cared for by professional healers, rather than being hidden away. It is unclear if their decision was based on whether the quality of care at that time was sub-standard or if the stigma of having a severely handicapped child was simply too shameful for such a prominent family to bear, particularly following their patriarch's notoriety. Whatever their reasons, it eventually led to tragic circumstances and forced Albus to abandon, or at least postpone, his lofty ambitions to instead support his younger siblings. And while Aberforth's desire to care for his sister in his brother's stead may have been noble, Albus retained sufficient belief in education's importance that he refused Aberforth's request to leave Hogwarts so he could tend to their sister in Albus' place. Albus' bitter despair (and perhaps self-imposed martyrdom) over abandoning his goals may have been a factor in him falling prey to Grindelwald's Dark influence, though that hardly excuses Albus' behavior.

Albus and Aberforth maintained an amicable truce throughout their adult lives, but their suppressed emotions kept them aloof with one another, perhaps mutually fearing that spending too much time together would stir up old animosities or erupt into a violent debate over who actually killed their sister. Regardless whose curse fatally struck Ariana, each shared responsibility in her death by allowing their long-simmering hostilities to explode into an out-of-control confrontation, though Albus' brief foray into the Dark Arts with Grindelwald certainly played a more significant factor in the events leading up to the tragedy. Interestingly, though the brothers never grew close, they lived near one another, Albus at Hogwarts and Aberforth in Hogsmeade, sharing an occasional drink at the Hog's Head Inn. 

Albus' death has hardly softened Aberforth's feelings, however. When Harry says he is on Albus Dumbledore's mission, a sneering Aberforth mocks him (and Albus), causing Harry to recall his own doubts and concerns about Albus and forcing him to acknowledge that Aberforth's harsh words contain truth. Like Aberforth, readers must also be wondering why such a young, inexperienced, and unqualified wizard, even an immensely talented one like Harry, would have been given such a dangerous and seemingly impossible mission while being provided so little information. Harry resolves to remain loyal and trust Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to continuing the mission. He also attempts to convince Aberforth that Albus did indeed love his family and tried to protect them from Grindelwald. The pessimistic Aberforth remains skeptical, but he, perhaps surprisingly, sets aside his lingering animosity toward his brother, his capitulatory view regarding the war, as well as any doubts that Harry can succeed, and helps the Trio sneak into Hogwarts. 

While Aberforth has provided many answers about Albus and Grindelwald, his recollection differs from what Rita Skeeter, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], Elphias Doge, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Aunt Muriel]] claimed. And though Aberforth has provided an apparently factually accurate account about his family, his version should not be considered the conclusive one. Truth is often subjective and nebulous, and it is affected by others' opinions, personal experience, imperfect memories, individual bias, and raw emotions. Rarely is there a singular maxim, and all versions must be studied, weighed, and filtered before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. Even then, many will still disagree and instead believe only their own viewpoint. Although Aberforth has solved many mysteries, and filled in many missing pieces, he lacks all the facts and the puzzle remains incomplete&amp;mdash;there is still much more to be learned about Albus Dumbledore.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although Aberforth claims to believe that Voldemort has already won the war, it will be learned that, apart from his offering Harry a place to hide, he has been secretly helping the resurrected [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. It is unclear why he does this. He may simply be assisting the students because he is concerned for their safety, even though he believes they are fighting a lost cause. He does, however, participate in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], fighting within the school, actively defending it against Voldemort. Given this, it is entirely likely that Aberforth, in claiming that Voldemort has won, is, consciously or otherwise, testing Harry's mettle, trying to determine the depth of Harry's commitment to Albus' cause. This would also explain his immediate willingness to help once Harry declares that he will proceed with or without Aberforth's help. He may also realize that nothing will dissuade Harry from attempting to sneak into Hogwarts, and he therefore relents and provides the Trio the safest, and as far as he knows, only passage.

Examining the various stories about Albus Dumbledore, we see that Aberforth has the only consistent explanation about Albus' young life. Rita Skeeter based her embellished story on Bathilda Bagshot's fading memories, but Bathilda was, of necessity, outside the family, exactly the sort that Kendra would prevent knowing about Ariana's condition. Doge, possessing the same understanding, glossed over any parts that he found less than complimentary, and as a result became unconvincing, while the Weasleys' Auntie Muriel seems only to receive and pass on gossip and innuendo. And while each character provided some truth, their versions were, for the most part, faulty. However, we still fail to fully understand why Dumbledore and Grindelwald became so close, or why Dumbledore changed so radically following that episode. Our understanding will come when Harry meets with Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Waystation|Shade]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|what we are calling the waystation.]] There, we learn that Dumbledore believed Ariana's death was directly caused by his seeking power, and consequently resolved to never again attempt to gain power over others.

There actually is one other route left into Hogwarts, that being the tunnel from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]] that leads to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]. Harry, Hermione, and Ron will use this passage to get to the Shrieking Shack, where Voldemort is directing the battle, and will find it is guarded by only the Willow, as before. Aberforth knows nothing about this passage, nor does Neville, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] knows it exists, having actually traveled along it, once as a student, and later in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry's third year]]. It is never explained why Snape leaves this gap in Hogwarts' security perimeter standing open, though it is unlikely an oversight.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

The next morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is still mourning his lost [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wand]]. Without it he feels weak, vulnerable, and stripped naked, as if his magical power died with it. He tucks the broken halves, barely held together by the damaged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]] feather, into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Moke|Mokeskin]] pouch around his neck. The Snitch is also inside, and Harry is momentarily tempted to toss it, believing it is as useless as everything else [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] left behind. His fury at Dumbledore is unleashed. In desperation they had gone to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], believing it held answers and would lead to some secret path laid out by Dumbledore. Instead, they were left groping blindly, without a plan or a map, and it nearly took their lives. Now Harry is without a wand, without the Sword, and the dropped thief's photo has given [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] vital information.

Still upset, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] timidly brings Harry tea and shows him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Life and Lies|''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'']] that she took from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot's]] house. A note sticking out reads: ''Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here's a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don't remember it. Rita''

Harry assures Hermione that he is not angry about his wand, it was only an accident, and he is grateful to her for saving his life. As he rifles through the book, Harry feels perverse pleasure—now he will know Dumbledore's secrets. Harry sees photos of a young Dumbledore and the handsome companion he recognizes as the thief in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch's]] memory. The caption reads: ''Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother's death, with his friend [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]].''

Harry and Hermione exchange incredulous looks—Grindelwald! A chapter titled &quot;The Greater Good&quot;, reveals that Dumbledore graduated Hogwarts with many honors and accolades. He and his friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Elphias Doge|Elphias Doge]] cancelled a Grand Tour of Europe after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra Dumbledore]]'s sudden death. Although Doge had claimed that Dumbledore made a grand sacrifice to care for his family, the book implies otherwise, quoting several Godric's Hollow citizens. Enid Smeek recounts that Albus did little to curtail his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]]'s wild behavior and kept his sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], hidden away. Although the Dumbledores remained reclusive, Bathilda Bagshot reportedly established a friendship with the family. Skeeter claims that while Bathilda's memory may have been affected by age, she was able to extract enough facts to piece together the scandalous story of Kendra's death, which was passed off as a spell backfiring. She also debunks Ariana being sickly and claims Albus had an affinity for the Dark Arts and may have supported Muggle oppression.

The same summer Albus returned to care for the family, Bathilda Bagshot took in her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald, a student as brilliant as Dumbledore, who was expelled from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. He later became a notorious Dark wizard, though he was relatively unknown in Britain. He and Albus quickly bonded. In a letter to Gellert, Dumbledore writes that he agrees Wizard dominance over Muggles is for the greater good, but they must rule responsibly and only use force when necessary. He believes that was Gellert's mistake at Durmstrang, although he says that if Gellert had not been expelled, then they would never have met. Rita states that this letter proves that Albus Dumbledore once intended to overthrow the Statute of Secrecy and establish wizard rule over Muggles. It contradicts his later stance supporting Muggle-born witches and wizards and protecting Muggles' rights.

But barely two months after their friendship began, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted ways until their legendary duel. Bathilda Bagshot believed the rift involved Ariana's death. Gellert was present when it happened, and he came home distressed, leaving by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] the next day. Aberforth blamed Albus, and they came to blows at the funeral. It was never understood why Aberforth blamed Albus for Ariana's death, though it is speculated that it was related to Albus' friendship with Gellert, who had been expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks on fellow students. 

Gellert went on, some decades later, to head a reign of terror on the continent, eventually becoming the most feared Dark wizard in history at the time. Five years after Grindelwald's assumption of power, Dumbledore finally succumbed to the Wizarding world's pleas to end his vicious rampage in Europe. Questions lingered after Grindelwald's defeat, however. Was it Albus' affection for Grindelwald that delayed his taking action? How and why did Ariana die? Was it an accident or the first attempt at implementing their &quot;Greater Good&quot; plan?  

The chapter ends here, and Harry is stunned as he endures yet another loss: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], his Phoenix wand, and now his unwavering trust in Dumbledore, who once embodied nothing but goodness and wisdom. Hermione reminds him that Rita Skeeter is the author, but Harry points out Dumbledore's own words in his letter to Grindelwald. Hermione believes that Grindelwald's slogan, &quot;For the Greater Good&quot;, probably stemmed from Dumbledore's ideas and became Grindelwald's justification for his atrocities. Those words were reportedly carved over the entrance to &quot;Nurmengard&quot;, the prison that held Grindelwald's enemies. Hermione attributes Dumbledore's actions to his youth and losing his family, though Harry counters that they are the same age as he was, and are fighting Dark Arts, not championing them. Harry also points out that Albus had a brother and he kept his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]] sister locked up. Hermione doubts Ariana was a Squib, and insists the Dumbledore they knew would never have allowed Muggle oppression; whatever he believed at seventeen, he chose a different path as an adult and spent his remaining life fighting evil. Hermione surmises Harry is really angry because Dumbledore never revealed this about himself, which Harry acknowledges may be true. But he wonders how Dumbledore could have left him in such a mess, and if he ever really cared about him.

== Analysis ==

Not only was Godric's Hollow nearly fatal, but Harry and Hermione believe it was a useless dead-end, and Harry is angrier than ever with Dumbledore for having provided so little information for his quest. It is unclear if Dumbledore ever intended for them to go to Godric’s Hollow, but he must have surmised that Harry would visit his birthplace and would suspect information could be hidden there, though Dumbledore may have considered it too risky and obvious a place to secrete clues. Despite their miscalculation, the trip actually proves somewhat productive. As noted, Harry and Hermione come across the odd symbol on an old gravestone that is identical to the symbol inked into ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard,'' the book Dumbledore bequeathed to Hermione and the same as the one Xenophilius Lovegood wore at the wedding. Given Viktor Krum's strong reaction to seeing Lovegood wearing it, it would appear that this emblem may have some particularly important, and possibly Dark, meaning attached to it. The symbol's unknown relationship to &quot;Ignotus&quot;, the name on the gravestone, is also likely to be significant. Dumbledore may have intended for Harry to find the symbol here, lending further proof to its importance. 

Also, Hermione obtains Rita Skeeter's book, which provides valuable information about Dumbledore's past and his previously unknown association with the notorious Dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, who he eventually defeated in a duel. It should be noted that Grindelwald's rise to power on the Continent seems to have occurred during the Second World War, 1939 - 1945, while other evidence in the series dates the friendship of Grindelwald and Dumbledore to 1899. Grindelwald's photo in Bathilda's house also ties him to her and Godric's Hollow. Harry also confronts his own past in Godric's Hollow, and visiting his former home and his parents' graves provides some closure to this sad chapter in his life and will hopefully allow him eventually to move forward emotionally.  

Once again, Harry is deeply disappointed by someone he loved and admired. Before, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], had, in Harry's opinion, failed in some way. Now, it is Dumbledore. This time, however, Harry is not just disappointed, his faith and loyalty are nearly depleted, and Rita Skeeter seems to have proved his suspicions about Dumbledore. Curiously, despite Skeeter's sullied reputation for fabricating or sensationalizing facts, and Harry's own experience at being victimized by her libelous stories, he readily believes everything in her book. Even Dumbledore's own words seemingly lend credence to Skeeter's claims. Harry's belief may partially be spurred by this, as well as his anger and concerns about Dumbledore's true motives, further fueling Harry's faltering trust and doubts that Dumbledore ever loved him. But Harry fails to remember Dumbledore once telling him, &quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are.&quot; Hermione is likely correct that Harry is more upset that Dumbledore concealed his past from Harry, rather than by what he actually said or did. She points out that despite Dumbledore's early and short-lived flirtation with the Dark Arts and his attraction to its seductive power, that is not the man they knew him to be. Like James Potter, he chose to overcome his earlier flaws and dedicated his remaining life to fighting evil and Muggle oppression. Harry, still entrenched in his own youthful and somewhat naïve idealism, believes goodness and wisdom is a straight, one-way journey from birth throughout adulthood, and he fails to understand that it is often a route filled with roadblocks, detours, side streets, and occasional dark alleys. However far Dumbledore may have strayed from his own true path, he, unlike Grindelwald, found his way back again.

Harry mourning his lost wand shows he lacks confidence in himself and partially explains his displaced anger directed at Hermione. He believes it is his wand, rather than his own magical abilities, that provides his magical power. It is as if he has lost yet another loved one who provided guidance and strength. Like his owl, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], and, years earlier, his destroyed Nimbus 2000 [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomstick]], the wand provided comforting security and familiarity, as well as symbolizing his entry into the Wizarding world. He is correct, however, that this wand was special, and it apparently had developed unique powers and qualities that further tied him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and his yew wand, although these failed to protect it from Hermione's curse. Its loss is clearly a huge set-back to the mission, and while wizards can use other wands, not just any wand works well. Until Harry can obtain a suitable replacement, he must make do sharing Hermione's. And with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] apparently Voldemort's captive, procuring a new wand will be difficult.

It is noted above that Harry was particularly devastated when he lost his Nimbus 2000 broomstick. Curiously, his destroyed Firebolt, a gift from his late godfather, affected him less deeply. Other events such as Hedwig's death at the same time, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]]'s demise during the attack, and Sirius' and Dumbledore's recent murders may have overshadowed its significance to him. Also, it being a few years later, Harry's growing maturity has replaced his need to be overly attached and dependent upon inanimate objects for emotional security and to instead rely on friends and allies for support and comfort, though his broken wand is clearly an exception to that.

As a side note, readers perhaps noticed that J.K. Rowling may be employing some humor when Rita Skeeter informally addresses Bathilda Bagshot in her note as &quot;Batty.&quot; That, obviously, is a term for being mentally addled, which Bathilda apparently was in her later years, and probably is what allowed Skeeter to manipulate her into yielding her memories.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|a later chapter of this book]], we learn that Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|earlier comment]] to Harry, that it is one's choices that truly makes a person what they are, is based on the tragic events involving his own family that forever changed his personal path. While those words did comfort Harry when they were originally spoken, he has since had trouble applying them to anyone other than himself. We had seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 29|in an earlier book]] that Harry was dismayed to discover that his father (and Sirius) had been a bully, and that he had difficulty comprehending how such a dreadful youth could become the much-respected adult that everyone told him about. He did not understand then that his father had chosen to change, and fails to realize now that Dumbledore had equally made a conscious decision to become a different man, perhaps even better and stronger than if he had never dallied in Dark matters.

Grindelwald's symbol has now been seen three times: once around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]]'s neck at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|the wedding]], in the copy of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' that Dumbledore left to Hermione, and on the gravestone in Godric's Hollow. When Hermione, looking at ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'', reads quotes from Dumbledore's letter, she will discover that the young Albus used the same symbol in his signature. While it is known that Grindelwald used the symbol, we also learn it was in use long before his reign of terror, and that he co-opted it, much as the German National Socialist party co-opted the swastika. Having found the symbol now closely tied to Dumbledore, Hermione will be impelled to visit the one person they believe can explain its pre-Grindelwald meaning to them: Xeno Lovegood. In this, they will be assisted by the recently returned Ron, who knows roughly where the Lovegoods live.

Mature readers may find Dumbledore's letter, as revealed here, interesting, as it can be taken two ways. Rita Skeeter's interpretation is that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were planning to overthrow the body of laws governing Wizard and Muggle relations, with the intent to reveal wizards exist and to then head the new social order. Equally, however, it can be seen as the youthful planning of a wizard who has yet to discover that to accomplish anything you must work within the system, changing the existing structure slowly. Granted, it would take a wizard of rare power to bend a social structure that way, but Dumbledore had become just such a wizard. Before coming to this realization, however, he would have dreamed of rebuilding society more completely, as we see in the published letter, and he apparently failed to fully recognize that Grindelwald's methods of achieving their dream would have been far more extreme, and ultimately deadly. Eventually, Dumbledore was instrumental in gentling relations with Muggles to where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s Muggle protection laws could actually be enacted. However, being himself emotionally immature and still naive about society's nature, Harry is more likely to accept Skeeter's interpretation. Coupled with the above-mentioned inability to apply Dumbledore's aphorism about change, we can see that Harry will have lost immense trust in his own image of Dumbledore.

Following publication of the final book, the author has revealed in an interview that Dumbledore was homosexual. In the light of that awareness, we can see that the relationship between Grindelwald and Dumbledore was very likely more than friendship; on Dumbledore's side at least, it was likely infatuation, and that resulted in a certain amount of blindness to Grindelwald's more violent nature. It is perhaps a measure of the author's skill that the infatuation can be perceived in the one letter that we have seen, so that despite our having seen no previous signs of it, following publication of this letter, Dumbledore's sexual proclivities do not surprise us.

That Harry will acquire several different wands during his mission becomes important to the plot. He learns that under certain conditions, wands can change their allegiance. Mr. Ollivander's claim, that &quot;the wand chooses the wizard,&quot; is more important than Harry ever realized and it will affect his final confrontation with Voldemort. The returning Ron will provide Harry a replacement wand that while usable, never performs well for him.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] assumes that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], as she appears to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]], was sent by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]] to record the hearings. She tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|the Minister]] that with Mafalda recording, they can start right away. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] employee's wife is also being interrogated. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] watches as Hermione descends in the elevator with Umbridge. When Thicknesse asks what brings [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albert Runcorn|&quot;Albert&quot;]] to the first floor, Harry claims he needs to speak with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]].

Alone now, Harry dons the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and searches for Umbridge's office. Despite meticulously planning, the Trio apparently failed to consider they might become separated once inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Now Hermione is stuck in court proceedings while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] attempts to stop it raining in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]]'s office. Harry stumbles into an open area where employees are assembling anti-&quot;Mudblood&quot; pamphlets. Harry spots [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]]'s magical eye affixed to a door. Below, brass plaques read, ''Dolores Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister'' and ''Head of the Muggle-born Registration Commission''.

To create a diversion, Harry sets a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Decoy Detonator|Decoy Detonator]] free. It explodes, emitting a large, black smoke cloud. During the confusion, Harry enters Umbridge's office, finding it decorated exactly like her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] office, with the horribly cute kitten plates on the wall and lace doilies on the desks. Peering through the small telescope on the door, he sees everyone is gathered around the Decoy Detonator's remains. He removes Moody's eye, and pockets it, then tries unsuccessfully to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] the Locket.

A file on Arthur Weasley notes him as a pure-blood likely to be contacted by &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot;, Harry himself. Mr. Weasley is also being Tracked. Harry also finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter's]] book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Life and Lies|''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'']]. Inside is a photo of two teenagers, but before Harry can read the caption, Pius Thicknesse enters and leaves Umbridge a note. It seems unlikely the Locket is here and Harry returns, unseen, to the lift. He must now find Ron and collect Hermione from the courtroom. Luckily, Ron steps in on the second floor. The lift stops again and Mr. Weasley gets on. On the next floor, Ron exits, but Harry is blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] getting on, but realizing his father is there, gets out on the next floor. Mr. Weasley blocks Harry, claiming Runcorn planted information about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]]. When Harry warns Mr. Weasley that he is being Tracked, he believes it is a threat.

Covered with the Invisibility Cloak, Harry heads for the courtrooms to extract Hermione while Ron works on Yaxley's office. Harry recognizes an unnatural chill. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] are guarding Muggle-born witches and wizards waiting to be interrogated. Mary Cattermole is called. Inside the courtroom, two Dementors are kept at bay by a cat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], and Umbridge, Hermione (as Mafalda), and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]], are interrogating Cattermole, demanding to know whose wand she stole. Seeing the Locket around Umbridge's neck, Hermione compliments her about it. Umbridge claims the S initial is for Selwyn, an old Wizarding family she is honoured to be related to. This proves too much for Harry, who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Umbridge, and, before he can react, Yaxley. Harry releases the chains binding Mary, while Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Geminio|creates a duplicate]] Locket to replace the real one. Escorted by Harry and Hermione's Patronuses, the three exit the courtrooms. Gathering the other Muggle-borns, Harry says the new official position is to disguise themselves and leave the country or at least avoid the Ministry.

At the lifts, Ron warns them that the Ministry knows they are there and is closing off the fireplaces. They must hurry to escape. Harry sends the Muggle-borns through the remaining open fireplaces. Amidst the confusion, Yaxley appears, ordering workers to seal all fireplaces. As Ron escapes with Mary Cattermole, Yaxley fires a curse at Harry as he exits with Hermione. Back in the lavatory, Yaxley appears in the cubicle behind Harry. Grabbing Hermione and Ron, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]]. He briefly sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place's]] front door, then hears a bang, and they are Apparating away.

== Analysis ==

Once inside the Ministry, the Trio sees how extensively Voldemort's corruption and perversion has spread, and the extreme measures being implemented to separate the &quot;racially impure&quot; from &quot;pure-blooded&quot; wizard society. Anyone not directly serving Voldemort is controlled through his minions, mostly with threats and violence. It appears there is little resistance and as Voldemort gains more power, many wizards fear for themselves and/or their loved ones, who could be branded as traitors or &quot;undesirables&quot; and be incarcerated. There are still many in the general Wizarding population who are simply ignorant to what is happening, while others are fearful and/or uncertain what to believe or who to trust. Voldemort has deliberately crafted this confusion by quietly and insidiously seizing control of the Ministry and other key institutions while spreading anti-Muggle propaganda. He remains unseen; though his return has now been public knowledge for a year. remaining concealed allows rumour to do his work, spreading fear and doubt while never providing the public a specific target to rally against. We will see later that Voldemort is reported as being in several places simultaneously. Meanwhile, the thoroughly corrupt and reprehensible Dolores Umbridge revels in her position as Head of the Muggle-born Registration Committee. Bloated with power, she has dedicated herself to purging &quot;impurities&quot; from the Wizarding world, much as she did while at Hogwarts, and readily abuses her authority to persecute those deemed unworthy. From what can be seen at the hearing Umbridge is presiding over, it appears that all Muggle-borns are being rounded up, probably to be sent to a Wizard-style concentration camp for deportation, or worse, extermination. Though shielded to some extent by their Blood status, &quot;blood traitors&quot; are nonetheless being watched more closely as well.
 
Though the Trio successfully retrieved the Locket Horcrux, their lacking a back-up plan in the event they became separated while inside the Ministry is surprising. Randomly selecting individuals to impersonate without knowing their identities or rank, or considering that they may be called upon to perform their Ministry duties was also a careless and risky move. Hermione especially appears to have been rather lax in failing to anticipate this, considering her usual diligent attention to details and analyzing all likely scenarios. The Trio also was extremely lucky that Umbridge had the Locket with her on that particular day, an event that seems to have taken both Harry and Hermione somewhat by surprise. At this point, we can see that the mission's objectives were almost bizarrely ill-defined; while they had intended to try and learn where Umbridge might actually keep the Locket, there was no plan to deal with the possibility that it might be outside the Ministry, and so there was, for instance, no attempt to locate Umbridge's residence and then search for the Locket there. It also seems that this information could have been gathered by one person alone using the Invisibility Cloak rather than all three entering the Ministry in their Polyjuice Potion disguises. If that was the plan, it is curious then that Harry never searched for Umbridge's home address while he was in her office. Being that they still lacked vital information as to the Locket's whereabouts when they infiltrated the Ministry, it is also questionable as to why they put their plan into action on that particular day, though Harry seemed propelled more by an urgent need to act, rather than strategic timing. It is also unclear how the Trio positively identified the &quot;toad woman&quot; as being Dolores Umbridge before investing so much time and effort into planning their assault, though, fortunately, their hunch was correct.

Indeed, Hermione's entire plan seems unworthy, opting for a dangerously elaborate and overly complicated scheme when a simpler strategy may have been safer and more effective, and could have protected their secure hiding place. Rather than infiltrating the highly-secure Ministry, the Trio might have been able to intercept Umbridge (perhaps using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]]) before she entered or just after she left the Ministry. Also, once determining that Umbridge wears the Locket to work, one person alone could have slipped into her office under the Invisibility Cloak, stun her, perform a memory charm, and then removed and replaced the real Locket with a substitute, just as Hermione did. Like the Trio's reluctance to use extreme defensive tactics against their enemies, their unsophisticated plan and their rather erratic performance reflects their general inexperience and still growing maturity: they may still be unready to be full-fledged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] members. And though it is unlikely the Order would ever have allowed the Trio to undertake such a dangerous mission, Dumbledore apparently felt only they could accomplish this. However misbegotten, chaotic, and nearly disastrous the Ministry caper may have been, it was ultimately successful and fortuitously resulted in many innocent victims being rescued. It also shows that the Trio works well together and can quickly and calmly adapt to changing circumstances.

Retrieving Mad Eye Moody's magical eye from Umbridge's door was also a risky and impetuous decision by Harry, but his emotions overruled his logic, and he was simply unable to leave any part of Moody in Umbridge's possession. This also provides a necessary closure for Harry, allowing him to later bury at least a small portion of Mad Eye. One gathers that the eye's loss from the outer side of Umbridge's door will not hinder her spying on her subordinates; the eye, staring fixedly, seems to only provide camouflage for the small telescope inside the office door.

Harry glimpsing Dumbledore's image in what he momentarily believed was a mirror in Umbridge's office may be a subtle reference to the familiar-looking blue eye he has been seeing in the mirror-shard, though it is unknown yet whose eye this actually is. The original magic mirror, before it was broken, was described as about the size of a small book. It is probably the combination of its size, plus Harry's half-belief that the eye in the mirror-shard is Dumbledore's, that leads him to briefly mistake the book for a mirror.

Rowling's description that Umbridge's over-cute kitten decor appears just as it did at Hogwarts may be a subtle clue that, despite Umbridge's traumatic experience with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], readers can expect to see the same vile woman as in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.

As a side note: While Umbridge is not a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], her high position within the Ministry may occasionally place her in close contact with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Readers can only imagine his reaction had he noticed either the real or the fake Locket Horcrux dangling round her neck, particularly if she claimed it as a legacy of ''her'' family. Despite being a &quot;pure-blood&quot; advocate and staunchly loyal to the Ministry (and thus indirectly, if unknowingly) to the Dark Lord), her life would probably be forfeit. Voldemort, who would know that the substitute Locket she currently possesses is a fake, could likely trace this to Harry by connecting it to the Ministry raid. Much information could be extracted by Voldemort from Umbridge's memory that would lead him to Mundungus Fletcher, and, from there, to Grimmauld Place where the Locket was stolen, and thus to Harry. Voldemort could then surmise that Harry is hunting his other Horcruxes and that the real Locket Horcrux (and possibly the others) may have been destroyed, in addition to the Diary Horcrux. As this would jeopardize Harry's mission, we can only hope that Voldemort will leave the Ministry's daily operation to his minions.

Over the next several chapters, the Locket Horcrux begins to affect each Trio member as they take turns wearing it around their necks; it preys on them physically, mentally, and emotionally. When Ron puts his ear to the Locket, he is able to detect something akin to a &quot;heartbeat&quot; pulsing within it, indicating that it may share some of Voldemort's life force. The Horcrux may actually be somewhat sentient, as when Harry is trying to retrieve Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the Locket, the Horcrux, sensing danger, defends itself by attempting to strangle him. Also, once opened, it presents a shadow play designed to turn Ron, who is then holding the Sword, against Harry and Hermione, in the hopes of saving itself. Unlike the Trio, Dolores Umbridge seems unaffected by wearing the Locket, possibly because the Locket senses she poses no threat to its existence, and she may be more closely aligned to its Dark nature.

The Trio's foray into the Ministry of Magic, while ultimately successful, was nearly disastrous because they failed to consider all scenarios and lacked a back-up plan to handle even the simplest and most likely event: that they would be called upon to perform the duties of the Ministry employees they were impersonating and would thereby be separated. A far more sensible plan would be to first identify who they could best impersonate, then observe their duties and habits. In a later chapter, they will infiltrate another high-security Wizarding institution, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]]. While that mission will be successful, it also nearly ends in disaster, and they once again fail to have an alternate plan. They have to quickly improvise an alternate escape route when things go awry.

The two youths whose photo Harry briefly glimpsed in Rita Skeeter's book are the teen-aged Albus Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. Harry will see the photo again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 18|a later chapter]] and read not only the caption but the associated chapter of Skeeter's muck-raking book. As a result, Harry's already-shaken faith in Dumbledore will be eroded even further.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

As they depart the cemetery, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is positive she saw something move in the distance. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] thinks it may be a ghost, but Hermione draws her wand. Seeing dislodged snow by the bushes where Hermione was pointing, Harry surmises that if it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], they would be dead now. They put on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], glancing around as they leave. Heading down a street, they have no idea where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot’s]] house might be. They come upon an overgrown hedge surrounding a ruined cottage, most of which is still standing, but one side has been blown apart. On the gate, a sign appears: 

''On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]]. This house, invisible to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]], has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family.''

Messages from visitors are scribbled on the sign. Hermione thinks this is disrespectful, but it cheers Harry, who feels only gratitude. A mysterious, elderly woman approaches. Even though she is obviously a magical person, Harry is surprised and suspicious that she can see through the Invisibility Cloak. Harry asks if she is Bathilda Bagshot; she nods and leads them to a house with a garden as overgrown as the Potter residence. Inside, Harry whiffs a foul odor clinging to her, though it may be the house, which is covered by thick dust. Harry hears Bathilda calling, &quot;Come!&quot; from another room, causing Hermione to jump. Harry spots photographs atop a dresser and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tergeo|removes the dust]]. A half-dozen photos are missing from their ornate frames, but Harry recognizes a young blond man in one as the same person in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter’s]] book, ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. Despite Harry repeatedly asking who it is, Bathilda only vaguely stares at him, causing Harry to wonder how she was able to tell Rita Skeeter much about the Dumbledore clan. Harry tells Hermione that the man in the photo is the thief he saw in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] mind, who stole the item from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]].

Bathilda motions for only Harry to go upstairs with her; as he follows her, Harry pockets the thief's photo. Harry asks if she has something for him. Bathilda's eyes close, and Harry feels his scar prickle and the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] twitch against his chest as the room momentarily darkens. Joy surges through his body, and he hears his own voice saying, &quot;Hold him!&quot;  Harry inspects the dressing table that Bathilda points to, but turning, he witnesses a revolting sight: a huge snake pours from what was Bathilda's neck, her lifeless body collapsing to the floor. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] attacks, biting Harry's arm and sending his wand flying. The resulting noise brings Hermione frantically running upstairs. Releasing Harry, Nagini lunges at Hermione, barely missing her. Harry, grabbing his dropped wand, yells that Voldemort is coming. Nagini lunges again as Harry drags Hermione across the bed. Hermione casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confringo|Confringo]], and the spell ricochets around the room, burning Harry's hand, as they leap out the window. Voldemort, grasping at Harry, screams in fury as he and Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparate]]; his anger sears Harry's scar.

Pain mingles with Voldemort's memories of a cold, fateful night sixteen years before: Hallowe'en costumes, a father's smile, a toddler playing on the floor inside a cozy house. Outside, a gate creaks open as a dark figure strides through. A man yells, &quot;Lily, take Harry and go! It's him. Go! Run! I'll hold him off!&quot; More screams, then green flashes, and a woman's crumpled body lies upon the nursery floor. One final flash, and pain-shot darkness. &lt;!--Been meaning to mention this for a long time, but &quot;pain-shot darkness&quot; is excellent prose! -PNW Raven--&gt; Then, through Voldemort's eyes, Harry sees Bathilda's bedroom again as Voldemort retrieves the dropped photo of the thief. 

Hermione's voice pierces the void, pleading for him to awake. Opening his eyes, Harry sees he is inside the tent. It is hours after their escape and Harry has been ill; Hermione used the Hover charm to get him into his bunk and a Severing charm to pry the stuck Locket from his chest. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dittany|Dittany]] healed Nagini's bite wounds. While Harry relived Voldemort's memories, he was delirious, moaning and screaming. Harry relates how Nagini was hidden inside Bathilda's corpse, withholding the most gruesome details. Nagini only spoke to Harry when they were alone because it was in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. Nagini immediately summoned Voldemort when Harry identified himself. Harry asks for his wand, but Hermione tearfully confesses that it is broken, probably by her ricocheting spell. Stunned, Harry asks that she try repairing it with her wand, but like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|fractured wand]] that never worked the same, Harry's wand is too badly damaged, and it snaps in half again when he tests it. With [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] held captive by Voldemort, Harry is unsure how he will obtain another wand. Though clearly upset, Harry tells Hermione she is not to blame, then borrows her wand to take the watch, wanting to be away from her. Hermione sits by the bunk quietly sobbing.

== Analysis ==

Harry confronts death in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], but rather than witnessing it hot and fresh as when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] were killed, he now sees only its cold, decayed aftermath, dimming his hope to ever be reunited with his mother and father. Harry's own recollections of that tragic night are faint, limited to a green flash and his mother's screams. While inside Voldemort's memories, he was able to see the entire horrendous event as it unfolded through Voldemort's eyes. Not only does this reopen old wounds, it creates new ones that only intensify his grief and despair. But as painful as those memories are, they also provide him a clearer picture regarding what actually happened on that cold, long-ago night, tying him closer to his parents and clarifying his role in vanquishing the Dark Lord.

Visiting his parents' graves, and seeing the destroyed cottage in which he once lived, deeply disturbs Harry, driving home the reality that the tragic events sixteen years before were real. Until now, these were merely sad stories told to Harry, but seeing the graves and the house in person is emotionally wrenching, and it serves to fully integrate him into past events. And while Harry has always harbored a slim hope that magic would somehow reunite him with his dead parents, seeing their forlorn, final resting place forces him to confront death's finality and accept that the dead can only live on in this world through others' memories. Harry is comforted and uplifted, however, by the kind messages visitors have left at the Potter's residence over the years. 

Harry's difficult childhood has resulted in his never fully trusting or relying on others, and he usually prefers to confront most situations alone. He has made great strides in overcoming this trait, however, learning to accept friends' and mentors' support and guidance, though some, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Dumbledore, have also failed him. He takes a great leap of faith here when he willingly follows the mysterious elderly woman, believing she is Bathilda Bagshot and trusting that she can help. This time Harry's reasoning proves faulty. Even the decision to go to Godric's Hollow was driven more by a desire to see his birthplace, visit James and Lily's graves, and resolve his conflicted feelings about Dumbledore, rather than to uncover clues relating to their mission; the error nearly costs Harry and Hermione their lives. It is uncertain if Harry can ever show that much faith in the unknown again. It is also a little surprising that Hermione, who is usually far more cautious and suspicious than either Ron or Harry, not only suggested going to Godric's Hollow, but agreed to follow the old woman, despite her odd behavior. Hermione did express discomfort with the situation more than once, and so the most likely reason for her behavior is that she did not want to argue with Harry and upset him so soon after his emotional encounter with his parents' graves.

Readers can again see to what extremes the despicable Rita Skeeter will go to obtain information. She likely used some magical means, probably a memory charm or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], to extract the vulnerable Bathilda's faulty memories, then stole the photographs for her book. Skeeter may also be indirectly responsible for poor Bathilda's death, as Voldemort apparently surmised that Skeeter's book could lure Harry to Godric's Hollow and Bathilda to seek information, prompting Voldemort to murder her and set the trap that nearly ensnared Harry and probably would have killed Hermione. The elderly and frail Bathilda may also have succumbed to natural causes or died of shock when Voldemort appeared at her home, allowing Voldemort to simply take advantage of the situation. However, Skeeter's book is likely what drew his attention to Godric's Hollow.

Though Harry assures Hermione she is blameless for breaking his wand, he is clearly upset, leaving Hermione in tears and driving an invisible wedge between them. As with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 11|earlier]], Harry's immediate reaction is undeservedly harsh, especially considering Hermione risked her own life to save his. However, Harry, believing that his wand is his only hope against Voldemort, is devastated by its loss, and his logical thinking (and gratitude) has been temporarily displaced by anger and grief, though he quickly realizes Hermione was blameless. The wand's loss is a blow to the mission, but Harry may be more affected by losing a treasured object rather than a valuable weapon.

It is perhaps worth noting here that the conversation about Harry's broken wand is the first time either Harry or Hermione has spoken Ron's name since his departure; it may prove important.

It should also be mentioned that when Harry hears or speaks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]], he is unable to distinguish it from English. We first saw this when the boa constrictor at the zoo spoke to him in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], and explicitly as far back as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], where Harry had to imagine he was seeing a living snake before the words he spoke to the Chamber's entrance would emerge in Parseltongue. This explains why Harry was unaware anything was amiss when Nagini, disguised as Bathilda, called from the other room, while Hermione was suddenly startled. Harry heard &quot;Bathilda&quot; saying, &quot;Come&quot;, while all Hermione detected was a strange hissing noise.

Although Harry seriously erred in trusting the &quot;old woman&quot; he believed was Bathilda Bagshot, he will again put his trust in a stranger when one night soon a silvery doe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] appears, and he follows it in the hope an ally sent it to help. This time his assumption will be correct, and he will also be reunited with a valued friend.

In a later chapter, Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Waystation|shade]] will explain that even though Harry's wand had grown very powerful because it imbibed additional power from Voldemort's yew wand (brother to Harry's wand), that power can only be directed against Voldemort, regardless of what wand the Dark Lord may be wielding at the time. Against other wizards, Harry's wand had no greater advantage than before. That is why Hermione was able to accidentally destroy Harry's wand with her own.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] realizes they have successfully [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparated]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]]’s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|seaside cottage]], despite his uncertainty at takeoff. Bill reports that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is inside and is alright. Pulling the knife from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby's]] lifeless body, Harry then covers him with his jacket. As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] carries the injured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] into the cottage, Harry's scar prickles as he watches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] punishing those at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. 

Harry wants to bury Dobby himself, without magic, and uses only a spade to dig a grave in the garden. His scar burning, he subdues the pain and blocks out Voldemort’s thoughts with his grief&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. though, of course, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] would have called it &quot;love&quot;. His own thoughts turn to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] and the brief merciful act that cost him his life. Dumbledore foresaw that, but what else had he known? Harry resolves to only hunt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] as Dumbledore wanted, rather than also searching for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Dean return, carrying spades to help Harry dig. After clothing Dobby's body with shoes, socks, and a hat, they gently place him into the grave and bury him. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] suggests saying a few words, and each in turn gives thanks to the tiny [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|Elf]] who saved their lives. Harry places a large rock on the grave as a headstone and uses a wand to inscribe: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF

Harry is greatly relieved to hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] is no longer at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and that she and the other Weasleys are safely hidden at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel's]] house. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]] is likewise protected by charms. Bill says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] and Griphook can be moved to Muriel’s in about an hour, but Harry strongly objects. He must talk with them first.

Harry wonders how Dobby knew to rescue them. The blue eye in the mirror shard brings Dumbledore’s words back to him: ''Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'' Although Harry feels closer to understanding what Dumbledore intended for him to do, he still wonders. Dumbledore had given Ron the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]], knowing he would need a way back should he leave the mission. And he understood that there was regret within Wormtail. But what did Dumbledore know about him? Had he deliberately made everything so difficult to give Harry time to work everything out? 

Harry insists on speaking to Griphook and Ollivander, overruling Fleur’s and Bill's objections that they are too weak; Harry reminds Bill that he is an Order of the Phoenix member and knows that Harry is on a mission for Dumbledore.  

The Trio first meets with Griphook, who is clutching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor’s Sword]]. Griphook thinks Harry is an odd wizard for burying an Elf and rescuing a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]], though Harry is unsure if that is meant as praise or insult. Harry asks for Griphook's help to break into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts vault]], stunning Ron and Hermione. Griphook claims it is impossible, but Ron contradicts him, citing the break-in seven years ago; Griphook retorts that the vault was empty then. Harry assures Griphook he is not seeking personal gain. Slowly, Griphook agrees to consider it. The respect and protection Harry has shown Goblins and Elves has convinced him that Harry is probably the only wizard who would break into Gringotts for something other than its treasures. When Harry insists the issue is not Goblins versus wizards, Griphook points out that all magical creatures are suppressed under wizard rule and Elves are being slaughtered. Who amongst the wizards protests? Hermione says they do, and, as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Mudblood]], she holds no higher position than the Goblins and Elves under Voldemort's new order. Griphook asks what Harry seeks in the Lestrange’s vault, being as he has the genuine Gryffindor’s Sword; Harry responds only that the vault contains other objects. Griphook agrees to consider Harry's offer, but now wants to sleep.

Later, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]'s terrified reaction when she believed they were inside her vault has convinced him that a Horcrux is hidden there. Unlike Voldemort's other hiding places that were personally meaningful to him, Harry thinks he would envy anyone with a Gringotts vault, something only the oldest Wizarding families could have. Harry suspects Bellatrix and her husband are unaware they are storing Voldemort's Horcrux, just as he never revealed the truth about Tom Riddle's Diary to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. The safest place to hide anything, says Harry, is in Gringotts.

Ollivander declares that Harry's damaged wand is irreparable. He also identifies the two wands taken from Malfoy Manor. The first is Bellatrix’s walnut and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]] heartstring wand. Draco’s is a hawthorn and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorn]] hair wand, though it may no longer actually belong to Draco because Harry captured it. Ollivander explains how wands can transfer their allegiance&amp;mdash;the wand chooses the wizard. While a wizard can use almost any wand, it is less effective than his own. A conquered wand usually bends to its new master’s will, and this allegiance can be won without killing an opponent. Ollivander identifies the chestnut and Dragon heartstring wand as the one he was forced to make for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. It will serve Ron reasonably well if he captured it. Ollivander also explains about legendary wands passing ownership through murder; he believes there is really only one, and acknowledges that Voldemort is curious about it. Ollivander admits he was tortured into confessing that Voldemort's and Harry’s wands share twin cores. He advised Voldemort to use another wand against Harry, but Harry says his wand destroyed the other wand, surprising Ollivander; Harry’s wand did something unique. Voldemort will now seek a wand more powerful than Harry's. Harry believes that if the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prior Incantato|Prior Incantato spell]] is used on Hermione's confiscated wand, then Voldemort will know that her spell broke Harry's wand and she was unable to repair it. 

Ollivander confirms that Voldemort wants the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]], believing it can defeat Harry and make him invincible. However, the Elder Wand's master is always vulnerable to attack, and Ollivander believes the Elder Wand can pass ownership without murder; its bloody history grew because many fought and died to possess such a desirable object. Ollivander admits telling Voldemort that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] once had the Elder Wand, though Gregorovitch may have started that as a rumor to boost his business. Ollivander knows nothing about the Deathly Hallows or the Elder Wand's connection to them. 

Later, in the clifftop garden, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that Gregorovitch once possessed the Elder Wand, though it was stolen long ago by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]. Harry suddenly &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort approaching Hogwarts’ gate but continues talking. With the Elder Wand, Grindelwald became the most powerful Dark wizard of that time. Only Dumbledore could defeat him, and he captured the Elder Wand that is entombed with him at Hogwarts. Ron wants to go there, but Harry says they must only hunt Horcruxes, not Deathly Hallows. 

Everything suddenly grows dark and cool, then Harry sees a white marble tomb loom into view. Voldemort splits it open with his wand. Within lies Dumbledore’s shrouded body, the Elder Wand tucked under his folded arms. Voldemort wonders how Dumbledore could have believed the tomb would protect it. As he grasps the wand, sparks flare from its tip. It is ready to serve its new master.

== Analysis ==

Ollivander's comment that the Elder Wand's master must always fear attack is revealing, meaning that despite whoever wields the wand with its superior power, the wand alone does not make that wizard invincible, leaving him vulnerable enough to be conquered. We saw the same warning in the Tale of the Three Brothers, where the brother with the Elder Wand was murdered in his sleep the very night after he first used the wand in a duel. Harry realizes that If Grindelwald was the blond thief who stole the Elder Wand from Gregorovitch, and Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, that, even without killing him, the wand's allegiance must have shifted to Dumbledore. Considering Grindelwald's and the wand's combined power, it is a testament to Dumbledore's considerable magical abilities that he was victorious. It is also a testament to Dumbledore's humanity that he spared Grindelwald, allowing him to be permanently incarcerated for his heinous crimes, though Dumbledore's prior relationship with Grindelwald may have tempered his actions. However, that decision had a price: leaving Grindelwald alive left a trail leading directly to the Elder Wand. Harry correctly surmises that Voldemort now knows the Elder Wand exists, and he is likely seeking it; Harry later watches Voldemort at Hogwarts as he is about to retrieve it from Dumbledore's tomb. Seeing how easily Voldemort can retrieve the wand and knowing its power, we should perhaps wonder why Dumbledore never made other arrangements for its disposal following his death. Harry, meanwhile, now realizes that his obsession with the Deathly Hallows had endangered the mission. He abandons pursuing them to instead only focus on finding and destroying the Horcruxes, a decision he makes despite lingering doubts about Dumbledore.

Harry deeply mourns Dobby's death, and his choosing to dig the grave manually is, for him, a gesture showing respect, gratitude, and love. The House-elf was not only his protector, but also a valued friend who forfeited his life to save Harry and the others. Using magic to quickly and easily excavate a dirt hole would only have lessened Dobby's bravery and heroism in Harry's mind, and he feels a need to exert himself physically to affirm Dobby's sacrifice before laying his fallen friend to rest. Also, for Harry, who is overcome with emotion, the physical exertion helps alleviate his anguish and anxiety and affords him time to reflect calmly and rationally on recent events. Dobby's death, rather than inciting Harry's rage and vengeance, instead focuses him solely on defeating Voldemort. This tragedy and its aftermath have not only helped Harry gain much needed perspective regarding his mission, but it enables him to retake command. Harry also clothes Dobby's body, an act that honors him as a free elf, clothing symbolizing a House-elf's sovereignty. Harry further acknowledges Dobby's independence on his tombstone for all to see. Ron and Dean helping to dig the grave not only shows respect for and gratitude to Dobby, but also their solidarity with Harry. Luna leading the others in saying a few final words is probably a rare instance where wizards have ever paid tribute to a House-elf.

Harry choosing to dig Dobby's grave by hand seems to echo [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s digging a grave for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 22|an earlier book]]. It is certainly true that for Harry and Hagrid digging their respective friends' graves by hand is more respectful and emotionally healing than using magic. Quite possibly, Harry and Hagrid are not alone among wizards in feeling that using magic, with its effortless appearance, to bury someone is somehow less meaningful. Readers may have been taken aback by the unceremonious way [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] magically filled in Aragog's grave after the earlier incident, but we see here that Dobby's grave is similarly filled magically. From this, we conclude that Slughorn's action was standard practice, rather than possibly unseemly haste to get to the mead he had brought for the wake.

Griphook's tight hold on the Sword of Gryffindor should also be noted by us. Harry is asking Griphook to assist him in a supposedly impossible enterprise, and Griphook is reluctant. We might wonder if Griphook's price for that assistance could be the Sword, of which he seems very possessive. 

Also, Griphook's argument that Gringotts Bank is impenetrable, despite the earlier break-in in the ''Philosopher's Stone'', certainly seems weak. He may be attempting to dissuade Harry from pursuing his risky plan, or is downplaying the previous lapse in security. If the Trio succeeds, however, Gringotts will likely have to restructure their security systems to pacify nervous clients who are likely hiding many secrets within their vaults.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

By carefully examining Harry's questions to Mr. Ollivander, we can see that Harry is attempting to determine who is the Elder Wand's current master. Harry knows that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] forcibly removed the wand from Dumbledore's hand, and that it was unused before being placed inside the tomb with Dumbledore's corpse. Harry has already discovered that a wand that is borrowed or simply given to someone, as Ron did with the blackthorn wand he captured from a Snatcher and gave to Harry, usually works much less efficiently than the user's own wand. In fact, Ron, who captured it, was probably the blackthorn wand's actual master. Harry's questions seem intended to confirm that this theory about the Elder Wand is true. If it is, Voldemort will likely discover that the Elder Wand performs far less effectively than he anticipated. The opposing theory, that the Elder Wand only changes allegiance when its master is murdered, seems supported by its bloody history; however, Harry realizes that Dumbledore fully commanded the wand despite Grindelwald's remaining alive, and Grindelwald, in turn, did not have to kill Gregorovitch to gain the wand's full power. Although Ollivander does confirm this theory, Harry remains unsure, and over the next weeks while they are planning the assault on Gringotts and recovering from their injuries, Harry repeatedly wonders if he did the right thing, allowing Voldemort to claim the Elder Wand.

As a side note, one might wonder how Ron was able to use the wand that Harry had simply given him in Malfoy Manor. By sheer luck, that wand was Pettigrew's, which Ron had wrested away from him in the cellar. Though it had since been confiscated by Draco, it was surrendered by Ron rather than forcefully taken from him, and so Ron probably remained its new master. Harry pulling the wand away from Draco would have been less relevant to it, as Draco was never its master. 

Hermione complains later that Bellatrix Lestrange's wand performs poorly for her; this is because, being nearly unconscious from pain, she took no part in the multiple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament jinxes]] or possession struggles. Thus, that wand is now loyal to the last person who captured it, most likely Ron, who jinxed it from Bellatrix' hand. Knowing what he does now, Harry might be able to rectify that problem by having Hermione forcibly remove the wand from Ron's hand, though he does not. Possibly, his decision, conscious or otherwise, to withhold this solution may be partial retaliation for Hermione's comments regarding how Harry should be able to use the blackthorn wand; however, it is equally likely that it simply does not occur to him. Also, even if Harry did have Hermione forcibly take the wand from Ron, the wand might sense that such a deliberately orchestrated act was a bogus &quot;capture&quot;, and it would therefore remain under either Ron's, or possibly even Bellatrix', control.

This side excursion into wand lore becomes important in the final chapters. Dumbledore felt it was safe to be entombed with the Elder Wand because he had arranged that Snape would kill him at an opportune time. As Dumbledore would have never been defeated, dying by his own design, the Elder Wand's power would have died with Dumbledore. This could also partly be the reason why Dumbledore insisted on Snape killing him rather than someone else. However, the plan was foiled as the Elder Wand's allegiance was transferred to Draco Malfoy, who disarmed Dumbledore just prior to Snape killing him. The new owner has since been disarmed by another person, Harry, who, unknowingly, now commands the Elder Wand because he controls Draco's wand, the specific tool with which Draco disarmed Dumbledore. As Ollivander points out, it is forcibly capturing the wand, rather than murder, that alters its ownership. Although Voldemort physically possesses the Elder Wand, it is partly because he never won its allegiance that he is defeated by Harry in the final battle. Voldemort, who does not know that Dumbledore's death by Snape's hand was prearranged, and unaware of Draco's disarming of Dumbledore, believes that Snape is the master of the Elder Wand and will eventually kill Snape in his futile attempt to win the wand's allegiance.

On a separate topic, we will shortly see that Griphook agrees to help Harry break into Gringotts, but his price is the Sword of Gryffindor. Over the next few chapters, we learn that Goblin ideas about property are far different than wizards; Goblins believe an object's maker retains ownership, and what wizards consider a sale is, to Goblins, merely a long-term lease. As such, Auntie Muriel's Goblin-made tiara and the Sword of Gryffindor should, as far as the Goblins are concerned, have been returned to Goblins, possibly when the original owners died. As soon as Griphook states his price, we see that there will be difficulties. Harry will want to keep the one artifact he knows can destroy Horcruxes. Though Harry and Ron resolve to keep the Sword until the final Horcrux is destroyed, then turn it over to Griphook, this plan will be rendered moot when Griphook, Sword in hand, abandons the Trio in the Gringotts deep vaults. The Sword, assisted by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]], will have its own ideas regarding where it belongs, however.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] spends as much time as possible alone on the cliff tops. This is the first time an opportunity has arisen where, rather than deciding to act, he instead chooses to do nothing. Even to himself, his reasoning for not racing to Hogwarts to retrieve the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] grows weaker every time he considers it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s doubting is hardly helpful, and even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s support is confusing. Convinced now that the Elder Wand does exist, she believes the way it was retrieved, and the wand itself, are evil. Ron questions if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] is truly dead &amp;ndash; there is the silver doe and the eye in the mirror. If it is not Dumbledore's eye, then who sent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]? 

Later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] agrees to help Harry, even though it is betraying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]], but he wants payment: the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]]. The Sword, Griphook says, was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin-made]], therefore, it still belongs to Goblins. Griphook is affronted when Ron mentions there are other valuables in the vault he might want: he is not a thief. Griphook claims that Gryffindor stole the Sword from Ragnuk the First. Harry, Ron, and Hermione want time to consider Griphook's request.

Harry wonders if the Sword was stolen from the Goblins. Hermione says that wizard-written history books often gloss over what was inflicted on nonhuman races. Ron's suggestion that they swap the real Sword for the fake one is dismissed, as Griphook would immediately detect the replica. Offering an equal value item is proposed, but they have nothing to trade. Harry finally decides to offer the Sword to Griphook, but only after all the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] have been destroyed. Hermione dislikes this idea, it could take years. Harry agrees, but he does not have another plan.

Griphook agrees to Harry's carefully worded agreement. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Griphook spend the next several weeks planning the Gringotts' assault, during which Harry realizes he dislikes the Goblin, who seems uncaring and cheerful that other wizards might be injured. He also seems to enjoy making things difficult for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]. She is gladdened that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] will shortly move to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Aunt Muriel]]'s, and she can then juggle bedrooms. Harry tells her that he, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] are fine sleeping in the living room. Keeping Griphook happy is essential to the Trio's plans. He also informs Fleur that he, Ron, and Hermione will be leaving soon.

As Ollivander and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] are about to depart for Aunt Muriel's, Fleur asks Ollivander to deliver Muriel's borrowed tiara. Griphook, eying the tiara almost eagerly, mentions that it was made by Goblins; Bill responds it was paid for by wizards.

Bill returns shortly after, reporting that everything is fine at Muriel's, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] are running an owl order business from the back bedroom. As dinner ends, there is a loud bang at the door. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] identifies himself and announces that he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] are parents to a baby boy, named Ted after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Tonks' father]]. He asks Harry to be godfather, and Harry, stunned, accepts. The celebration goes through several bottles before Lupin departs.

Bill privately asks Harry if he has a deal with Griphook, warning him that Goblins have foreign ideas regarding ownership. They believe wizards are untrustworthy in matters regarding treasure, and that property stays with the maker, considering Goblin-made wares to be leased rather than purchased. Griphook evidently feels that Auntie Muriel's tiara should have been returned to the Goblins when the original owner died. Though Harry never admits he and Griphook have an agreement, he promises Bill to be careful, then returns to the celebration, which continues even after Lupin leaves.

== Analysis ==

Rowling has pointed out separately, in an interview, that Harry deciding for the first time '''not''' to act upon something is an important part of his maturation. He sees an avenue he can pursue that will thwart one aspect of Voldemort's scheme, but he instead chooses to simply watch and make other plans that will lead to a resolution he has been striving for since the story began. Always before, Harry had seen a clear, straight path &amp;ndash; going through the trap door, entering the Chamber, freeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], dueling Voldemort, flying to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], recovering a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] &amp;ndash; and has followed it. These rather linear actions created a familiar pattern, making Harry predictable to his enemies. Now there is a defined action that Harry can take, traveling to Hogwarts to prevent Voldemort from claiming the Elder Wand, but after careful consideration, he opts to ignore it.

Harry's agreement with Griphook is risky, and it is unclear if the Goblin can be trusted, though Griphook likely feels the same about Harry. It is obvious that the Goblin's only intent is to obtain Gryffindor's Sword, which he firmly believes belongs to Goblins, rather than helping to rid Voldemort from the wizarding world. As Hermione pointed out, the centuries of ill-treatment that Goblins and other non-human magical folks have endured under wizards has been glossed over in history books written by biased historians. Voldemort, meanwhile, has been actively recruiting non-human denizens, and Griphook and many other magical creatures may believe they could fare better, or at least no worse, under Voldemort's domination than they have had serving wizards, possibly resulting in them either supporting Voldemort or even adopting a neutral stance in order to conduct business as usual once the war has ended. This could be cause enough for Griphook to betray the Trio once the Horcrux is retrieved from the Lestrange vault. Harry likely suspects that Griphook may double-cross him, but he has little choice but to place his faith in him for now and follow through with their plan.

It should be noted that Griphook has personally been ill-treated by Voldemort's Snatchers and lieutenants, and is affronted by the Dark Lord's agents interfering in Gringotts' operations. One wonders why he resists Harry's efforts to fight Voldemort, demanding payment for what should result in more freedom if Harry succeeds. While this is left unanswered, Griphook seems fully in character. His mercenary nature would likely result in his exacting payment for any action he takes; that he is Harry's only hope to successfully enter Gringotts allows him to demand a higher price, which he does. He may also be anticipating that returning the Sword to Goblinkind will restore his prestige, possibly earning him a promotion within Gringotts or lead to other Goblin endeavors. And quite likely Griphook believes that Harry's effort is doomed to fail, and that even with Griphook's help, Voldemort will remain in power.

The rift between Harry and Lupin has finally been healed, and, partially due to Harry, Lupin realizes that not only is he a suitable husband and father, but a worthy human being and valuable [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] member, despite being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. His being a Werewolf has actually been a tremendous asset to the Order, allowing him to infiltrate, at great personal risk, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback's]] lycanthropic realm to gather valuable information. Lupin asking Harry to be godfather to his newborn son not only shows how deeply he cares for and respects Harry, but also that he and Tonks believe that Harry, being an orphan, is the most qualified person to guide and mentor baby Teddy should anything happen to them, though there is no certainty that any will survive. 

Although it is never explained, it seems odd that Fleur would ask Mr. Ollivander, rather than Bill, to return Aunt Muriel's tiara. The author may be directing the reader's attention to this type of object for a specific reason.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Like the cup of tea that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] left outside Harry's bedroom door in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 2|Chapter 2]], Rowling has guided the reader's attention to another seemingly insignificant object, a tiara, also known as a diadem. This would be the second tiara that has been pointed out to us, the other being the one on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]] statue at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Lovegoods']]. As we now believe, one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff's]] Cup. That would seem to indicate that Ravenclaw's Diadem is a likely candidate to be another Horcrux, though its whereabouts are still unknown.

As mentioned, Harry's discussions with Ollivander were designed to determine who currently has the Elder Wand's allegiance. Despite Ollivanders' explanation, Harry still doubts that Voldemort's control over the Elder Wand is incomplete, and he will continue to doubt this until he directly confronts the Dark Lord. Harry fears he has given Voldemort an unbeatable weapon, and interestingly, this worry's description completely overshadows, for most readers, determining its ownership. The ongoing debates with Griphook are important here, as they serve to distract Harry, and us, from considering the Elder Wand's true ownership, something that becomes critically important shortly. Harry's mind might be eased, somewhat, if he considers that while the Elder Wand is truly the most powerful wand, Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, who then commanded the Elder Wand. Obviously, while that wand may make its owner more powerful, it does not make him invincible.

This chapter's action mainly focuses on limning Griphook's character, setting the scene for his quick departure in Gringotts' subterranean caverns, bearing the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry comes to dislike Griphook, a feeling we readers are apt to echo by this chapter's end, and that Griphook likely feels about Harry. Because of this preliminary description, Griphook's sudden exit, while dismaying, is certainly true to his character.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Their plan is simple: accompany [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], disguised as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] by using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], can open her vault and retrieve the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. They have Bellatrix's wand that was captured at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], and strands of her hair for the Polyjuice Potion. Bellatrix's wand performs poorly for Hermione, however, worrying her, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s hawthorn wand works well for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. He suspects Hermione is having difficulty because she did not capture the wand's allegiance as he did with Draco's. Harry, eager to leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], frets over how to prevent Griphook from keeping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]] after breaching the Lestrange vault.

Harry informs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] that they are leaving early, and requests Bill not see them off; with Hermione in disguise, Harry wants to prevent him from guessing their plan. Before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparating out]], Harry sadly glimpses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]'s grave and wonders how the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] knew to save them. Hermione is so convincing in her Bellatrix disguise, that Harry shivers with loathing. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], also disguised, grouses about his appearance. Harry, with Griphook on his shoulders, will be hidden under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]].

Inside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], they are taken aback by the changes. Dark Arts shops now line the street while many familiar stores have been boarded over. Witches and wizards whose wands have been confiscated beg in the street, and Harry's &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot; wanted posters are everywhere. Their plan proceeds reasonably well. Hermione makes a convincing Bellatrix, though Harry warns her against being too polite to subordinates. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], approaches and addresses &quot;Bellatrix&quot;. He is surprised Bellatrix is outside Malfoy Manor after hearing everyone there had been confined to the house and that Bellatrix's wand was lost. Hermione dismisses his comment by responding that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]] shows mercy to those who have served him well. Travers' suspicions seem eased, and he accompanies the group to Gringotts. Two human guards there have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Probity Probe|Probity Probes]] that detect concealment charms. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunds]] them and Hermione passes unchecked, though their apparent confusion causes Travers a moment's pause. Inside, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblins]] request Bellatrix's identification. When Hermione hesitates, one nervously says that her wand is sufficient proof, though she claims it is new. Harry suspects the Goblins know that Bellatrix's wand was stolen and are looking for an impostor. Griphook suggests using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] on the Goblin, Bogrod, who then accepts this wand as being correct. Harry also puts Travers under the curse when he becomes suspicious, knowing there are no wandmakers available. Bogrod requests the Clankers, then leads Hermione and Ron, with Harry, Griphook, and Travers into a passageway. The door slams shut, and Harry sends Travers away to hide. Bogrod, still under the Imperius curse, summons a cart that descends deep within Gringotts. After many twists and turns, the cart passes through a security waterfall that washes away all illusion charms. When the cart overturns and dumps them out, Hermione and Ron are themselves. Griphook believes the other Goblins know they are impostors, but Harry wants to continue and curses Bogrod again. 

The Lestrange vault is guarded by an aged, half-blind [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]] that Griphook subdues by using the Clankers. Harry guesses that the cowering Dragon associates the Clanker noise with pain. Hearing pursuit approaching, Harry forces Bogrod to open the vault, which is filled with precious objects. The vault closes behind them. Griphook says Bogrod can release them, but they must search quickly. Hermione screams in pain. The vault's protective charm causes the contents to start [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|multiplying]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrante|become searing hot]] every time something is touched. Harry spots Hufflepuff’s Cup, but it is out of reach. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Levicorpus|levitates]] Harry, and he snags the Cup with Gryffindor's Sword, while Hermione, Ron, Griphook, and Bogrod struggle to stay above the hot multiplying objects below. As Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Liberacorpus|sets himself down]], he drops the Sword and the Cup. Griphook grabs Gryffindor's Sword, and flips Hufflepuff's Cup up into the air. Harry catches it, ignoring the searing heat. Borne by a treasure avalanche spilling from the now-opened vault, Griphook runs off clutching Gryffindor's Sword, yelling that thieves are in the vault. Harry, Hermione, and Ron hurl curses at the Goblin throng. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Relashio|releases]] the half-blind Dragon and the three jump on its back. The freed Dragon takes flight, the Trio blasting holes into the ceiling for it to fly through as they make their escape.

== Analysis ==

Although the Trio and Griphook spent much time carefully planning the Gringotts break-in, it may not have been as well thought-out as they believed, which is surprising considering their near-disastrous experience at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. It should have occurred to them after witnessing Bellatrix's extreme reaction over the Lestrange vault, that Gringotts could have been alerted about a possible attempt to breach it, and that Harry has Bellatrix's captured wand. It is possible that Griphook, distrusting Harry's agreement, which Harry never intended to immediately honour, may have planned on the Trio being caught so he could reclaim Gryffindor's Sword for Goblins. Although there is no definitive proof for this, he apparently knew what security measures were in place, and should have been able to advise the Trio on how to avert them. The caper also placed a heavy burden on Hermione, who had to convincingly portray Bellatrix. Despite executing the deception relatively well, it is likely that Gringotts may have been tipped off.

As they arrive in Diagon Alley, the Trio, who have remained relatively isolated from the magical community, now see the direct result that Voldemort's take-over has had on the Wizarding world. Many familiar stores are gone, boarded up, or have been replaced by Dark Arts shops that probably were in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Muggle-borns, homeless and their wands confiscated, have been reduced to begging in the streets.

It almost seems that Harry's quest has reached a dead-end. Of the six [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] that he believes to exist, three (Riddle's Diary, the Gaunt Ring, and Slytherin's Locket) have been destroyed. He has found a fourth, but has lost the means to destroy it, and while he believes that the fifth may be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], he has no idea what the final one is, or where it is hidden. How shall he proceed?

Also, readers may remember Travers as one of the Death Eaters who appeared at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s house when Xeno alerted the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Voldemort-controlled Ministry of Magic]] that Harry, Hermione, and Ron had arrived there. The Trio likely never recognized him, probably only briefly glimpsing him while they were escaping the Lovegood house. Travers was also mentioned when the Trio were infiltrating the Ministry; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry  Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] assumed that Travers had sent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]] to be her recorder, thus taking Hermione, who was disguised as her, away for what promised to be a full day in court.

As we know, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] venom destroys Horcruxes. With the Sword of Gryffindor now no longer available, Harry may have to go to the only place that the venom exists: the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] beneath [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. As it turns out, there will be a more compelling reason for Harry to return to Hogwarts; Voldemort, enraged when he discovers that a Horcrux has been stolen, will shortly visit all his Horcruxes to reassure himself they are safe, and Harry, tuned into Voldemort's thoughts, will learn that one Horcrux is hidden at Hogwarts, as he had long suspected. Thus, he will be forced to visit the school in any event. At the moment, though, Harry is more interested in collecting Horcruxes than destroying them; we will see that he does not even consider how to destroy the Cup Horcrux, being more concerned with preventing Voldemort from reaching the one at Hogwarts.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

With no way to steer the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] can merely hang on, hoping for an opportunity to land safely. Fortunately, the beast seems unaware they are aboard. They tightly clutch the Dragon's scales, but if it banks or rolls over, they will fall off. The Dragon continues flying north, seemingly knowing where it is headed, despite being half-blind. Harry wonders if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has been informed yet that the Lestrange vault was breached. When he is, Voldemort will know Harry is hunting his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] and may have located others.

After some hours, the Dragon descends and glides over a small lake for a drink. The Trio jumps into the water, making it safely ashore through the reeds. Harry immediately casts protective charms, and they change into dry clothes and tend their burn wounds with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dittany|Dittany]]. Although they have successfully retrieved Hufflepuff's Cup, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]] is lost, rendering them powerless to destroy the remaining Horcruxes. As Ron grumbles over [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] double-crossing them, pain suddenly streaks across Harry's forehead. He sees a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]] cowering on his knees before Voldemort while wizards in a semi-circle look on. Voldemort screams in rage when the Goblin reports the Potter boy and his two accomplices took the Cup. Slashing the air with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]], the Dark Lord slays the Goblin. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and the other wizards dart from the room in terror&amp;mdash; anyone left behind is fatally felled. Voldemort wonders if Harry knows what the other Horcruxes are, and if he, Voldemort, can feel when they are being destroyed. Voldemort knows the Diary Horcrux was lost, but believes he was unable to detect it because he still lacked a body then. He suspects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] was involved; Dumbledore never trusted him. Voldemort is confident, however, that the Ring Horcrux remains intact&amp;mdash;no one ever connected him to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Gaunts]], after all. And the sea cave is too well protected for anyone to penetrate its security, therefore the Locket inside it must still be safe. He will go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to check on the one there; but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] must stay with him, must stay safe. But Dumbledore might have known his middle name and made that connection, he will check that one first. Then to the cave; that one is surely safe, still it must be checked. And finally, the one at Hogwarts, though it is also certainly safe, nobody else knows about that place.

Harry opens his eyes to Ron and Hermione peering down at him. Harry says Voldemort knows they are hunting his Horcruxes and that the last one is hidden somewhere at Hogwarts. Harry, though unaware what it is, knows Voldemort is heading there to check on it, but believes it is the safest one because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] is there. Harry decides they will go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], then slip into Hogwarts. Covering themselves with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], they [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] to the small village.

== Analysis ==

As the plot heads towards its conclusion, the Trio races to Hogwarts to find the last Horcrux, though they have no idea what it is and, having lost Gryffindor's Sword, are unable to destroy it and the others. As a reminder, Dumbledore told Harry that he believed there were six Horcruxes: the Diary, the Ring, and the Locket, all now destroyed; the Cup, probably Nagini, and one other. Harry now has evidence that the unknown one is hidden somewhere in Hogwarts, in a place that Voldemort believes no one else knows exists.

Meanwhile, Voldemort's supreme over-confidence in himself has begun to crumble after Harry and company successfully steal Hufflepuff's Cup from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]]. Despite his elaborate planning and extensive security measures, clearly his Horcruxes are vulnerable to being identified or destroyed, though Voldemort believes only the Diary has been eliminated. Although Dumbledore was the only one he ever feared, Voldemort's belief that he is the superior wizard has deluded him into a false sense of invincibility, now that Dumbledore is dead. However, underlying fears and insecurities now appear to be eroding what little sanity Voldemort still retains, causing him to frequently fly into uncontrollable rages and randomly lash out, often fatally, at any follower unfortunate enough to be within striking distance. Voldemort may now realize that he underestimated Dumbledore's ability to uncover and foil his plans, as well as Harry's resourcefulness in identifying and locating the remaining Horcruxes. 

To cope, Voldemort lulls himself into believing that he can &quot;feel&quot; when his Horcruxes are destroyed and takes comfort with the false notion that he was unable to detect the Riddle Diary Horcrux being destroyed only because he still lacked a body then. However, he remains ignorant that the Horcruxes within Gaunt's Ring and Slytherin's Locket no longer exist, or that Harry now knows what, or at least where, the remaining Horcruxes are. However, when Voldemort finally does realize this, it will place him on a deadly and irreversible collision course with Harry.

On an unrelated note, while the Trio are riding the Dragon, they are in danger of falling off and must wait until the beast descends before dismounting. Readers may wonder if they could simply have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparated]] to safety while astride it. While there may have been some magical obstacle, this either never occurred to them or, Apparition, requiring that the practitioner turn in place, may be too difficult in such a situation. That necessary &quot;deliberation&quot; step would be impossible while the Trio are holding on for dear life. However, it does appear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|in an earlier chapter]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] is able to Disapparate while similarly beset, though his criminal life has no doubt enabled him to make speedy escapes from difficult corners something he had to learn, and is therefore a skill the Trio lacks.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry has identified nearly all the Horcruxes, but he is still unaware that he carries a soul fragment, that will act similarly to a Horcrux, within himself. Voldemort also fails to realize this, as it was accidentally created during his attempt to kill baby Harry with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]] that rebounded and struck Voldemort instead. The murder attempt sheared off yet another fragment from Voldemort's soul, and because Voldemort's own soul had been ripped from his body, the soul shard instead attached to Harry. Voldemort's snake, Nagini, is also a Horcrux, as Dumbledore suspected; this is never explicitly stated, but it is certainly implied by Voldemort's decision to keep the snake close at hand and protected (as we will shortly see) where Voldemort can defend her.

The place at Hogwarts that Voldemort believes only he has discovered is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], which, of course, is known to Harry and the many [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] members. This is yet another example of Voldemort's supreme over-confidence; having found the Room of Requirement, likely by accident, and possibly while pacing the halls looking for a place to hide some Dark experiment, Voldemort assumes he is the only wizard smart enough to have discovered it. He seems to retain this view despite the overwhelming evidence of a millennium's accumulated junk in the room when he first entered it, though perhaps he assumed the room had lain forgotten for centuries, or else that the accumulated detritus had somehow migrated there by an automatic process of the castle. Also, after being instructed by Voldemort on how to locate and enter this room, it would certainly seem that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] should have realized that it was the Room of Requirement, and that he would have mentioned something to Voldemort about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] once meeting there, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s Inquisitorial Squad, of which Draco was a member, had raided it. Draco may have realized this, but, fearing for his and his family's lives, obediently listened to Voldemort's instructions in silence, or he may have been unaware that Voldemort believed he was the only person who knew the room existed.Draco may also have subconsciously been hoping that his secret activities in the room would be discovered, thus preventing Draco from having to carry out Voldemort's plan to murder Dumbledore.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Pain explodes in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s scar, and he finds himself on a rocky outcrop under a cliff. ''Good,'' he thinks, ''they have the boy.'' A loud crack brings Harry back to himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] stuns [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]]. The noise awakens the Ravenclaw students, and Harry dives back under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] with Luna. Students begin milling about, frightened by finding the unconscious teacher on the floor. Outside, in the hall, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus]], is frantically calling for Alecto, worried that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]] has been summoned without Harry Potter having been captured. Amycus is heard ordering [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] to open the door. Inside the common room, they find the unconscious Alecto. McGonagall is surprised that Harry Potter may be there and that the Dark Lord suspects he might attempt to break into Ravenclaw Tower. Amycus, fearing Voldemort's wrath if Harry escapes, says he will pass off the alert as a school prank and punish a few students. When McGonagall objects, Amycus threatens her. Harry steps out and slams him with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]], lifting Amycus' writhing body into the air and crashing it through a bookcase. Harry understands now what [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] had meant when she once said a person must actually mean it for an Unforgivable Curse to work. An astonished McGonagall thanks Harry for his gallant effort but urges him to flee the castle quickly. He refuses, saying there is something he must do. He asks about the Diadem, but McGonagall says it has been lost for centuries. Harry is stymied; the Diadem was his most likely candidate for the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], and nobody knows where it is. Amycus stirs, and McGonagall casts a binding spell on him and his still unconscious sister. Voldemort's rage overtakes Harry&amp;mdash;the Dark Lord has discovered the Locket is missing from the sea cave. Returning to himself, Harry updates Professor McGonagall and says he must find something hidden in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] before Voldemort and his forces arrive. McGonagall replies that she and the staff will defend the castle for as long as possible while Harry searches. Harry tells McGonagall that students can be evacuated through the tunnel to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head Inn]]. Voldemort will only be concentrating on Hogwarts, not [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparating]] students in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade village]].

Harry and Luna hide under the Invisibility Cloak as McGonagall casts three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|cat Patronuses]] to summon the other Heads of House. They run into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] in the hall. He continually darts his eyes about, perhaps detecting Harry there. When asked what she is doing there, McGonagall claims she heard a disturbance. She is evasive when asked about Harry, then slashes her wand. Snape, quicker, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|deflects her charm]]. They duel fiercely, magic so quick Harry has never seen the like. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Sprout]] come running to McGonagall's aid with a huffing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] lagging behind. Outnumbered, Snape dashes into a deserted classroom where a loud crash is heard. Pursuing, McGonagall screams, ''&quot;Coward!&quot;'' Uncloaked, Harry and Luna rush inside, startling the other professors. Snape has leaped out the window. Harry thinks he must be dead, but McGonagall bitterly comments that, unlike [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], Snape had a wand and has learned a few tricks from &quot;You-Know-Who&quot;. Harry sees a large, bat-like figure soaring across the school grounds. Slughorn finally enters, and McGonagall informs him that Snape is taking a &quot;leave of absence.&quot; Harry slides into Voldemort's mind again and sees an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]]-filled lake. Voldemort leaps from the boat in a murderous rage — he is headed for Hogwarts. 

McGonagall orders students to be sent to the Great Hall, then tells Slughorn the time has come for Slytherin to choose sides. The professors set defensive charms and spells around Hogwarts, though they cannot fend off Voldemort indefinitely. Harry asks Flitwick if he might know where Ravenclaw's Diadem is, but Flitwick says no one in living memory has seen it. McGonagall enchants the school's statues and suits of armour to help defend the castle and orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], who is ranting about students being out of bed, to summon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves the Poltergeist]].

When Harry and Luna return to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], Harry is shocked and dismayed that even more people have arrived, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Shacklebolt]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alicia Spinnet|Alicia Spinnet]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr.]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] alerted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], and they in turn summoned the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. As younger students are being evacuated, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], who wants to fight, is arguing with her parents to stay. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] suddenly arrives and loudly apologizes to his family for being a deluded idiot and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] pawn; the Weasleys immediately forgive him. Looking around, Harry wonders where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are. Ginny, who has been ordered to remain inside the room during the battle, says they are attending to something having to do with a bathroom, leaving Harry puzzled. His scar sears again, and he is gazing at Hogwarts through huge iron gates. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] is draped around his shoulders. Voldemort has arrived.

== Analysis ==

As the story reaches a critical stage, time is running out; Harry is desperate to find the Ravenclaw Horcrux, and Hufflepuff's Cup must still be destroyed, though Harry still has no idea how to eliminate either Horcrux. Ron and Hermione, however, may have some idea regarding this, which might explain their sudden and mysterious absence. Voldemort and his forces will soon arrive at the castle, and Harry is at a loss as to where to search or if the Diadem is even the actual Horcrux. The final Horcrux being hidden at Hogwarts is fortuitous; it is a place Harry knows better than anywhere else, and at least as well as Voldemort does. Probably only Dumbledore and the Weasley twins know it better.  This homecoming also infuses Harry with a much needed boost of strength and confidence that a less familiar locale would be unable to provide. And though Harry has no idea where the Diadem might be hidden, if it is at Hogwarts, his knowing many castle secrets will help narrow the search. Also, Harry's return not only puts him in a familiar and comforting setting, but it reconnects his alliances with old friends and other supporters, who immediately flock to Hogwarts upon hearing he has arrived. If Harry is to succeed, he must rely on everyone's help. We see, however, Harry's dismay when the Order of the Phoenix arrives; again, he feels that he is endangering his friends, unable to see that they are at risk in any event. Harry fails to realize that he has little responsibility or control for his friends' arrival, merely being the banner which people choose to follow. This is their battle as much as it is his.

Although Harry has used the Cruciatus curse before, this is the first time it has worked effectively for him. He recalls Bellatrix Lestrange once telling him that the conjurer must actually mean it in order for an Unforgivable curse to work properly, that righteous indignation is not enough. Previously, Harry only halfheartedly cast the Cruciatus curse (on Bellatrix Lestrange), unwilling to inflict pain and suffering on anyone, even a hated enemy. Now, however, Harry uses it to protect someone he cares about. And considering its effect on Amycus Carrow, this time, Harry obviously meant it.

Knowing Snape's skill at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]], it is hardly surprising that he seems to be looking around for Harry. Snape likely perceived Harry's presence under the Invisibility Cloak. This skill likewise may be helping him deflect the magic McGonagall is throwing at him, though it is equally possible that McGonagall, knowing his ability, is using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]], as much as she is able to, to block Snape's probes. We have no way of knowing how skilled McGonagall is in this particular branch of magic.

Some readers, sharing the Twins' views, may have felt that the Weasley family was better off with Percy having chosen his own course; others, echoing Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, may have been dismayed at his estrangement. Most will, however, be pleased by his reunion with his family, particularly since he seems to have acknowledged Fred's pungent analysis regarding his recent behavior. The reunion's timing is probably chosen to avoid the heartbreaking spectacle of brother fighting brother, while retaining the suspense surrounding Percy's having inadvertently chosen the Dark side heightened to the last possible moment. Percy's estrangement was a minor side plot, but it clearly needed resolution before the family was completely torn apart, and this seems an appropriate way to resolve it.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The bathroom Ginny Weasley is referring to is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle's]] lavatory, which readers should remember contains the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets and that only someone speaking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]] can open. It is unknown yet why Ron and Hermione would have gone there, or if they could open the Chamber, but this will play a significant role in the next chapter.

Snape's behavior when questioning McGonagall in the hallway, as discussed above, strongly indicates that he knows Harry is nearby, hidden under his Invisibility Cloak. Snape, of course, should be able to detect Harry using Legilimency. It is still unknown, however, that Snape is Dumbledore's secret ally, and he would do nothing to interfere with Harry's mission. In light of this, it is probable that during his and McGonagall's fierce duel, even though both are powerful wizards and skilled duelists, and McGonagall would probably kill him if she could, Snape is defending himself while doing nothing that would harm her or Harry, finally fleeing before the encounter turns deadly. 

Professor Flitwick's comment that no one in living memory has seen Ravenclaw's Diadem will prove to be untrue, as it has actually been seen quite recently, though without either we or the person holding it knowing what it was at the time. However, Flitwick's words will act as a useful trigger for Harry, setting a train of thought in motion that results in Harry finding the Diadem.

A very interesting point is touched on by one editor: how can the students Disapparate from Hogsmeade? For that matter, how can Dumbledore's Army members Apparate in, as they have been doing? Aberforth has said that Harry, Ron, and Hermione should wait until dawn, and then Apparate away and hide in the mountains. While he never explicitly says so, he strongly implies that Apparating out of Hogsmeade is impossible. In this case, perhaps, Harry may simply have made a lucky assumption. Clearly it is possible to Apparate into Hogsmeade, as he has done so. Perhaps he simply assumed that it would be similarly possible to Apparate out, and missed Aberforth saying that it could not be done. As the author never tells us, we can only speculate; but it is possible that when the evacuation starts, Voldemort has already lifted the anti-Apparition spells on Hogsmeade to allow his troops free movement. If so, this is a major stroke of luck for the Hogwarts forces; they would have been unable to evacuate the non-combatants otherwise. Also, just as Voldemort and his forces are able to eventually penetrate Hogwarts' defenses, it may be possible that with sufficient numbers, and the need for concealment no longer in force, the Order of the Phoenix is able to break Voldemort's protective spells.

A similar question that arises is, what about those students who are still unable to Apparate? There are wizards, we are told, who never Apparate, despite being fully grown or qualified, because of the Splinching risk. So quite possibly, in order to accommodate those Death Eaters who were unwilling or unable to Apparate, Voldemort might also have released any restrictions on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]]. This, then, could be used in conjunction with side-along Apparition, and possibly emergency [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]] delivered to the evacuation site to transport students.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}
The enchanted ceiling in the Great Hall is dark with twinkling stars; the students are sitting below, clothed in their dressing gowns or traveling cloaks. Every [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] being, living or dead, is listening to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]: students will be evacuated before the battle begins, though the older students can remain and fight. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order]] and the professors have agreed upon a battle plan and begin dividing into groups. As tension mounts over the approaching battle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] anxiously searches the room for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who are still missing. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] booming voice, seemingly from nowhere, demands that, to save the school, Harry Potter must surrender by midnight. Pointing at Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]], a Slytherin, yells for someone to grab him. Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw students leap up, aiming their wands at Slytherin's table. McGonagall then orders all Slytherins to leave, followed by the other Houses, though many older students from the other three Houses remain behind. McGonagall reminds Harry that he is supposed to be looking for something. Swept up the marble staircase with the defenders, Harry breaks away, heading down an empty corridor. He is beginning to panic&amp;mdash;he has no idea where to search for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. 

Harry races through the hallways. Glancing at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], he is unable to locate Ron and Hermione on it. Harry remembers that Voldemort warned the Carrows that Harry would attempt to enter Ravenclaw Tower. Harry is convinced the Horcrux must be linked to that House and it must be the Diadem; he wonders how Voldemort found an object lost centuries ago, then has a sudden brainwave. The Diadem has not been seen in living memory, but that does not include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]]. Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], the Gryffindor Ghost, who sends him to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|Grey Lady]]. She admits she was Rowena Ravenclaw’s daughter, Helena. Jealous of her mother's fame, she stole the Diadem and ran away to Albania, hiding the crown in a forest. A Baron who was in love with Helena found her, but she spurned him. Becoming violent, he fatally stabbed her, then killed himself in remorse. Harry realizes it was the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|Bloody Baron]]. Harry asks if she shared her story with anyone else, and she sadly admits she once told a charming Hogwarts student. Harry surmises Tom Riddle found the Diadem and created a Horcrux from it. He hid it at Hogwarts in a place he believed no one else knew existed.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] has returned from his cave with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]] after hearing Voldemort's voice. As Harry and Hagrid run through the halls, the first casualties are already appearing. A shattered stone gargoyle reminds Harry of the Ravenclaw statue at the Lovegood house. Another image appears to him: an old wizard's bust on which Harry once placed a tatty wig and a battered tiara inside a secret room that few ever knew existed. Harry suddenly realizes where the Diadem is&amp;mdash;it is the same &quot;battered tiara&quot; that he used to mark where his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] book in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] was hidden. As Harry races to it, he passes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], who has decided to join the battle, though Harry chastises him for suggesting that Slytherin students should have been kept as hostages. Harry finally finds Ron and Hermione, who, to his amazement, are carrying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] fangs that they retrieved from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] and a mangled cup. Ron remembered the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]] words Harry spoke when he unlatched the Locket Horcrux. Ron insisted that Hermione be the one to destroy the Cup Horcrux. Harry tells them about the Diadem.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione race to the Room of Requirement. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] is inside, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|Mrs. Longbottom]], Neville's grandmother, who has sealed off the tunnel to the inn. Tonks and Mrs. Longbottom leave to join the battle. Harry asks Ginny to step outside, but to come back inside later. When Ron says he wants to warn the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]], an overjoyed Hermione flings herself into Ron's arms, kissing him. He kisses her back, their unspoken feelings finally shared. Harry has everyone step into the corridor, then thinks hard to himself: ''I need the place where everything is hidden.'' An entrance appears. Inside the large labyrinthine room, they search for the Diadem. Harry spots it but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] suddenly arrive, and a fierce duel erupts. In the confusion, Malfoy drops his borrowed wand, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Goyle, and Crabbe unleashes an uncontrollable fire, setting the room ablaze. Crabbe is lost amongst the flames, but the Trio escapes unscathed on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomsticks]] that Harry finds. They save Malfoy and Goyle as they fly from the room. Harry, seeing the Diadem being tossed about by the fire, grabs it, then makes for the door.

Outside, they collapse on the hallway floor. The Diadem emits a thin shriek and falls apart in Harry's hand. Hermione says Crabbe must have conjured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]], one of the few things that can destroy a Horcrux.

Shouts and noises fill the hall; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] have penetrated the castle. Suddenly, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] appear, dueling two Death Eaters in the hallway; one is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]]. The wall is blasted open from the outside, and Fred is killed in the explosion.

== Analysis ==

If readers were holding out hope that some Slytherins, other than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]], would join forces against Voldemort, they are now disappointed. Although it would seem likely that at least a few Slytherins, particularly the half-bloods, must oppose Voldemort and his Death Eaters, they are denied that opportunity; when Slytherin House, led by Pansy Parkinson, aims their wands at Harry, McGonagall elects to send the entire House away, probably to avert a violent, and possibly lethal, confrontation with the other Houses who will defend Harry. Any Slytherins that have doubts about the wisdom of siding with Voldemort against Harry are submerged in the crowd. If they choose to fight Voldemort, they will do so from outside the school.

On the brink of battle, several characters undergo some significant realizations about themselves. For most of his life, Harry has felt isolated and suffered from a need to &quot;go it alone&quot;, often refusing others' assistance or accepting it only when pressured or as a last resort. Not only is Harry bolstered by his old friends and allies returning to Hogwarts, ready to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters, but as he races through the hallways, he yearns for Ron and Hermione's help and companionship. Harry has made great strides in learning to trust and rely on others.

Hermione is overjoyed when Ron wants to warn House-elves of the imminent danger. His growing maturity has led to his concern for others' well being, not just his own or his immediate family's. He now recognizes that Hermione's efforts on the Elves behalf has been valid and that these creatures deserve the same respect and consideration as other magical folk. Ron also shows his natural intelligence when, during the intense battle, he realizes that Basilisk fangs can destroy Horcruxes, something Harry must have forgotten about despite having destroyed Riddle's Diary with one. Recalling the Parseltongue words Harry spoke, Ron opens the Chamber of Secrets and retrieves the fangs. Hermione's genuine admiration for his cleverness, quick thinking, and leadership further enhances her feelings for him. And though Ron was responsible for retrieving the Basilisk fangs, he feels it is only right that Hermione should destroy the Cup Horcrux, she being an equal member of the Trio and responsible for much of their mission's success. These acts open the door to Ron and Hermione's submerged feelings for one another, though their happiness is quickly marred by tragedy.

That tragedy is Fred's untimely death, and not only does it cause intense pain and sorrow to those who loved him, it also tests their strength and courage. Racked with grief, Harry and the Weasley family must suppress their anguish and focus solely on the ensuing battle if they are to defeat Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Percy is particularly distraught, having just reunited with his estranged family. Hopefully he can find solace in having reconciled with Fred before he died, but for now, he diverts his grief into rage at the enemy to avenge his lost brother. Readers will recall that earlier in the book, George's ear was severed during the flight from the Dursleys' house. This may have foreshadowed him losing a larger part of himself, that part being Fred.

The rather morose Draco seen at Malfoy Manor has reverted to his familiar arrogant and bullying persona now that he is back at Hogwarts, lording over his faithful minions, Crabbe and Goyle. Away from his family's influence, Draco adopts a very different façade from the one he displays while in his parents' presence. However, that mask usually crumbles whenever Draco is faced with adversity, as it did when confronting Dumbledore on the Astronomy Tower in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince'']], and being forced to torture a fellow Death Eater [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|earlier in this book]]. Why he chose to remain in the castle when the other Slytherins departed to join Voldemort is unclear, and his true intentions will remain unknown. It is hinted that Draco may have been planning to capture Harry and present him to Voldemort, though he previously passed on that opportunity back at Malfoy Manor. Draco himself may be unaware just what his real motives are, vacillating between fearful indifference and seizing an opportunity to win back the Dark Lord's favor for his family. Draco is a vessel lacking a compass, and, as he may have learned from observing his mentor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], maintaining a neutral position makes it easier to align one's self with either winning side. However, when Draco realized Harry was after the Diadem, he may have wanted to capture him with the hope that he could reprieve the Malfoys from Voldemort's retaliation, and so redeem himself to his family, particularly his father, for his earlier failure in identifying Harry. 

Interestingly, when Draco and Harry confront one another in the Room of Requirement, Draco demands his wand back. However, even if Harry was inclined to return it, which he was not, it probably would be practically useless for Draco. When Harry captured the wand at Malfoy Manor, it likely transferred its allegiance from Draco to Harry, its new master. Indeed, Harry found that Draco's wand worked exceptionally well for him.

Ron having Hermione destroy the Cup Horcrux shows how deep the bond is between Harry, Ron, and Hermione: since Harry had already destroyed a Horcrux - the Diary - and Ron eliminated another - the Locket - then why should Hermione not destroy the third Horcrux? Harry will also place his complete trust in Neville to eliminate a final Horcrux in the event that he, Hermione, or Ron are unable. This all shows how Harry, who initially believed he should undertake the quest alone, depends on his friends far more than he ever realized. We will be reminded again when, though it was Harry who was tasked by Dumbledore to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, in the end, each Horcrux is eventually destroyed by a different person. And though Harry had wanted to search for the Horcruxes alone, Dumbledore always knew, and intended, that Ron and Hermione would accompany him, and other allies would aid him as well.

Ron wanting to warn the House-elves about the attack is what causes Hermione to throw herself into his arms and kiss him, overjoyed that he finally considers them as worthy beings; as it turns out, however, the usually overlooked creatures are not warned, but they play an important role in the final battle against Voldemort.

Also, Draco Malfoy choosing to stay at Hogwarts rather than leave with the other Slytherins will prove an important factor in the story. First, it is his friend, Crabbe, who - accidentally - destroys the Diadem Horcrux in the Room of Requirement. Then, when Harry revives after being struck by Voldemort's ineffective [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]], it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], Draco's mother, who is called upon to verify that Harry is dead. Because Draco is still inside the castle, Narcissa knows that the only way she can enter it, without risking Draco's life in further fighting, is if the Death Eaters enter unopposed, which would be unlikely if Harry was still alive. So, on finding Harry alive and able to confirm that Draco is also alive, she lies to Voldemort, thus sparing Harry's life. By now, she may also realize that only Harry can kill Voldemort, thus eliminating any future threat to herself and her family.

Relinquishing Draco's wand to him would not only render Harry powerless, Harry's ultimately defeating Voldemort hinges on his retaining it, that being the same wand that disarmed Dumbledore, and thus the wand that identifies the wizard the Elder Wand now owes its allegiance&amp;mdash;or so Harry hopes. At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] revealed that he was working in areas of magic that even those skilled in wand lore were unable to fully understand. Harry is still uncertain who the Elder Wand has determined is its master; it should, properly, be Draco, but as Harry has captured Draco's wand, the Elder Wand may now be Harry's. Harry, though, can only be certain that the Elder Wand is not fully Voldemort's, for all that he wields it. It is not until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|Harry's encounter with Voldemort]] that he becomes convinced that the Elder Wand has given its allegiance to Harry.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}
The castle is under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|serious attack]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] cannot allow himself to grieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]]'s death. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] dive to the floor to dodge curses as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] covers Fred’s body with his own to protect it. He refuses to budge when Ron tries to pull him away. Hermione screams&amp;mdash;one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]]'s descendants is crawling through a hole in the castle's outer wall. Harry and Ron simultaneously blast the giant [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|spider]], but more spiders are climbing up the wall, and Harry fires stunning spells at them. As curses soar overhead, Ron and Hermione rush down the corridor as Harry helps Percy hide Fred's body in a wall niche. Harry then takes off after Ron and Hermione while Percy chases [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augustus Rookwood|Rookwood]]. Hidden behind a tapestry, Ron, hysterical, wants to follow Percy and kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Hermione is pleading with Ron, saying only they can end it; they must find and kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|the snake]].

Hermione asks Harry where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and Nagini are. Harry slips inside Voldemort’s mind and sees a shabby, but familiar room. Voldemort is thinking about the Diadem and the place only he knows exists. Nagini floats above Voldemort in a protective sphere. A battered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] is asking about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. Voldemort tells him Draco is dead because he failed to join him with the other Slytherins. Malfoy urges him to halt the battle so the Dark Lord can be certain to kill Potter himself, but Voldemort knows Malfoy is only attempting to protect Draco. Malfoy is ordered to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]. Harry tells the others that Voldemort is in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]]. He knows his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] are being sought, and he is waiting for Harry to come to him. 

The Trio throw on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and head for the Shrieking Shack. Weaving through the fighting, they pass Draco Malfoy, who is pleading with a Death Eater that he is on their side; Harry stuns the Death Eater as Ron punches Draco in the face. Below, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], appearing to Harry as a blurry, four-legged gray animal as he rushes past, is about to bite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]. Hermione's curse hurls him against the staircase as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], leaning over the railing, drops a crystal ball onto his head. The spiders have forced their way into the entryway. As the fighters shoot curses at them, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] charges down the stairs yelling, &quot;Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!&quot; As Hagrid disappears into the spider throng, Harry dashes out from under the Cloak chasing after him. His path is blocked by a massive, hairy leg belonging to a twenty-foot [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]] appears calling for Hagrid, the bigger Giant launches itself at him, and the two furiously wrestle. Fighting is everywhere now and flashing curses streak through the air. 

The Trio rush to the forest, but near its edge, a hundred [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] glide towards them. Harry is too overcome by hopelessness to cast a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], while Ron and Hermione's Patronuses quickly flicker out. Suddenly, three other Patronuses soar past as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]] come running from the darkness. Luna encourages Harry to think of something happy, and after enormous effort, the silver stag bursts from his wand, scattering the Dementors. As another Giant lurches towards them, Harry shouts to Ron and Hermione to head for the Shrieking Shack.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]], the Trio crawls through the tunnel leading to the Shack. Inside, Snape is talking with Voldemort, nervously offering to find the boy so Voldemort can kill him himself. Voldemort declines, saying his Death Eaters have been ordered to capture Harry alive, and he believes the boy will come to him. He complains that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] fails to perform the extraordinary magic he expected. Voldemort tells Snape he has been a valuable servant and regrets what he must do, believing that when Snape killed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], Snape won the wand's allegiance. Unfortunately, Snape must die so Voldemort can become the Elder Wand's true master. With no remorse, Voldemort orders Nagini to kill Snape. When Voldemort leaves with Nagini, Harry and the others rush to Snape. Silvery-blue wisps are streaming from his mouth, ears, and eyes. Snape, barely alive, tells Harry, &quot;Take . . . it . . . Take . . . it.&quot; A crystal flask appears in mid air, and Harry gathers the strands into the container. Snape asks to look into Harry's green eyes before his life ebbs away.

== Analysis ==

Two significant deaths have occurred: Fred Weasley and Severus Snape. While Fred's death is a tragic loss, Snape's demise is a crucial element leading to the book's climax. Snape, and also readers, may have expected that Voldemort would eventually kill him, possibly no longer considering him an asset or perceiving him as a potential threat. It is still unknown, however, whether Snape was serving Voldemort or Dumbledore, or even neither. Just as Dumbledore had, Voldemort appears to believe that Snape was always loyal to him, and even still useful, but Voldemort's quest to become the Elder Wand's master takes precedence over everything else, and he willingly sacrifices Snape to obtain that mastery. Whether hero or villain, Snape's final act is to hand over to Harry what appears to be his memories. These could be the key to understanding Dumbledore's cryptic plan. Snape's final request to look into Harry's eyes may also be significant: others have commented, throughout the series, that Harry has his mother's eyes.

Lucius Malfoy, having been severely punished for failing Voldemort, shows deathly fear for his son Draco's life. This is probably among the few times Lucius has ever demonstrated any real emotion for another person, and it shows that, unlike Voldemort, Lucius is capable of love and desperately wants to save his only child. Voldemort, however, shows no concern for Draco, and previously endangered his life only as a means to penalize Lucius for failing to capture Harry at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Ministry of Magic]]. Though Lucius probably remains with the Dark Lord mostly out of fear for his own and his family's safety, he may also be scheming to recapture his mater's favor and reward. He will likely retain his evil ways should Voldemort win, and he is well aware that having entered the Dark Lord's service, there is no leaving it alive; it is only now, having been relegated to the organization's lower order, that he begins to understand why one might actually want to exit that service.

It is also interesting to note Hermione's changing views regarding the connection between Harry's mind and Voldemort's. At this book's beginning, Hermione was deeply dismayed by Harry occasionally viewing Voldemort's thoughts and actions, as it was via that channel that Harry had been deluded into delivering himself and five students into a trap at the Department of Mysteries earlier. Harry continually resisted attempts to close this channel, feeling that any information about Voldemort is valuable. Over the course of this book, Hermione has gradually adopted the same point-of-view, but this is the first time she has actively asked Harry to visit Voldemort's thoughts. This would seem to indicate she now somewhat trusts Harry's ability to control and filter what he sees inside Voldemort's mind.

There is an interesting side note here. The book describes Fenrir Greyback as a gray blur on four legs that Harry took to be an animal. This could possibly suggest that he was transformed into his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] form as he attempts to bite Lavender Brown. In that event, there would be a full moon, but there is no mention as to whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], also a Werewolf, has been similarly transformed. Lupin is seen as a human when he arrives at Hogwarts, but it is possible it is still too early for the moon to rise. It may be that Greyback is simply acting wolf-like; as we have heard and seen, he does attack like a wolf even when in human form, as when he savaged Bill Weasley. However, being able to survive such a severe blow to the head from Trelawney's heavy crystal ball with almost no injuries could indicate that he was transformed. While it is never made absolutely clear what form he is in, it is true that Harry, who has never seen Fenrir transformed, recognizes him. As the author is careful about having every character properly named before Harry recognizes him or her, this does lend some weight that Fenrir is in human form, though it is curious as to why she would describe him in a manner suggesting his gray Werewolf form or that Harry would perceive him as a gray animal. Being as Fenrir is the Werewolf leader, and Remus Lupin had infiltrated Fenrir's pack, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] members should know his transformed description, but there is no indication one way or the other as to whether Harry has been so briefed.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Voldemort here has fallen into the same misunderstanding about the Elder Wand's allegiance that so many have before him. It is not just by murder of its current holder that frees the wand to accept a new master, but the wand's forcible removal from its owner that also wins its allegiance. One might wonder why Voldemort failed to recognize this, despite knowing about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]]'s continuing survival while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] commanded the wand, and Grindelwald's remaining alive during the sixty years that Dumbledore mastered it. However, we have seen that Voldemort tends to solve problems by killing people. It is unlikely that Voldemort enjoys killing; if he did, he likely would have stayed to watch Snape die. His walking out before Snape expired indicates that he sees killing Snape as simply the solution to the Elder Wand problem, and once the solution has been applied, it no longer concerns him.

In the next chapter, we discover why Snape, who knows he is dying, asked Harry to look into his eyes. He has already handed over to Harry the memories that Dumbledore charged Snape with providing Harry. They explain everything to Harry as well as provide Snape's own justification for his actions. These memories will show that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] was the only woman Snape ever loved, and it was for her that Snape allowed himself to promise to do all that he did for Harry, little as it may have seemed at the time. We have been told repeatedly that Harry has Lily's eyes, and, as he dies, Snape desires to gaze into those eyes one final time.</text>

fmap has type:

  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b

Substituting &lt;code&gt;((-&gt;) t)&lt;/code&gt; where we have f:
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (t -&gt; a) -&gt; (t -&gt; b)

which is the type of composition:

  instance Applicative Maybe where
    pure = Just
    (Just f) &lt;*&gt; (Just x) = Just (f x)
    _        &lt;*&gt; _        = Nothing

  pure id &lt;*&gt; v = v                            -- Identity
  pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w) -- Composition
  pure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = pure (f x)               -- Homomorphism
  u &lt;*&gt; pure y = pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u              -- Interchange
  fmap f x = pure f &lt;*&gt; x                      -- Fmap

* Identity:

  pure id &lt;*&gt; v = Just id &lt;*&gt; v

The match depends only on &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;:

  = case v of
      Nothing -&gt; Nothing
      Just v' -&gt; Just (id v') = Just v'

So the Identity law holds.

* Composition:
  pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = ((Just (.) &lt;*&gt; u) &lt;*&gt; v) &lt;*&gt; w

In case &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, the first part (&lt;code&gt;Just (.) &lt;*&gt; u&lt;/code&gt;) will also be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, and thus the whole expression will be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;. So assume that &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Just u'&lt;/code&gt;. Then we have:

  ((Just (.) &lt;*&gt; Just u') &lt;*&gt; v) &lt;*&gt; w = (Just (u' .) &lt;*&gt; v) &lt;*&gt; w

Again, if v is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, the whole expression will be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;. Assume that &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Just v'&lt;/code&gt;. The result:

  (Just (u' .) &lt;*&gt; v) &lt;*&gt; w = (Just (u' . v')) &lt;*&gt; w

Same here, but now assume that &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Just w'&lt;/code&gt;:

  (Just (u' . v')) &lt;*&gt; w = Just ((u' . v') w') = Just (u' (v' w'))
  = Just u' &lt;*&gt; Just (v' w')

This can be changed back to &lt;code&gt;u &lt;*&gt; Just (v' w')&lt;/code&gt;, because if we add back the probability that &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;u &lt;*&gt; Just (v' w')&lt;/code&gt; is Nothing, which is what we want. We also have:

  Just (v' w') = Just v' &lt;*&gt; Just w'

And if we add back the probability that &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, we will see that that subexpression will be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; if any of the two is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;. Also, this will make the whole expression equal to &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;. Now we have:

  u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w)

So the Composition law holds

* Homomorphism

  pure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = Just f &lt;*&gt; Just x = Just (f x) = pure (f x)

By definition of &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt;.

* Interchange

  u &lt;*&gt; pure y = u &lt;*&gt; Just y

This depends only on the value of u:

  = case u of
      Nothing -&gt; Nothing
      Just u' -&gt; Just (u' y)

On the other hand, we have:

  pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u = Just ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u

This also depends only on the value of u:

  = case u of
      Nothing -&gt; Nothing
      Just u' -&gt; Just (($ y) u') = Just (u' y)

So the Interchange law holds.

* Fmap

  fmap f x = case x of
               Nothing -&gt; Nothing
               Just x' -&gt; Just (f x')

On the other hand, we have:

  pure f &lt;*&gt; x = Just f &lt;*&gt; x

This depends only on the value of x:

  = case x of
      Nothing -&gt; Nothing
      Just x' -&gt; Just (f x')

So the Fmap law holds.

2)

  instance Applicative (Either e) where
    pure = Right
    (Right f) &lt;*&gt; (Right x) = Right (f x)
    (Left e)  &lt;*&gt; _         = Left e
    _         &lt;*&gt; (Left e)  = Left e
  
  instance Applicative ((-&gt;) t) where
    pure = const
    f1 &lt;*&gt; f2 = \t -&gt; f1 t (f2 t)

== Monads and Applicative Functors ==

{{Exercises|1=
Check that the &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; instance of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; can be obtained by the above transformation.
}}

For reference, here is the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;:

  instance Monad Maybe where
    return = Just
    Nothing &gt;&gt;= _ = Nothing
    Just x  &gt;&gt;= f = f x

Obviously: &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt;.

De-sugaring &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; gives:

  ap f x = f &gt;&gt;= \f' -&gt; x &gt;&gt;= \x' -&gt; return (f' x')

Substituting the first &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; by its definition gives:

  ap f x = case f of
    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
    Just f' -&gt; x &gt;&gt;= \x' -&gt; return (f' x')

Substituting the second &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; by its definition gives:

  ap f x = case f of
    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
    Just f' -&gt; case x of
      Nothing -&gt; Nothing
      Just x' -&gt; Just (f' x')

If we change the &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; branches by pattern matches, we get:

  ap Nothing _ = Nothing
  ap (Just f') Nothing = Nothing
  ap (Just f') (Just x') = Just (f' x')

which can be written as:

  ap (Just f') (Just x') = Just (f' x')
  ap _         _         = Nothing

Which is the definition of &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;</text>

Bodged? I've never heard this word before in my life. I love it! A great word. Keep 'em coming. Thanks for expanding my vocabulary.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 23:51, 12 August 2007 (UTC)
:It's a very English word, which I dredged up as being only appropriate for this very English story. A bodge, or something that is bodged together, is something that is just sort of thrown together, and works so long as no real demands are made on it. As we see here, once it is used, it generally fails... An English friend of mine dreamed up a contracting firm, Bodgit and Scarper, whose name indicates that they would sort of ham-fistedly hang something together and then run out. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:40, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

This brings up an issue I've been wondering about. So far the book synopsis have been done in a more general American style. The general Wikipedia pages for Harry Potter are being written in the British style (a real head trip for me). Do we want to do the same for the books? It's certainly OK with me, and it seem appropriate, although I'm still learning to write/speak British.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 18:13, 15 August 2007 (UTC)
:I would say no. What we're doing is a bit of a hybrid, mixed American and British, American with British spellings and the odd British word, which may be awkward, but is what the bulk of our audience, who are American, will be most comfortable with. And frankly, I don't think any of us here would be able to do much with the British style, not well enough to make it feel like British anyway. My feeling is that the best way for us is to continue what we're doing, and if a true Brit wants to come along later and anglicize us, fine. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:32, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

== Polyjuice and gender ==

It's not true that we've seen transformations only within gender; Crabbe and Goyle were transformed into little girls in the preceding book to stand guard outside the Room of Requirement. [[User:Bpmullins|Bpmullins]] ([[User talk:Bpmullins|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bpmullins|contribs]]) 17:12, 27 April 2011 (UTC)
:True. Thank you for mentioning that; I've modified the analysis accordingly. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:30, 13 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Braille ==

BRAILLE IS NOT A LANGUAGE!!!!1!!1111!!!
It's a writing system, or more accurately, a code for representing letters of a writing system. Don't get me wrong, I think braille is cool and all. I learned it as a kid before they figured out I could read print better, but the point is, braille a writing system, not a language &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash; Preceding unsigned comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.139.115.211|70.139.115.211]] ([[User talk:70.139.115.211|talk]]) 00:09, 13 August 2007&lt;/small&gt;

: This was addressed.  Braille was removed, and a discussion of the status of written language was added.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:26, 13 January 2014 (UTC)

== Conlang questions? ==

So far, all the questions seem to be pretty much about linguistics, rather than about conlanging as such.  For example, there ought to be some sort of basic questions about books, on-line resources, organizations &amp;mdash; not sure if that's three questions, two questions, or one question.  Somewhere in the answers would be, no doubt, some elaborated forms of &quot;LCC&quot; and &quot;Zompist and CONLANG&quot;.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:19, 14 January 2010 (UTC)
: Okay, here are two questions that might be elaborated:
:* Q: Where can I find conlang resources?  A: LCS.  This is a variant on the &quot;Where do I start?&quot; question, a couple of sections back.
::: {{done}} as &quot;Is there a conlanging community?&quot; --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:43, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
:* Q: Is there a natlang with X?  A: ANADEW.
::: {{done}} --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:06, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
: --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:44, 11 January 2014 (UTC)

* Q: What's the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis?
:: We want a really good conlanging-oriented answer to this question.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Toaster.jpg|thumb|A Toaster]]

A toaster is designed to heat the sides of a slice of bread for the right amount of time, turning the slice of bread into toast.   

== Who invented it? ==
The first electric toaster was made in 1893 in Great Britain by Crompton and Co. A person had to turn the bread over to toast both sides and turn the machine off by hand. An American, Charles Strite, invented the pop-up toaster in 1919.

== How does it get power? ==
Electricity provides the energy that the toaster needs.  When electric current flows through the coils of wire inside the toaster, they become so hot that they glow red.  These glowing red wires are called '''heating elements'''.

== How does it work? ==
A heating element in a toaster is most often a thick nichrome wire. Like most wires in any house, nichrome wire conducts electricity. But other wires are made of metals that are better conductors of electricity. That means that electricity is easily passed through the wire, which can help all sorts of things work. But nichrome wire can't deliver electricity as well as copper can. All the energy can't transfer down the nichrome wire, so instead its energy becomes heat. This means the wire gets very, very hot! The same kinds of heating elements are used in combination with a fan in household hair dryers.
The heating elements heat up everything around them, including the bread. If the bread is close to the heating element for the right amount of time, it turns a light brown color and turns into toast. If it is heated too long, the toast will turn black and begin to smoke. Toasters are generally built so that they stop on their own, to prevent this from happening.

A pop up toaster causes the toast to &quot;pop&quot; up when it stops.  The '''slots''' in the top of it hold the bread.  When the bread is first added, a cage at the bottom of the slot holds it up, partway out of its slot.  At first, the heating elements are not hot, because no electrical current is flowing through them.  The black lever on the right can be pushed down, which lowers the bread all the way in, so that it is very near the heating elements.  Two other important things happen as the lever is pushed down.  First, with the lever pushed down, the toaster allows electricity to flow through the heating elements, which causes the bread to start toasting.  Second, a spring is compressed, and a '''latch''' holds the lever in place at the bottom position.  Even if a person lets go of the lever at this point, the latch will keep it in place, and the toast will continue toasting.

But it won't continue forever.  The bread isn't the only thing being heated by the heating element: many parts of the toaster itself are also being heated up.  One of these parts is the '''release mechanism'''.  This part is designed to change its shape as its temperature increases.  Eventually, the release mechanism heats up enough that the latch is released: this is what makes the popping sound.  Once the latch is released, the spring quickly pulls up on the lever, which stops the flow of electric current and allows the heating element to begin cooling down.  At the same time, the spring pulls up the cage at the bottom of the slots, pushing the toast up out of the slots, so that it is easy to remove from the toaster.  The release mechanism can be set to release the latch at a higher or lower temperature, which will cause the toast to be darker or lighter.

== How dangerous is it? ==
CAUTION: YOU CAN GET A SHOCK!
Because it uses electricity a toaster can be dangerous around water.  Although it can be tempting to remove a stuck piece of toast with a knife, it is extremely dangerous to put anything metal into a toaster because the element can conduct electricity to the metal and to the person holding it.  Because it gets very hot, you can burn yourself if you get too close to the elements.
With some toasters that do not automatically turn off, toast can catch on fire. Fire is very dangerous.  It can burn you very badly and painfully!

== What does it do? ==
It heats bread until the bread caramelizes and turns brown. The inside of the bread remains soft whilst the outside is charred, creating a crispy texture. It can also be used to heat other similarly sized bread- or cake-like foods.

== How does it vary? ==
Many types of toasters have been made.  Some, like the kind used in most restaurants, have a slot running all the way through it, and moves the toast slowly in one end and out the other.  In this case, the toast is made darker or lighter by controlling how fast the toast moves through the toaster.  Others, including toaster ovens, have a mechanical timer that allows electric current to flow only until a set amount of time has passed.

== How has it changed the world? ==
The toaster hasn't changed the world much, but it does sometimes make breakfast a little warmer and tastier.  The texture of bread is improved by toasting it, as is the taste.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
It was necessary to develop the following:
* Production of electricity.
* A distribution system to make electricity available to the public.
* An understanding of how electrical conduction through a resistance causes heat.

      <comment>/* XForms Application */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to have a control that suggests a set of values in a drop-down list but also allows a user to type in their own value.

== Method ==

Just add the attribute selection=&quot;open&quot; to your select1 control:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;my-data&quot; selection=&quot;open&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image ==
[[Image:XForms-open-selection-screen-images.jpg|center|frame|Select1 Control with selection attribute set to be open]]

Note that although a list of possible countries is listed, the user can type in any country that is not on this list.

== XForms Application ==
[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/02-controls/02-select1/select1-open.xhtml Load XForms Application]

The following example allows you to select a country code or enter your own country code:


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms Select1 Control Using Open Selection&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;![CDATA[body {font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;}]]&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
                &lt;data&gt;
                    &lt;CountryCode/&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;XForms Select1 control using selection=&quot;open&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;CountryCode&quot; selection=&quot;open&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Country:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
            &lt;xf:item&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;USA&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:value&gt;usa&lt;/xf:value&gt;
            &lt;/xf:item&gt;
            &lt;xf:item&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Canada&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:value&gt;can&lt;/xf:value&gt;
            &lt;/xf:item&gt;
            &lt;xf:item&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Japan&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:value&gt;jpn&lt;/xf:value&gt;
            &lt;/xf:item&gt;
            &lt;xf:item&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Mexico&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:value&gt;mex&lt;/xf:value&gt;
            &lt;/xf:item&gt;
            &lt;xf:item&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Other&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:value&gt;other&lt;/xf:value&gt;
            &lt;/xf:item&gt;
       &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
       &lt;br/&gt;
       Output: &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;CountryCode&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Very often you want to suggest values to the user to ensure consistency of data entry.  The problem is that there are sometimes exceptions to a small list of items and the open selection control allows these exceptions to be entered.

One challenge of using this control is to let the user know they can enter an exception.  You may have to add instructional text on the form such as &quot;type value in this field if it does not appear on this list&quot;.

== Overview ==

'''''Gellert Grindelwald''''' was the most terrible Dark Wizard to exist before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] came to prominence. &lt;!-- Note to editors re: &quot;Albus Dumbledore was in love with Gellert Grindelwald.&quot; Whether or not he was, this does not belong in the overview. It is in the Greater Picture, below. --&gt;

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Grindelwald is mentioned briefly on the back of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s Chocolate Frog card as the Dark Wizard Dumbledore defeated in 1945.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] that the line within a circle within a triangle symbol that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] wore as a pendant at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding was the symbol of Gellert Grindelwald.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s tell-all book about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] reveals that when young Albus was about 17 years of age, Gellert Grindelwald, also about 17, came to Godric's Hollow to live with his great-aunt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]. He had been expelled from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] for near-fatal attacks on other students. Dumbledore and Grindelwald become close friends, and were apparently plotting to enforce wizard rule over Muggles, always for the Muggles' own good, of course. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], seeing Voldemort's memory of the wand maker [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] and finding Grindelwald's picture in Skeeter's book, realizes that he is the thief who stole [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|The Elder Wand]] from Gregorovitch. It is learned that Grindelwald was still alive, though imprisoned in the highest tower in Nurmengard, the prison Grindelwald himself built to hold those who opposed him. Voldemort successfully hunted him down there, although Grindelwald lied to Voldemort, claiming never to have had the Elder Wand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse in rage.

Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald were seeking the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], which would have made them masters of death. Grindelwald had actually adopted the Deathly Hallows symbol for his organization. When their plan was derailed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]], a fight broke out, resulting in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Aberforth and Albus' sister, Ariana]] being killed. Grindelwald immediately fled Godric's Hollow, possibly fearing that this tragedy would also be laid at his feet. After stealing the Elder Wand from Gregorovitch, he used its power to begin his conquest of Europe. He was defeated by Dumbledore, who stated it would have been &quot;too shameful&quot; for him to delay taking action any longer.&lt;!-- check quote (I modified this as it was not an actual quote by Dumbledore.)--&gt;

== Strengths ==

Grindelwald was described being an ambitious and brilliant student. He was intelligent and his magical skills were comparable to those of Albus Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort. He was considered to be the most powerful Dark wizard of all time until the rise of Voldemort a generation later.

== Weaknesses ==

Grindelwald was vain, arrogant, narcissistic, cruel and believed himself to be superior to all other wizards. He developed an insatiable lust for power and was easily drawn to Dark magic to obtain his perverted goals. After learning about the three Deathly Hallows, he developed an obsessive desire to possess them, especially the Elder Wand, believing they would help him conquer the Wizarding realm, as well as master death.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Grindelwald developed a close, intense, but short-lived, friendship with Albus Dumbledore when the two were teenagers. The relationship ended abruptly, leaving many unanswered questions as to why it suddenly collapsed. &lt;!-- Note to editors: re: &quot;Dumbledore loved him, unknown if the feelings were returned&quot;, or in fact about any relationship bigger than mere friendship, between Grindelwald and Dumbledore: This is a kids book, we have decided that issues of sexuality will go in the Greater Picture area only. --&gt;

Grindelwald had been expelled from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], apparently for practicing Dark magic. It is possible that he had followers at Durmstrang, much as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] had at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], but apart from his relationship with Dumbledore, it is uncertain if he had any real friends at all.

Though he stayed with his great-aunt, Bathilda Bagshot, after being expelled from Durmstrang, Bagshot's memories as published in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book lead us to believe that Bathilda was not in his confidence. She apparently had no idea what he was planning with Dumbledore.

== Analysis ==
&lt;!-- Note to editors: re: &quot;Gay lovers with Dumbledore according to Rowling on 20 October, 2007.&quot; This is a kids book, we have decided that issues of sexuality will go in the Greater Picture area only. --&gt;

In order to have achieved the fame that is accorded him, it is necessary for Dumbledore to have done something that had major repercussions in the Wizarding world. Otherwise, why would his being Hogwarts' headmaster have garnered that much acclaim? Even with Hogwarts being the only major school in England, and a leading school in Europe as a whole, it is unlikely that the headmaster would have a direct share in the school's glory. Headmasters, like teachers, generally have limited direct influence, no matter how much their students accomplish. Dumbledore, however, had apparently been offered the post of Minister for Magic, which he declined, and he has had many other honours bestowed upon him, not least of which (in his opinion) is his selection as one of the wizards appearing on Chocolate Frog cards. A headmaster is not typically singled out as &quot;possibly the best wizard in our lifetime.&quot; Granted, Dumbledore was academically brilliant, as revealed in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', but it seems that his defeating Grindelwald is what crystallized his ascendancy in the Wizarding public's collective minds. Thus Grindelwald provides a necessary foil to Dumbledore in his younger days. When their epic battle took place in 1945, Dumbledore would have been 64-years-old and in the prime of his powers. Grindelwald was, possibly, a little younger; he had been expelled from Durmstrang and took refuge at his aunt's home the summer after Dumbledore's graduation.

We should note that while the Elder Wand is by reputation undefeatable in a duel, it has apparently changed hands many times by force, including murder. In ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'', we see that the very first holder of the wand was murdered in his sleep. And there are many other circumstances where the wand could be defeated; we see one such for ourselves, where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament charm]], cast by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], prevents Dumbledore's use of the wand. We don't know the circumstances of the actual duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald; despite teasers that we hear in an interview with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], the chapter of her book dealing with that duel does not form a part of Harry's story. But we can guess that Grindelwald's earlier friendship with Dumbledore, though it would have been almost a half century before, could well have hindered his ability to duel.

On a side note, there is a resort town in Switzerland, just north of the Eiger, named Grindelwald, as well as a village with that name in Tasmania, Australia. It is unknown whether either town was the inspiration for this character's name.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The young Dumbledore was blinded to Grindelwald's insatiable power-hungry drive to become a dictator. Dumbledore believed that the ultimate goal was to make the world safe for people like his sister Ariana to exist; he believed that Muggles living under benevolent wizard rule would have made it possible for wizard offspring and Muggle children to co-exist. A simple test of one's personality is which specific Hallow they believe is the most valuable, and why. Grindelwald clearly believed the Elder Wand, unbeatable in a duel, was superior, with the Resurrection Stone running second. Albus felt the Resurrection Stone was more important. To Grindelwald, the Resurrection Stone was a means to raise an army of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]]; to Albus, it would have restored his lost family. Neither had much interest in the Invisibility Cloak, though Dumbledore considered it as a possible means to hide his sister's condition. Why did Dumbledore fail to see that Grindelwald was choosing the evil path to power? Dumbledore's deep attraction for Grindelwald may have caused him, initially, to overlook his friend's flaws. Also, his own pride in his superior intellect and extraordinary magical abilities may also have deluded him into believing that he and Grindelwald knew what was best for the Wizarding world. With the foolishness of youth, he perhaps thought he could turn Grindelwald to his own, somewhat more gentle ends.

It was this episode with Grindelwald, and his sister Ariana's resulting death, that led Dumbledore to believe that he could never trust himself with power, too tempted to misuse it if he were ever in a high-level position such as Minister for Magic. Surprisingly, this is a key plot point in the story. Would Dumbledore have had the nerve to oppose the Minister for Magic, as he did to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], had he not been a strong enough wizard to take that post himself? And if he was that strong, what conceivable reason would there be for his declining the Minister post? This is unanswered, though, years later, Harry needed someone this powerful to train him, and to defend him from the Ministry, and it would have been impossible for Harry to have been trained by a Minister for Magic.

==Objectives==
After completing this section, you should know the: 

* symbols used to represent atoms; 
* names of molecules commonly found in animal cells; 
* characteristics of ions and electrolytes; 
* basic structure of carbohydrates with examples; 
* carbohydrates can be divided into mono- di- and poly-saccharides; 
* basic structure of fats or lipids with examples; 
* basic structure of proteins with examples; 
* function of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins in the cell and animals' bodies; 
* foods which supply carbohydrates, lipids and proteins in animal diets. 

==Elements And Atoms==
The elements (simplest chemical substances) found in an animal’s body are all made of basic building blocks or atoms.  The most common elements found in cells are given in the table below with the symbol that is used to represent them.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; margin: 0px auto 0px auto; text-align: center;&quot;
! Atom || Symbol
|-
| Calcium || Ca
|-
| Carbon || C
|-
| Chlorine || Cl
|-
| Copper || Cu
|-
| Iodine || I
|-
| Hydrogen || H
|-
| Iron || Fe
|-
| Magnesium || Mg
|-
| Nitrogen || N
|-
| Oxygen || O
|-
| Phosphorous || P
|-
| Potassium || K
|-
| Sodium || Na
|-
| Sulfur || S
|-
| Zinc || Zn
|}

==Compounds And Molecules==
A  '''compound''' or '''molecule''' is formed when two or more '''atoms''' join together. 
Note that some atoms are never found alone. For example '''oxygen''' is always found as molecules of 2 oxygen atoms (represented as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). 

The table below gives some common compounds.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; margin: 0px auto 0px auto; text-align: center;&quot;
! Compound || Symbol
|-
| Calcium carbonate || CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Carbon dioxide || CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Copper sulfate || CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Glucose || C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
|- 
| Hydrochloric acid || HCl
|-
| Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) || NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Sodium chloride (table salt) || NaCl
|-
| Sodium hydroxide || NaOH
|-
| Water || H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
|}

==Chemical Reactions==
Reactions occur when atoms combine with or separate from other atoms.  In the process new products with different chemical properties are formed. 

Chemical reactions can be represented by '''chemical equations'''.  The starting atoms or compounds are usually put on the left-hand side of the equation and the products on the right-hand side.

For example         
* H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* Water + Carbon dioxide gives Carbonic acid

==Ionisation==
When some atoms dissolve in water they become charged particles called '''ions'''. Some become positively charged ions and others negatively charged. Ions may have one, two or sometimes three charges. 

The table below shows examples of positively and negatively charged ions with the number of their charges.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; margin: 0px auto 0px auto; text-align: center;&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Positive Ions
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Negative Ions
|-
| H+ || Hydrogen || Cl- ||Chloride
|-
| Ca&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ || Calcium || OH- || Hydroxyl
|-
| Na+ || Sodium || HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- || Bicarbonate
|-
| K+ || Potassium || CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- || Carbonate
|-
| Mg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ || Magnesium || SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- || Sulfate
|-
| Fe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ || Iron (ferrous) || PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;- || Phosphate
|-
| Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+ || Iron (ferric) || S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- || Sulfide
|}

Positive and negative ions attract one another to hold compounds together. 

Ions are important in cells because they conduct electricity when dissolved in water.  Substances that ionise in this way are known as '''electrolytes'''. 

The molecules in an animal’s body fall into two groups: '''inorganic compounds''' and '''organic compounds'''. The difference between these is that the first type does not contain '''carbon''' and the second type does.

==Organic And Inorganic Compounds== 
Inorganic compounds include water, sodium chloride, potassium hydroxide and calcium phosphate. 

'''Water''' is the most abundant inorganic compound, making up over 60% of the volume of cells and over 90% of body fluids like blood. Many substances dissolve in water and all the chemical reactions that take place in the body do so when dissolved in water. Other inorganic molecules help keep the '''acid/base balance ( pH''')  and concentration of the blood and other body fluids stable (see Chapter 8). 
 
Organic compounds include '''carbohydrates, proteins''' and '''fats'''.  All organic molecules contain carbon atoms and they tend to be larger and more complex molecules than inorganic ones. This is largely because each carbon atom can link with four other atoms. Organic compounds can therefore consist of from one to many thousands of carbon atoms joined to form chains, branched chains and rings (see diagram below). All organic compounds also contain hydrogen and they may also contain other elements.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals-organic compounds.jpg|center]]

==Carbohydrates==
The name “carbohydrate” tells you something about the composition of these “hydrated carbon” compounds. They contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and like water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), there are always twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms in each molecule. Carbohydrates are a large and diverse group that includes sugars, starches, glycogen and cellulose.  Carbohydrates in the diet supply an animal with much of its energy and in the animal’s body, they transport and store energy.  

Carbohydrates are divided into three major groups based on size: '''monosaccharides''' (single sugars), '''disaccharides''' (double sugars) and '''polysaccharides''' (multi sugars).

'''Monosaccharides''' are the smallest carbohydrate molecules. The most important monosaccharide is glucose which supplies much of the energy in the cell. It consists of a ring of 6 carbon atoms with oxygen and hydrogen atoms attached.
         
'''Disaccharides''' are formed when 2 monosaccharides join together. Sucrose (table sugar), maltose, and lactose (milk sugar), are three important disaccharides. They are broken down to monosaccharides by digestive enzymes in the gut. 

'''Polysaccharides''' like starch, glycogen and cellulose are formed by tens or hundreds of monosaccharides linking together. Unlike mono- and di-saccharides, polysaccharides are not sweet to taste and most do not dissolve in water.

:* '''Starch''' is the main molecule in which plants store the energy gained from the sun. It is found in grains like barley and roots like potatoes.  
:* '''Glycogen''', the polysaccharide used by animals to store energy, is found in the liver and the muscles that move the skeleton.  
:* '''Cellulose''' forms the rigid cell walls of plants. Its structure is similar to glycogen, but it can’t be digested by mammals. Cows and horses can eat cellulose with the help of bacteria which live in specialised parts of their gut.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals-Polysaccharides.jpg|center]]

==Fats== 
'''Fats''' or '''lipids''' are important in the plasma membrane around cells and form the insulating fat layer under the skin. They are also a highly concentrated source of energy, and when eaten in the diet provide twice as much energy per gram  as either carbohydrates or proteins.

Like carbohydrates fats contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but unlike them, there is no 
particular relationship between the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. 

The fats and oils animals eat in their diets are  called  '''triglycerides''' or''' neutral fats'''. The building blocks of triglycerides are 3 '''fatty acids''' attached to a backbone of '''glycerol''' ('''glycerine'''). When fats are eaten the digestive enzymes break down the molecules into separate fatty acids and glycerol again.

'''Fatty acids''' are divided into two kinds: '''saturated''' and '''unsaturated fatty acids''' depending on how 
much hydrogen they contain.  The fat found in animals bodies and in dairy products contains mainly saturated fatty acids and tends to be solid at room temperature. Fish and poultry fats and plant oils contain mostly unsaturated fatty acids and are more liquid at room temperature. 

'''Phospholipids''' are lipids that contain a phosphate group. They are important in the plasma membrane of the cell.

[[Image:Triglyceride.JPG|left]]
[[Image:Chain of amino acids.jpg|center]]

==Proteins==
'''Proteins''' are the third main group of organic compounds in the cell - in fact if you dried out a cell you would find that about 2/3 of the dry dust you were left with would consist of protein. Like carbohydrates and fats, proteins contain C, H and O but they all also contain '''nitrogen'''. Many also contain sulphur and phosphorus. 

In the cell, proteins are an important part of the plasma membrane of the cell, but their most essential role is as '''enzymes'''. These are molecules that act as biological catalysts and are necessary for biochemical reactions to proceed.  Protein is also found as '''keratin''' in the skin, feathers and hair, in muscles, as well as in antibodies and some hormones. 

Proteins are built up of long chains of smaller molecules called '''amino acids'''. There are 20 common types of amino acid and different numbers of these arranged in different orders create the multitude of individual proteins that exist in an animal’s body. 

Long chains of amino acids often link with other amino acid chains and the resulting protein molecule may twist, spiral and fold up to make a complex 3-dimensional shape. As an example, see the diagram of the protein lysozyme below. Believe it or not, this is a small and relatively simple protein. 

[[Image:Protein conformation.jpg|center]]

It is this shape that determines how proteins behave in cells, particularly when they are acting as enzymes. If for any reason this shape is altered, the protein stops working. This is what happens if proteins are heated or put in a solution that is too acidic or alkaline.  Think what happens to the “white’” of an egg when it is cooked. The “white” contains the protein albumin, which is changed or “'''denatured'''” permanently by cooking.  The catastrophic effect that heat has on enzymes is one of the reasons animals die if exposed to high temperatures. 

In the animal’s diet, proteins are found in meat (muscle), dairy products, seeds, nuts and legumes like soya.  When the enzymes in the gut digest proteins they break them down into the separate amino acids, which are small enough to be absorbed into the blood.

==Summary==
* '''Ions''' are charged particles, and '''electrolytes''' are solutions of ions in water.
* '''Carbohydrates''' are made of carbon with hydrogen and oxygen (in the same ratio as water) linked together. The cell mainly uses carbohydrates for energy.
*  '''Fats''' are also made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are a powerful energy source, and are also used for insulation.
* '''Proteins''' are the building materials of the body, and as '''enzymes''' make cell reactions happen. They contain nitrogen as well as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

== About This Gadget ==

This gadget allows you the editor, in some situations, to create special &quot;insert&quot; links using regular wikitext. Insert links are only used on edit pages. Clicking an insert link will cause text to automatically be inserted into the edit window. This helps for situations where many pages need to be created for a single book/project, and standard sets of boilder-plate code need to be inserted. 

To use this gadget, you must have a way to be able to load wikitext to an edit screen. There are a few ways to do this:
#Use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;editintro=&lt;/code&gt; URL argument, to specify a page to be loaded above an edit window.
#Use the &lt;code&gt;editintro=&lt;/code&gt; argument to an &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;inputbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
#Use javascript to load these links on an edit page

None of these tasks are particularly easy. If you have a project and would like to use '''Edit Insert''' links to help make common tasks easier, ask [[User talk:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] for help.

==Objectives==

After completing this section, you should know:
* how to write the scientific name of animals correctly
* know that animals belong to the Animal kingdom and that this is divided into phyla, classes, orders, families 
* know the definition of a species
* know the phylum and class of the more common animals dealt with in this course

'''Classification''' is the process used by scientists to make sense of the 1.5 million or so different kinds of living organisms on the planet. It does this by describing, naming and placing them in different groups. As veterinary nurses you are mainly concerned with the Animal Kingdom but don’t forget that animals rely on the Plant Kingdom for food to survive. Also many diseases that animals are affected by are members of the other Kingdoms -- fungi, bacteria and single celled animals.

==Naming And Classifying Animals==

There are more than 1.5 million different kinds of living organism on Earth ranging from small and simple bacteria to large, complex mammals. From the earliest time that humans have studied the natural world they have named these living organisms and placed them in different groups on the basis of their similarities and differences.

==Naming Animals== 

Of course we know what a cat, a dog and a whale are but, in some situations using the common names for animals can be confusing. Problems arise because people in different countries, and even sometimes in the same country, have different common names for the same animals. For example a cat can be a chat, a Katze, gato, katt, or a moggie, depending on which language you use. To add to the confusion sometimes the same name is used for different animals. For example, the name ‘gopher’ is used for ground squirrels, rodents (pocket gophers), for moles and in the south-eastern United States for a turtle. This is the reason why all animals have been given an 
official '''scientific''' or '''binomial name'''. Unfortunately these names are always in Latin. For example: 

* Common rat: ''Rattus rattus''
* Human: ''Homo sapiens''
* Domestic cat: ''Felis domesticus''
* Domestic dog: ''Canis familiaris''

As you can see from the above there are certain rules about writing scientific names:

* They always have '''2 parts''' to them. 
* The first part is the '''genus''' name and is always written with a '''capital''' first letter. 
* The second name is the '''species''' name and is always written in '''lower case'''. 
* The name is always '''underlined''' or printed in '''italics'''.


The first time you refer to an organism you should write the whole name in full. If you need to keep referring to the same organism you can then abbreviate the genus name to just the initial. Thus “''Canis familiaris''” becomes “''C. familiaris''” the second and subsequent times you refer to it.

==Classification Of Living Organisms==

To make some sense of the multitude of living organisms they have been placed in different groups. The method that has been agreed by biologists for doing this is called the '''classification system'''. The system is based on the assumption that the process of evolution has, over the millennia, brought about slow changes that have converted simple one-celled organisms to complex multi-celled ones and generated the earth’s incredible diversity of life forms. The classification system attempts to reflect the evolutionary relationships between organisms.

Initially this classification was based only on the appearance of the organism. However, the development of new techniques has advanced our scientific knowledge. The light microscope and later the electron microscope have enabled us to view the smallest structures, and now techniques for comparing DNA have begun to clarify still further the relationships between organisms. In the light of the advances in knowledge the classification has undergone numerous revisions over time. 

At present most biologists divide the living world into 5 kingdoms, namely: 

* bacteria 
* protists
* fungi
* plants
* animal


We are concerned here almost entirely with the '''Animal Kingdom'''. However, we must not forget that bacteria, protists, and fungi cause many of the serious diseases that affect animals, and all animals rely either directly or indirectly on the plant world for their nourishment.

==The Animal Kingdom==

So what are animals? If we were suddenly confronted with an animal we had never seen in our lives before, how would we know it was not a plant or even a fungus?  We all intuitively know part of the answer to this.	

Animals: 
* eat organic material (plants or other animals)
* move to find food
* take the food into their bodies and then digest it
* and most reproduce by fertilizing eggs by sperm 


If you were tempted to add that animals are furry, run around on four legs and give birth to young that they feed on milk you were thinking only of mammals and forgetting temporarily that frogs, snakes and crocodiles, birds as well as fish, are also animals. 

These are all members of the group called the '''vertebrates''' (or animals with a backbone) and mammals make up only about 8% of this group. The diagram on the next page shows the percentage of the different kinds of vertebrates.

[[Image:Proportions of different kinds of vertebrate.JPG|center]]

However, the term animal includes much more than just the Vertebrates. In fact this group makes up only a very small portion of all animals. Take a look at the diagram below, which shows the size of the different groups of animals in the Animal Kingdom as proportions of the total number of different animal species. Notice the small size of the segment representing vertebrates!  All the other animals in the Animal Kingdom are animals with no backbone, or '''invertebrates'''. This includes the worms, sea anemones, starfish, snails, crabs, spiders and insects. As more than 90% of the invertebrates are insects, no wonder people worry that insects may take over the world one day!

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals-Invertebrates&amp;vertebrates pie graph.jpg|center]]

==The Classification Of Vertebrates==
As we have seen above the Vertebrates are divided into 5 groups or classes namely:

* Fish
* Amphibia  (frogs and toads)
* Reptiles  (snakes and crocodiles)
* Birds
* Mammals


These classes are all based on similarities. For instance all mammals have a similar skeleton, hair on their bodies, are warm bodied and suckle their young. 

The class Mammalia (the mammals) contains 3 '''subclasses''':  

* Duck billed platypus and the spiny anteater 
* '''Marsupials'''  (animals like the kangaroo with pouches) 
* '''True mammals'''  (with a placenta) 


Within the subclass containing the true mammals, there are groupings called '''orders''' that contain mammals that are more closely similar or related, than others.  Examples of six mammalian orders are given below:	

* Rodents (Rodentia) (rats and mice) 
* Carnivores (Carnivora) (cats, dogs, bears and seals)
* Even-toed grazers  (Artiodactyla)  (pigs, sheep, cattle, antelopes)
* Odd-toed grazers  (Perissodactyla)  (horses, donkeys, zebras)
* Marine mammals  (Cetacea)  (whales, sea cows)
* Primates  (monkeys, apes, humans)


Within each order there are various '''families'''. For example within the carnivore mammals are the families:

* Canidae  (dog-like carnivores)
* Felidae  (cat-like carnivores)


Even at this point it is possible to find groupings that are more closely related than others. These groups are called '''genera''' (singular genus). For instance within the cat family Felidae is the genus Felis containing the cats, as well as genera containing panthers, lynxes, and sabre toothed tigers! 

The final groups within the system are the '''species'''. The definition of a species is a '''group of animals that can mate successfully and produce fertile offspring'''. This means that all domestic cats belong to the species ''Felis domesticus'', because all breeds of cat whether Siamese, Manx or ordinary House hold cat can cross breed. However, domestic cats can not mate successfully with lions, tigers or jaguars, so these are placed in separate species, e.g. ''Felis leo, Felis tigris and Felis onca''. 

Even within the same species, there can be animals with quite wide variations in appearance that still breed successfully. We call these different '''breeds, races''' or '''varieties'''. For example there are many different breeds of dogs from Dalmatian to Chihuahua and of cats, from Siamese to Manx and domestic short-hairs, but all can cross breed.  Often these breeds have been produced by''' selective breeding''' but varieties can arise in the wild when groups of animals are separated by a mountain range or sea and have developed different characteristics over long periods of time. 

To summarise, the classification system consists of:

The '''A'''nimal '''K'''ingdom which is divided into

'''P'''hyla which are divided into

'''C'''lasses which are divided into

'''O'''rders which are divided into 

'''F'''amilies which are divided into 

'''G'''enera which are divided into 

'''S'''pecies.


“'''Kings Play Cricket On Flat Green Surfaces'''” OR “'''Kindly Professors Cannot Often Fail Good Students'''” are just two of the phrases students use to remind themselves of the order of these categories - on the other hand  you might like to invent your own.

==Summary==
* The '''scientific name''' of an animal has two parts, the '''genus''' and the '''species''', and must be written in '''italics''' or '''underlined'''.
* Animals are divided into '''vertebrates''' and '''invertebrates'''.
* The classification system has groupings called '''phyla''', '''classes''', '''orders''', '''families''', '''genera''' and '''species'''.
* Furry, milk-producing animals are all in the class '''Mammalia.'''
* Members within a '''species''' can mate and produce fertile offspring.
* Sub-groups within a species include '''breeds, races''' and '''varieties'''.

==The Cell== 
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals variety animal cells.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.1''': A variety of animal cells]]
The cell is the basic building block of living organisms. Bacteria and the parasite that causes malaria consist of single cells, while plants and animals are made up of trillions of cells. Most cells are spherical or cube shaped but some are a range of different shapes (see diagram 3.1). 

Most cells are so small that a microscope is needed to see them, although a few cells, e.g. the ostrich’s egg, are so large that they could make a meal for several people. 

A normal cell is about 0.02 of a millimetre (0.02mm) in diameter. (Small distances like this are normally expressed in micrometres or microns (μm). Note there are 1000 μms in every mm).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals an animal cell.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.2''': An animal cell]]

When you look at a typical animal cell with a light microscope it seems quite simple with only a few structures visible (see diagram 3.2).

Three main parts can be seen: 

* an outer cell membrane (plasma membrane), 
* an inner region called the cytoplasm and 
* the nucleus 
{{clear}}
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals animal cell electron microscope.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.3''': An animal cell as seen with an electron microscope]]

However, when you use an electron microscope to increase the magnification many thousands of times you see that these seemingly simple structures are incredibly complex, each with its own specialized function.   For example the plasma membrane is seen to be a double layer and the cytoplasm contains many special structures called '''organelles''' (meaning little organs) which are described below.   A drawing of the cell as seen with an electron microscope is shown in diagram 3.3. 
{{clear}}
==The Plasma Membrane==
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals structure plasma membrane.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.4''':  The structure of the plasma membrane]]

The thin plasma membrane surrounds the cell, separating its contents from the surroundings and controlling what enters and leaves the cell.  The plasma membrane is composed of two main molecules,phospholipids(fats) and proteins.  The phospholipids are arranged in a double layer with the large protein molecules dotted about in the membrane (see diagram 3.4). Some of the protein molecules form tiny channels in the membrane while others help transport substances from one side of the membrane to the other.
{{clear}}
===How substances move across the Plasma Membrane===
Substances need to pass through the membrane to enter or leave the cell and they do so in a number of ways. Some of these processes require no energy i.e. they are passive, while others require energy i.e. they are '''active'''. 

Passive processes include: a) diffusion and b) osmosis, while active processes include: c) active transport, d) phagocytosis, e) pinocytosis and f) exocytosis. These will be described below. 

[[Image:Diffusion in a liquid.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.5''': Diffusion in a liquid]]
'''a) Diffusion'''

Although you may not know it, you are already familiar with the process of diffusion. It is diffusion that causes a smell (expensive perfume or smelly socks) in one part of the room to gradually move through the room so it can be smelt on the other side. Diffusion occurs in the air and in liquids. 

Diagram 3.5 shows what happens when a few crystals of a dark purple dye called potassium permanganate are dropped into a beaker of water. The dye molecules diffuse into the water moving from high to low concentrations so they become evenly distributed throughout the beaker.

In the body, diffusion causes molecules that are in a high concentration on one side of the cell membrane to move across the membrane until they are present in equal concentrations on both sides. It takes place because all molecules have an in-built vibration that causes them to move and collide until they are evenly distributed. It is an absolutely natural process that requires no added energy. 

Small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and ammonia as well as fats, diffuse directly through the double fat layer of the membrane. The small molecules named above as well as a variety of charged particles (ions) also diffuse through the protein-lined channels. Larger molecules like glucose attach to a carrier molecule that aids their diffusion through the membrane. This is called '''facilitated diffusion'''.	 

In the animal’s body diffusion is important for moving oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the blood, for moving digested food molecules from the gut into the blood and for the removal of waste products from the cell. 
{{clear}}
[[Image:Osmosis experiment.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.6''': Osmosis]]
'''b) Osmosis'''

Although the word may be unfamiliar, you are almost certainly acquainted with the effects of osmosis. It is osmosis that plumps out dried fruit when you soak it before making a fruit cake or makes that wizened old carrot look almost like new when you soak it in water. Osmosis is in fact the diffusion of water across a membrane that allows water across but not larger molecules. This kind of membrane is called a '''semi-permeable membrane'''. 

Take a look at side '''A''' of diagram 3.6. It shows a container divided into two parts by an artificial semi-permeable membrane. Water is poured into one part while a solution containing salt is poured into the other part.  Water can cross the membrane but the salt cannot.  The water crosses the semi-permeable membrane by diffusion until there is an equal amount of water on both sides of the membrane. The effect of this would be to make the salt solution more diluted and cause the level of the liquid in the right-hand side of the container to rise so it looked like side ''' B''' of diagram 3.6. This movement of water across the semi-permeable membrane is called osmosis. It is a completely natural process that requires no outside energy. 

Although it would be difficult to do in practice, imagine that you could now take a plunger and push down on the fluid in the right-hand side of container '''B''' so that it flowed back across the semi-permeable membrane until the level of fluid on both sides was equal again. If you could measure the pressure required to do this, this would be equal to the '''osmotic pressure''' of the salt solution.  (This is a rather advanced concept at this stage but you will meet this term again when you study fluid balance later in the course).
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals-osmosis-red cell-hypotonic.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.7''': Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypotonic solution]]

The plasma membrane of cells acts as a semi-permeable membrane. If red blood cells, for example, are placed in water, the water crosses the membrane to make the amount of water on both sides of it equal (see diagram 3.7). This means that the water moves into the cell causing it to swell. This can occur to such an extent that the cell actually bursts to release its contents. This bursting of red blood cells is called '''haemolysis'''. In a situation such as this when the solution on one side of a semi-permeable membrane has a lower concentration than that on the other side, the first solution is said to be '''hypotonic''' to the second.
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals-osmosis-red cell-hypertonic.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.8''': Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypertonic solution]]

Now think what would happen if red blood cells were placed in a salt solution that has a higher salt concentration than the solution within the cells (see diagram 3.8). Such a bathing solution is called a '''hypertonic''' solution. In this situation the “concentration” of water within the cells would be higher than that outside the cells. Osmosis (diffusion of water) would then occur from the inside of the cells to the outside solution, causing the cells to shrink.

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals-osmosis red cellisotonic.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.9''': Red cells placed in an isotonic solution]]

A solution that contains 0.9% salt has the same concentration as body fluids and the solution within red cells. Cells placed in such a solution would neither swell nor shrink (see diagram 3.9). This solution is called an '''isotonic''' solution. This strength of salt solution is often called '''normal saline''' and is used when replacing an animal’s body fluids or when cells like red blood cells have to be suspended in fluid.

'''Remember''' - osmosis is a special kind of diffusion. It is the diffusion of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane. It is a completely passive process and requires no energy. 

Sometimes it is difficult to remember which way the water molecules move. Although it is not strictly true in a biological sense, many students use the phrase '''“SALT SUCKS”''' to help them remember which way water moves across the membrane when there are two solutions of different salt 
concentrations on either side.  

As we have seen water moves in and out of the cell by osmosis. All water movement from the 
intestine into the blood system and between the blood capillaries and the fluid around the cells 
(tissue or extra cellular fluid) takes place by osmosis. Osmosis is also important in the production of concentrated urine by the kidney. 

'''c) Active transport'''

When a substance is transported from a low concentration to a high concentration i.e. uphill against the concentration gradient, energy has to be used. This is called '''active transport'''. 

Active transport is important in maintaining different concentrations of the ions sodium and potassium on either side of the nerve cell membrane.  It is also important for removing valuable molecules such as glucose, amino acids and sodium ions from the urine.

[[Image:Phagocytosis.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.10''': Phagocytosis]]

'''d) Phagocytosis'''

Phagocytosis is sometimes called “cell eating”. It is a process that requires energy and is used by cells to move solid particles like bacteria across the plasma membrane. Finger-like projections from the plasma membrane surround the bacteria and engulf them as shown in diagram 3.10. 
Once within the cell, enzymes produced by the lysosomes of the cell (described later) destroy the bacteria. 

The destruction of bacteria and other foreign substance by white blood cells by the process of phagocytosis is a vital part of the defense mechanisms of the body. 

'''e) Pinocytosis'''

Pinocytosis or “cell drinking” is a very similar process to phagocytosis but is used by cells to move fluids across the plasma membrane.  Most cells carry out pinocytosis (note the pinocytotic vesicle in diagram 3.3). 

'''f) Exocytosis'''

Exocytosis is the process by means of which substances formed in the cell are moved through the plasma membrane into the fluid outside the cell (or extra-cellular fluid). It occurs in all cells but is most important in secretory cells (e.g. cells that produce digestive enzymes) and nerve cells.
{{clear}}

==The Cytoplasm==
Within the plasma membrane is the '''cytoplasm'''. It consists of a clear jelly-like fluid called the 
a) '''cytosol''' or '''intracellular fluid''' in which b) '''cell inclusions''', c) '''organelles''' and d) '''microfilaments''' and '''microtubules''' are found. 

===a) Cytosol=== 
The cytosol consists mainly of water in which various molecules are dissolved or suspended. These molecules include proteins, fats and carbohydrates as well as sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride ions.  Many of the reactions that take place in the cell occur in the cytosol. 

===b) Cell inclusions===
These are large particles of fat, glycogen and melanin that have been produced by the cell. They are often large enough to be seen with the light microscope. For example the cells of adipose tissue (as in the insulating fat layer under the skin) contain fat that takes up most of the cell. 

===c) Organelles===
'''Organelles''' are the “little organs” of the cell - like the heart, kidney and liver are the organs of the body. They are structures with characteristic appearances and specific “jobs” in the cell.  Most can not be seen with the light microscope and so it was only when the electron microscope was developed that they were discovered. The main organelles in the cell are the '''ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, Golgi complex''' and  '''lysosomes'''.  A cell containing these organelles as seen with the electron microscope is shown in diagram 3.3.

====Ribosomes====
[[Image:Rough endoplasmic reticulum.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.11''': Rough endoplasmic reticulum]]
'''Ribosomes''' are tiny spherical organelles that make proteins by joining amino acids together.  Many ribosomes are found free in the cytosol, while others are attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

====Endoplasmic reticulum====
The '''endoplasmic reticulum (ER)''' is a network of membranes that form channels throughout the cytoplasm from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. Various molecules are made in the ER and transported around the cell in its channels. There are two types of ER: smooth ER and rough ER.

::'''Smooth ER''' is where the fats in the cell are made and in some cells, where chemicals like alcohol, pesticides and carcinogenic molecules are inactivated. 

::The '''Rough ER''' has ribosomes attached to its surface. The function of the Rough ER is therefore to make proteins that are modified stored and transported by the ER (Diagram 3.11).
{{clear}}
====Mitochondria====
[[Image:Mitochondrion.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.12''': A mitochondrion]]
'''Mitochondria''' (singular mitochondrion) are oval or rod shaped organelles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. They consist of two membranes, the inner one of which is folded to increase its surface area. (Diagram 3.12)

Mitochondria are the “power stations” of the cell. They make energy by “burning” food molecules like glucose. This process is called '''cellular respiration'''. The reaction requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide which is a waste product. The process is very complex and takes place in a large number of steps but the overall word equation for cellular respiration is-

::::'''Glucose + oxygen = carbon dioxide + water + energy'''

'''Note''' that cellular respiration is different from respiration or breathing. Breathing is the means by which air is drawn into and expelled from the lungs. Breathing is necessary to supply the cells with the oxygen required by the mitochondria and to remove the carbon dioxide produced as a waste product of cellular respiration. 

Active cells like muscle, liver, kidney and sperm cells have large numbers of mitochondria.
{{clear}}
====Golgi Apparatus====
[[Image:Golgi body.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.13''': A Golgi body]]

The '''Golgi bodies''' in a cell together make up the '''Golgi apparatus'''. Golgi bodies are found near the nucleus and consist of flattened membranes stacked on top of each other rather like a pile of plates (see diagram 3.13). The Golgi apparatus modifies and sorts the proteins and fats made by the ER, then surrounds them in a membrane as '''vesicles''' so they can be moved to other parts of the cell.

====Lysosomes====

'''Lysosomes''' are large vesicles that contain digestive enzymes. These break down bacteria and other substances that are brought into the cell by phagocytosis or pinocytosis. They also digest worn-out or damaged organelles, the components of which can then be recycled by the cell to make new structures.

===d) Microfilaments And Microtubules===

Some cells can move and change shape and organelles and chemicals are moved around the cell. Threadlike structures called '''microfilaments''' and '''microtubules''' that can contract are responsible for this movement. 

These structures also form the projections from the plasma membrane known as '''flagella''' (singular flagellum) as in the sperm tail, and '''cilia''' found lining the respiratory tract and used to remove mucus that has trapped dust particles (see chapter 4). 

Microtubules also form the pair of cylindrical structures called '''centrioles''' found near the nucleus. These help organise the spindle used in cell division.

==The Nucleus==
[[Image:Chromosomes.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.14''': A cell with an enlarged chromosome]]
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals-human chromosome.jpg|frame|right|'''Diagram 3.15''': A full set of human chromosomes]]

The '''nucleus''' is the largest structure in a cell and can be seen with the light microscope. It is a spherical or oval body that contains the '''chromosomes'''. The nucleus controls the development and activity of the cell. Most cells contain a nucleus although mature red blood cells have lost theirs during development and some muscle cells have several nuclei. 

A double membrane similar in structure to the plasma membrane surrounds the nucleus (now called the nuclear envelope). Pores in this nuclear membrane allow communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. 

Within the nucleus one or more spherical bodies of darker material can be seen, even with the light microscope. These are called '''nucleoli''' and are made of RNA. Their role is to make new ribosomes. 

===Chromosomes===
Inside the nucleus are the chromosomes which:
* contain DNA;
* control the activity of the cell; 
* are transmitted from cell to cell when cells divide;  
* are passed to a new individual when sex cells fuse together in sexual  reproduction. 

In cells that are not dividing the chromosomes are very long and thin and appear as dark grainy material. They become visible just before a cell divides when they shorten and thicken and can then be counted (see diagram 3.14).

The number of chromosomes in the cells of different species varies but is constant in the cells of any one species (e.g. horses have 64 chromosomes, cats have 38 and humans 46). Chromosomes occur in pairs (i.e. 32 pairs in the horse nucleus and 19 in that of the cat). Members of each pair are identical in length and shape and if you look carefully at diagram 3.15, you may be able to see some of the pairs in the human set of chromosomes.

==Cell Division==
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals-cell division mitosis.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.16''': Division by mitosis results in 2 new cells identical to each other and to parent cell]]
[[Image:Meiosis.JPG|thumb|400px|'''Diagram 3.17''': Division by meiosis results in 4 new cells that are genetically different to each other]]

Cells divide when an animal grows, when its body repairs an injury and when it produces sperm and eggs (or ova). There are two types of cell division: '''Mitosis''' and '''meiosis'''.			

'''Mitosis'''. This is the cell division that occurs when an animal grows and when tissues are repaired or replaced.  It produces two new cells (daughter cells) each with a full set of chromosomes that are identical to each other and to the parent cell. All the cells of an animal’s body therefore contain identical DNA.

'''Meiosis.''' This is the cell division that produces the ova and sperm necessary for sexual reproduction. It only occurs in the ovary and testis. 

The most important function of meiosis it to halve the number of chromosomes so that when the sperm fertilises the ovum the normal number is regained.  Body cells with the full set of chromosomes are called '''diploid''' cells, while '''gametes''' (sperm and ova) with half the chromosomes are called '''haploid''' cells. 

Meiosis is a more complex process than mitosis as it involves two divisions one after the other and the four cells  produced are all genetically different from each other and from the parent cell.  

This fact that the cells formed by meiosis are all genetically different from each other and from the parent cell can be seen in litters of kittens where all the members of the litter are different from each other as well as being different from the parents although they display characteristics of both.
{{clear}}
==The Cell As A Factory== 
To make the function of the parts of the cell easier to understand and remember you can compare them to a factory. For example: 

* The nucleus (1) is the managing director of the factory consulting the blueprint (the chromosomes) (2); 
* The mitochondria (3) supply the power
* The ribosomes (4) make the products;
* The chloroplasts  of plant cells (5) supply the fuel (food) 
* The Golgi apparatus (6) packages the products ready for dispatch;
* The ER (7) modifies, stores and transports the products around the factory;
* The plasma membrane is the factory wall and the gates (8);
* The lysosomes dispose of the waste and worn-out machinery.

[http://www.harunyahya.com/images_books/images_Dna/1.jpg The cell compared to a factory]

==Summary==
* Cells consist of three parts: the '''plasma membrane, cytoplasm''' and '''nucleus'''.
* Substances pass through the plasma membrane by '''diffusion''' (gases, lipids), '''osmosis''' (water), '''active transport''' (glucose, ions), '''phagocytosis''' (particles), '''pinocytosis''' (fluids) and '''exocytosis''' (particles and fluids). 
* '''Osmosis''' is the diffusion of '''water''' through a '''semipermeable membrane'''. Water diffuses from high water &quot;concentration&quot; to low water &quot;concentration&quot;. 
* The cytoplasm consists of '''cytosol''' in which are suspended '''cell inclusions''' and '''organelles'''. 
* organelles include '''ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi bodies''' and '''lysosomes'''. 
* The '''nucleus''' controls the activity of the cell. It contains the '''chromosomes''' that are composed of '''DNA'''.  
* The cell divides by '''mitosis''' and '''meiosis'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to play chess in serious competition, beyond the casual play, you may want to play in '''tournaments'''. The strength of the tournament players can vary greatly from tournament to tournament, as well as within the tournament.

==Types of tournament==
Common tournament forms include
*Master tournaments are usually closed events where very strong players are invited to play against each other. As a new player, you will probably not wind up in such tournaments for some time (if at all). However, there are frequently side events to a master tournament, open to other players.
*Open tournaments are generally open to any player who has the required memberships, and who want to play. There may be some very strong masters in such tournaments as well, but the list of players usually will include a majority of amateur players. Open tournaments, in particular larger events, may be sectioned, where the lower sections are limited to players with a chess rating below some threshold. How players without ratings are handled may vary from event to event; if in doubt, contact the organizer.
*Scholastic events are tournaments set up for children in school age. They tend to feature faster time controls than the adult events. Children in school age are usually more than welcome to enter adult tournaments, although the youngest children, or those with little or no tournament experience may find themselves outclassed in such events.

Some tournaments may be arranged over one day with several fast games being played (or a small number of rounds). Some are arranged over the course of a weekend. Larger international tournaments are frequently a week long, with one round a day. Club tournaments may last over several months, with an evening round each week.

===Tournament formats===
The most common tournament formats are ''round robins'' and ''Swiss systems''. The round-robin is an all-play-all event, usually in small sections. You will during the course of a round-robin meet everyone else in the section.

Perhaps even more common is the Swiss system, where you in each round meet a player who has a score similar to your score. So if you have lost your first game, you will most likely meet another player who lost the first game as well for the next round. You are never ''eliminated'' from a Swiss system event, if there are an odd number of players the worst that can happen is that you receive a &quot;bye&quot;, which means you get a free point (as if you won a game) instead of a game for that particular round. The bye is generally awarded to a player in the lowest score group, but a player can only receive one of them. In some events the organizer may arrange for an extra game for the player who got a bye.

==Where to find tournaments==
Most countries have a national chess federation or association, and their websites usually have notes about tournaments.

For the United States tournament announcements may be found on the USCF website's [http://main.uschess.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=199 tournament search engine], but it does not list all events, smaller events are often not listed. Websites of the state affiliates may include more local events). For other countries you can find links to the national chess federations [http://www.fide.com/official/directory.asp here].

==Requirements for entering a tournament==
===Rules===
You should be sure you know how the pieces move, and how a game ends. In particular, you need to know the rules of ''en passant'', ''castling'', ''pawn promotion'' and the ''three-time repetition of position'' rule. 

You should know how the chess clock is used. In all tournaments you have to complete your moves within a time limit, which varies from tournament to tournament.

Furthermore, you should know [[Chess/Notating The Game|how to record the game]] using algebraic chess notation. Most tournaments with reasonably long time limits require players to keep score of the game. This is not an absolute requirement, players who are unable to keep score for various reasons, be they religious or due to an inability to write, may be exempted. Additionally, players who are in time trouble (with less than five minutes on their clocks) can be temporarily excused from writing moves to conserve time, although they are encouraged to update their scoresheets with the opponent's score if/when a time control is reached.

In tournament play, the touch-move rule is strictly enforced. If you touch a piece of your own you must move it (if you have a legal move), when you've released the piece after a move it stays. If you touch your opponents piece you must capture it, provided that you have a legal capture. If you merely wish to adjust a piece which is standing askew on the square, you may do so if you warn your opponent (&quot;I adjust&quot; is fine, but the French &quot;J'adoube&quot; is also popular) ''before'' you touch the piece.

Remember that tournaments can, and should, be fun, but they are pretty formal events. Distracting or disturbing your opponent is prohibited. In addition, you should refrain from talking in the tournament hall as much as possible. If you have to communicate something to someone, do it as quietly and discreetly as possible. If, after finishing a game, you and your opponent want to go over it, go to a different room to analyse instead of remaining in the playing hall pushing pieces around - it distracts nearby players.

''Remember to turn mobile phones off before the game starts!'' If a mobile phone rings during the game, a penalty is usually assessed by the arbiter, depending on the tournament. In most USCF tournaments, for a first offence ten minutes is removed from the offending player's clock, and for a second offence the game is forfeited as a loss. The FIDE laws which most other countries play by are even more strict: if a player's mobile phone makes a sound in the playing venue, then that player loses. There is nothing more embarrassing than the ''faux pas'' of a loud ringtone going off in an otherwise dead silent playing hall and half a dozen people from nearby boards glaring at you.

From 2009, the general rule at serious, professional tournaments about arriving late to the board is a zero tolerance policy. If you are not present at the board when the round starts, you forfeit the game. This has sometimes been enforced in a draconian fashion, one player in the Chinese Championship who was standing near the board waiting for the game to start was forfeited when the round started because she wasn't ''sitting'' at the board [http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/16-year-old-ding-liren-wins-chinese-championship/]. A tournament may announce a more lenient rule where a latecomer is forfeited only if a certain time elapses (one hour was the limit before the rule change in 2009), and some federations have announced that one hour will remain the default standard for all tournaments in their country (such as the USCF). However, even if arriving late does not forfeit the game automatically, your clock ''will'' be started on time, so unless you are willing to waste the time you have for thinking, '''don't be late for your game'''.

Full laws can be read [http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=124&amp;view=article here]. (Note that the United States have slightly different tournament regulations.)

===Membership===
In most events, it is required that you are a member of the country's chess association. In the United States, this means that you must be a member of the United States Chess Federation and so on. Some events may require further memberships, club championships may require membership in that club for instance.

For many events in Europe, membership in any national chess federation associated with FIDE may be sufficient (this allows foreign players to play without purchasing new memberships all the time.)

===Equipment===
In most tournaments in the United States, players are expected to provide boards, sets and clocks. Pieces should be of normal Staunton design, with a king about 3-and-a-half inches to 4 inches tall, and the board should have squares of around 2 to 2-and-a-half inches. A cheap roll-up board with normal plastic pieces is quite sufficient. Clocks can be purchased in many places, and the prices can vary. Shop around.

Some sets include an extra pair of queens, so that one can handle the situation where a player gets two queens due to pawn promotion. While helpful, this is not essential. In tournaments, multiple queens should be handled by fetching an additional queen, and ''not'' by placing an overturned rook in place of a queen. The situation is fairly rare in practice however, and when it does happen, you can usually borrow a queen from someone else.

In Europe equipment is usually provided, though some events may have a shortage of clocks, and ask players to provide that.

Bring a pen to write with so that you can keep score.

==General advice for play==
*Remember that tournament play is a learning experience. After the game try to go through the game with your opponent so that you can learn from mistakes made. Do this especially when you have lost, because here you must have done something wrong where your opponent did something right, and you should try avoid losing the same way again.
*Inexperienced players sometimes get distracted by the clock, and start playing too fast. If you have two hours available to make 40 moves, but have only used thirty minutes when the 40 moves are up, you have probably played too quickly and consequently not thought the position through well enough.
*If you get a winning position, be careful! Your opponent will in all likelihood be looking for ways in which you can go wrong, letting him escape with a draw or turn the tables and win.

==Withdrawing==
Try to complete the tournament, even if you have started badly. The opposition will tend to get easier, and learning how to bounce back after setbacks is important.

If you must withdraw, you must tell the organizer that you are going to do so. Otherwise the player you would have met will be deprived of a game. (That player gets awarded a full-point as if the game were won, but the entry fee was probably payed for an opportunity to play chess, not to sit at a table with nobody to play with!) In some cases, a player dropping out without informing the organizer, may face a fine, and be excluded from that organizer's future events until the fine is payed.

==Ratings==
Tournament players are after a stipulated number of games assigned a rating, which is an ''estimate'' for the strength of that player. This goes up and down depending on the player's performance in rated events. The average rating of a tournament player is around 1400, the strongest grandmasters have ratings in the excess of 2700. As a rule of thumb, a player with a rating 200 points higher than the opponent should expect to score 75% against that opponent, and 90% against someone rated 400 points lower, but upsets are in practice more common than what the rating formulas predict.

Understand that an average tournament player of 1400 is, compared to a casual player who only knows the rules, but with no tournament experience or study of the game, a very strong player indeed. A new player who enters a tournament may easily find the first rating to be below 1000, but as experience is gained this may rise!

Remember, ratings are only estimates of playing strength based on past events. Ratings do not measure a person's ability to improve, they are not rewards in themselves, and they are definitely not measures of self-worth.

In tournament play, ratings determine what sections you are eligible to play in, and which opponents you will meet in Swiss system events.

==Glossary of terms==
*'''Arbiter''' or '''tournament director''' is the authority which referees the event, makes pairings, and rulings.
*'''Board 1, board 2, etc.'''. In Swiss system events boards are numbered. The players who currently have the best scores are seated at board no. 1, while those with the weakest scores are seated further down.
*'''Class prize'''. A prize awarded to a player for finishing at the top of his or her rating class. A prize could be awarded for instance for &quot;first place among those rated below 1600&quot;.
*'''Entry fee'''. The amount a player is charged in order to be allowed to participate.
*'''Flag'''. On analog chess clocks, the flag is a small device attached just left of the &quot;12&quot; on the clock face. As the minute hand approaches 12, it lifts the flag up so that it falls once the minute hand passes 12. This '''flag fall''' makes it possible to determine exactly when the time has expired. For example, if each player has 90 minutes, the clocks are initially set at 4:30, and the time has expired when the flag falls when the clock is at 6:00. (Technically, the flag also falls at 5:00, but this has no consequence.) Digital clocks usually have some indicator marking expiry, and the indicator when this is activated is also called a &quot;flag fall&quot;. If the time control stipulates that a certain number of moves be made within a time limit, the last required move must be completed, and the clock stopped, before flag fall, otherwise that player has overstepped the time limit.
*'''Forfeit loss/forfeit win'''. If a player fails to arrive at the board an hour after the announced starting time, then that player loses by forfeit, and the opponent receives a forfeit win. The game counts for tournament standings, but not rating. A person who loses by forfeit is typically removed from the tournament, unless an adequate excuse is provided. A player who has received a win by forfeit is ineligible for receiving a full-point bye in future rounds.
*'''Full-point bye''' or '''walkover'''. If there is an odd number of players for a round, the arbiter will award a full-point bye to one player who does not play that particular round, but instead receives a point as if a game was won.
*'''Half-point bye'''. In some tournaments, a player who is unable to play a particular round may elect to take a half-point bye. The player does not play that round but receives a half-point instead as if a game were drawn. Tournaments frequently regulate such byes, putting a cap on how many can be taken and/or requiring that a player commit to taking them before a certain deadline.
*'''Increment'''. A small amount of time (the increment) which is added to a player's clock at every move. This avoids frantic time scrambles by ensuring that there will always be enough time to make a move. Some tournaments stipulate a time limit with an increment, others do not. Games played with an increment require a digital chess clock with this capability.
*'''J'adoube'''. French for &quot;I adjust&quot;, and can be said by a player before touching a piece to adjust it rather than move it.
*'''Sandbagging'''. A fraudulent scheme where a player deliberately lowers his rating so that he may play in a lower rated section sometime in the future in order to win cash prizes. Sandbagging is a form of cheating, and people caught may face stiff sanctions.
*'''Sudden death'''. A time limit where one must make all remaining moves in a set amount of time. A time limit of &quot;40/90, SD/30&quot; means that each player must complete 40 moves in 90 minutes (that is the non-sudden death control), and then the remaining moves in 30 minutes (plus any time left over from the first time control), this second phase is the sudden death phase.
*'''Swiss-system'''. An tournament format where players face other players with same or similar scores in each round.
*'''Time control'''. The number of moves one must make within the time limit. For example if one must make 35 moves in 90 minutes, the time control is at 35 moves.
*'''Time delay'''. A small amount of time (the delay) which passes before the clock starts deducting time from a player at every move. No time is deducted if a player moves before the delay is up. The idea is similar to that of an increment, but a player cannot build up a reservoir of time. Games played with a delay require a digital chess clock with this capability. In the United States, a five second time delay is standard, and clocks which have the delay capability are preferred over clocks which do not.

Hi there.

I see you've uploaded a bunch of images, which are attributed to Ruth Lawson. Is that you? If not, please provide a source so we can verify that the images are licensed as you say they are. For the future, please note that images need both a license tag ''and'' a source (usually a URL to wherever you got the image). Thanks!

:You were really diligent with the license templates on all those images, but you did miss a few. Click the ''unlicensed'' tab at the top of this page to see your unlicensed images. Remember: you must edit the image description page directly to change the license template (don't re-upload the image). Thanks!

== Anatomy and Physiology of Animals ==

I've been watching some of your edits to this book, and I think you are doing a really good job. Don't worry about all the image copyright issues, copyright can be a tricky subject for people to really master. The most important thing you can do is to really read the instructions on the image upload page, and ask questions about anything you aren't familiar with. 

If you have any questions, or if you need any help with anything, let me know. You're doing good, keep up the good work! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:23, 26 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

If you have any questions about the Muggle's Guide in particular (specifically how we write things here and our set of standards), please leave me a message at my talk page. 

I notice you've been doing some editing to the Muggles' Guide recently, and I do appreciate that. Would it be possible to perhaps be a bit more complete in your article sections? In particular, the bald statement &quot;tonks dies&quot; in the writeup for Nymphadora Tonks under Deathly Hallows is accurate, but it leaves out so much... she has married Remus, she is one of the Order members who helps Harry escape from Privet Drive, the feud between her and Bellatrix, she attends Harry's birthday but has to depart hurriedly when Scrimgeour arrives, she attends the wedding, announces her pregnancy; the byplay with Remus going adventuring with Harry; the birth of Teddy; and the fact (mentioned in a later interview with Rowling) that it is Bellatrix who finally managed to kill her. All of that properly belongs in that section...

Thanks. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:11, 13 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

The '''diet''' is all the food taken in by an individual over a period of time.
Food provides us with energy for metabolic functions and all the chemicals needed for life (nutrients).

Below is a list of the 5 major nutrients included in the diet, some examples of here to find them, and what they are needed for:

'''Carbohydrates''' are found in honey, grapes, cane sugar, milk, bread and liver. The main function of carbohydrates is to provide energy that can be released rapidly in cell respiration.

'''Proteins''' are found in beef, salmon, seeds, peanuts and tofu. Proteins are used for protein synthesis - for cell and tissue growth, regeneration of hair, skin and red blood cells.

'''Lipids''' are found in oily fish, nuts and fatty meats. Lipids contain more energy per gram than carbohydrates and form the body's main energy stores in adipose tissue. Fats act as a thermal insulator to the body. Phospholipids are the main constituents of the membranes.

'''Nutrients''' are chemical substances (elements or compounds) found in foods that are needed by the human body. All nutrients including essential fatty acids, essential amino acids, minerals, vitamins, water must be obtained from the food consumed because these substances cannot be synthesized by the human body. Non-essential fatty and amino acids can both be synthesized from essential fatty and amino acids by the human body. Carbohydrates are a source of energy, however lipids and proteins can be used for energy and therefore carbohydrates are not classified as nutrients.

'''Minerals''' are found in a range of fresh foods. Apart from C, H and O at least 20 minerals are essential in the diet, each with specific use. Deficiencies cause ill health.

'''Vitamins''' are found in a range of fresh foods, and vitamin D is manufactured by the body when sunlight hits the skin. 13 different compunds have been identified, each with a specific use. Definciencies cause ill health.


Vitamins and minerals are sometimes called micronutrients because they are needed in very small quantities compared to the three macronutrients. However, they cannot be synthesised by the body and a definciency can cause ill health.

In addition to the macro- and micronutrients, water is essential in the diet.


A '''balanced diet''' supplies the energy and nutrients the body needs and no more. Supplying a balanced diet is achieving an equilibrium (balance) between energy intake and expenditure.

Individuals vary in their energy requirements.
Factors influencing how much energy is needed by an individual are:

'''Age''': more energy is needed up with increasing age up to adulthood as the body grows larger.

'''Gender''': females use less energy than males.

'''Activity''': physical activity involves energy expenditure.

'''Condition''': extra energy is needed during growth spurts, pregnancy, breast-feeding, illnesses and some other conditions.


Diets containing excessive amounts of energy cause obesity.

Nutrient requirements also vary with age, gender and other factors (pregnancy, diet etc).

      <comment>Define subject and alter Christian to Neutral Point of View (NPOV)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is theology?==
Human beings are essentially social animals. Social animals operate in groups, packs or tribes. Usually individuals are linked by family connections to an 'alpha male' who provides tactical leadership. Provided this leadership increases the probability of success for individual members as well as for himself he will earn respect. Humans uniquely have the ability to formulate long-term strategic plans and communicate complex ideas which has made our species the most successful of all living creatures on this planet. Leadership is crucial to human success. The model of parental superiority is implicit from birth, as the infant human is incapable of independent survival. A hierarchical 'chain of command' with delegated responsibilities and privileges thus emerged naturally and early in human history. Ancestor worship is a form of hierarchical deference to wise (but dead) former leaders. 

===Death===
Theories about what happens after death - if there is a human spirit or soul capable of surviving the body is important to people. Should former leaders influence their survivors? Is  there  somewhere an unseen community of the dead or some sort of super-spirit capable of communicating with the living?  These ideas matter because people believe in these theories, and those beliefs, true or false, do indeed alter our behavior according to the expected reward or punishment. A trader trades with the expectation to be paid 'fairly'. If not, then a 'higher authority' - either the police or the judiciary will be expected to apply influence. A religious person may give alms, or take up arms without expectation of any earthly benefit, expecting instead 'a good feeling' now followed by a certain reward 'in heaven'. 

===Life===
Most religions use the 'external influence' of unseen forces to mold habits that led to successful survival. War is a human strategic invention that allows the winning side to take the riches of the losers, who may be killed or enslaved. War is dangerous for individuals, but not for armies or communities as a whole as long as they are successful defenders or colonizers. Individual warriors have to be assured they will receive their reward at the close of battle or else 'in the afterlife' if they are brave and do as they are told without question. The corollary is that if a warrior is cowardly or disobedient he will first be be killed and tormented 'in the afterlife'.   
===The purpose of Religion===
Obviously an individual person who is able to successfully steal from 'outsiders' and enslave 'foreigners' will accumulate worldly wealth and attract predatory competitors. The same is true of criminal gangs and nation states. The successful strategy is therefore to distinguish 'right' and 'wrong' behavior between 'us' within a group and 'them' - our potential victims. As human societies became more complex the definitions of who was 'inside' (warriors certainly, but what about children, wives, slaves, friendly tribes.....?) as well as the context in which 'right' and 'wrong' might be judged and rewarded (or punished) became a problem requiring study and the evolution of clear rules, which we call theology. When may a warrior legally kill? What is 'just cause' war as distinguished from a criminal enterprise.....
== Types of religion==
Religions generally demand respect for parents, elders and certain wise or brave leaders. Hierarchical power structures culminate in monotheism, where a supreme, all-wise, ever-present but undetectable God monitors a believers' every thought and action.  The contrary view is of polytheism, where many gods deny supremacy to any person or deity. Universal democracy is a form of this, since every elector is an individual, but the average of their collective will (eventually) reign supreme. Rather than respecting the personal wishes of a king or president, democrats require their leaders to conform to their collective will, and punish those who abuse their delegated power. Neither absolute personal princely power nor absolute democracy is very efficient, and most societies strike a balance - The United States of America and the Republic of France have powerful presidents, but their term of office is very short. Conversely the monarchs of the Kingdoms of Spain and Britain rule 'for life' but they have very little power or freedom although their experience may lend them a certain moral authority. 

===Religion and Law===
The European Union has a power structure so complex that it is almost beyond understanding, and relies on the free-will of individual nation states to execute its directives, and rewards or punishes member states rather than their individual citizens. European and International Law emerged mostly from the Judeo-Christian traditions iluminated by some notable Muslim interpretations which evolved around the Iberian peninsula. International law is in one sense a form of religion binding in other religions in order to discourage predatory adventures, racism and genocide, whilst equally encouraging communication, trade and individual human rights guaranteed by the state in which people reside. Not all states subscribe to international law, and some that do place their own theocracy or judiciary above international courts. The USA for example does not submit itself to international scrutiny nor require nor allow its citizens to submit to any legal code except its own constitution. Similarly many Muslim countries apply Sharia (interpretive) contextual judgments rather than impose the rather stark international (codified) law.



== Christianity ==
The Creation in Christianity is based in the book of Genesis. Christians believe this book accurately depicts the creation.   
Genesis is  written in a poetic form, and is presumed to have been inspired by God. It illustrates the creation from the point of view of the Jewish culture and its people. There is an argument amongst Christians as to if it was was written as a parable (evolution via intelligent design) or as a literal truth (which creationists aver).
Most holy scripture is both historically ancient and tends to be  in a mythological language style. Genesis first appeared about three thousand years ago in the tenth century Before the Common Epoch (BC) probably during the reign af King Solomon, and it appears to have been written,re-written, translated and reinterpreted by many authors with different intentions. 
Genesis is not a scientific document, since 'the scientific method' was invented much later (in Baghdad around 7th to 10th century After the common epoch (AC)), Therefore, despite the claims of creationists, it could not explain the creation in scientific terms. Genesis is then a religious document that explain certain spiritual ideas which believers accept as 'true' from a religious and spiritual point of view.

There are many different interpretations about the Genesis from many different Christian denominations.

===Historical or spiritual truth?===
One such interpretation would state that although the book of Genesis does contain poetry and other types of literary devices, it is primarily a historical narrative of how God brought about the beginning of the universe, mankind, the beginning of the Chosen nation of Israel and how 'He' (God) set the wheels in motion for the beginning of his grace after mankind brought about the beginning of sin.  It is a book of beginnings, as is reflected in the title of the book, Bereshith (In the beginning).  Furthermore, for believers, it is more than merely a religious document that explains spiritual truths from a religious point of view.  They accept Genesis as a true historical narrative that reveals the reality of who God is, what he has done in history, and where man came from, how mankind fell into sin, the effects of the fall, and how God has chosen to redeem his chosen people through the Jewish people and his covenant, and ultimately, how He set into motion, the redemption of the elect which would eventually be His Church.
Right and wrong behaviors, just rewards and punishments are exemplified throughout the first five scriptural books (Jewish Torah or Christian Pentateuch) of which Genesis is the opening salvo. 
===Interpretation===
There are several points of differing interpretations within Christian Theology about the actual creation narrative itself.  The first debate begins within the very first word of the very first verse: Bereshith.  The problem arises in the interpretation of the translation.  Whereas, it could be translated &quot;In a beginning&quot; (using an indefinite article - one of many), most scholars will translate it as &quot;In the Beginning&quot; (definite article and therefore the unique story).  This may not seem like a big issue until one moves to the second verse and deals with the translation of the Hebrew word, Hayathah.  There are two legitimate translations of this word, which are, &quot;It was&quot; and &quot;It became&quot;.  If one goes with the former translation, it is clear that this is interpreted as one creation that simply continues the narrative of verse one and translates Bereshith as &quot;In the Beginning&quot;.  If one goes with the latter translation, then this would open the possibility for many different creations and the Gap theory, and would continue the narrative of verse one  which translates Bereshith as &quot;In a Beginning&quot;.  While, the Gap Theorists will point to many creation stories in the ancient world outside of the Jewish narrative as evidence of many creations, proponents of one creation will state that the context of the narrative does not lend itself to a Gap Theory.  The primary context of the narrative is not to tell us how many creations there were, but rather, that God is the one who created the beginning and was the one who was before time (eternal).  It further states that the context is to tell us about the beginning of man, sin, God' covenant, and God's law, and God's redemption of sinful man. The purpose of the writers of Genesis has always been to define 'right' and wrong' interactions (bestowing blessings and sins), how we humans may 'justly' reward and punish each other during our lives, and how (post mortem) we will ourselves eventually receive divine justice calculated and delivered 'fairly and utterly' by a unique and omnipotent God who has an exact record of our every passing moment. 

===History or Poetry?===
The next interpretive issue revolves around the chronological or historical timing of creation.  There are scholars who firmly believe  that creation must have occurred no longer than about 12,000 years ago.  This date may be approximately  deduced from the genealogies given later in Genesis, and on a literal interpretation of a seven days of 24 hours cycle of creation.  One of the major reasons that many Christians hold to this interpretation is that they want to deflect the teachings of 'chance' or Darwinian evolution. If creation of life on earth was simply chance then the fossil records and carbon dating techniques  would predate Genesis and date the world back to millions of years. God would then become merely decorative and cultural within human life rather than truly authoritative and believable source of all things and all-knowing. Contrary to Genesis report of mankind created and completed in an instant Darwin would allow for a gradual emergence of each species (including mankind) over millions of years.  Many faithful Christians, however, would argue that the timing is not of primary importance and that Genesis  explains WHY things are as they are, and so is compatible with,  not in conflict with science, which only explains how things may have become as they are. The actual sequence and timing being immaterial to religious purpose.  Whether  mankind emerged within a seven day cycle or over millions of years, the primary purpose if Genesis is to confirm that God is eternal and is the one agent who created everything.  One argument against the seven 24 hour period of time is that the sun and the moon were not apparently created until the fourth day, and these are essential elements in the measurement of time,  the seasons, and the years.  Another argument revolves around the word &quot;Yom&quot; which can be translated either as 'a day' or used to indicate some undefined period of time.  A third argument is based on the New Testament text which clarifies time as it is understood by God (2 Peter 3:8).  One thing is certain in believers minds is that, whether mankind emerged gradually over millions of years or was created in a split second, there was  God who existed before time as we humans understand it, and it was God who created all things in accordance with divine will.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BACKGROUND for the Book of GENESIS account of Creation ==
GENESIS is the first of the five Mosaic books in the Old Testament which together make up the ''Pentateuch''. The name of the book comes from the greek word ''geneseos'' which means 'birth', 'geneology' or 'history of origin'. The name is appropriate as it reflects the main theme of the book: Beginnings.

Genesis was written by Moses, circa 1446 - 1406 B.C. The content and writing style is characteristic of similar manuscripts of that time period. Many similarities and parallelisms in content and lifestyles can be found between Genesis and other important manuscripts such as the Mesopotamian works ''Enuma Elish'', Gilgamesh Epic and Hammurabi's code of Law.

We can estimate the timeframe of writing by referring to the Jewish history in the Book of 1 Kings. 1Ki 6:1 indicates that &quot;In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt,in the fourth year of Solomon's reign...he began to build the temple of the Lord&quot;. We know from historical records that the temple construction began circa 966 BC, putting the exodus of Israel around 1446 BC.

Progress in both Archaeology and Literary research substantiates the authenticity of the Book of Genesis.

The Book of Genesis begins with an account of Creation. This account outlines the sequence in which God creates all things. It starts with the Creations of &quot;the heavens' (note this is plural) and over seven days creation progresses through terrestrial objects, the Earth's form, plants, animals and finally Man. This occurs over a period of seven literal days (morning and evening being part of the narrative for each day).
  

=== A secular perspective ===
The Creation in Christianity is based in the book of Genesis. 
The Christians believe that this book depicts some spiritual concepts about the creation. 
Genesis is described as inspired by God that illustrates the creation from the point of view of the Jewish culture and its people.
It was written around the X century BC. 
The genesis is not a scientific document, therefore it doesn't explain the creation in scientific words, However it is a religious document that explain spiritual truths based from a religious and spiritual point of view.

Nowadays, there are many different interpretations about the Genesis from many different Christian denominations.

(++) = flip $ foldr (:)

==Preface==
The developments in information and communication technologies heralding the ‘information
age’ are marked by the possibilities of greater dissemination of knowledge and culture.Yet at the
same time, stricter copyright laws have created an invisible barrier to knowledge access in the
information age. A number of scholars have used the metaphor of ‘second enclosures’ as a way of
illustrating how the ‘commons’ of knowledge and culture are increasingly being fenced by the
imposition of strict property protections on the intangible domain of intellectual property. It is in
this context that a number of initiatives such as ‘Free Software’ and ‘Open Content’ have emerged.
These initiatives recognize that the future depends on proactively nurturing a vibrant ‘commons’
of knowledge and cultural resources.

The Open Content model of knowledge creation and dissemination has emerged as a significant
way in which we can move beyond the barriers of restrictive licensing.At the same time, it enables
us to rethink our relationship to the world of knowledge and cultural production. Inspired by the
Free Software movement, Open Content seeks to move away from the traditional user/producer
binary in favour of a more participative process of knowledge creation and usage.

This e-Primer introduces the idea of Open Content by locating it within the larger historical
context of copyright’s relation to the public domain. It examines the foundational premises of
copyright and argues that a number of these premises have to be tested on the basis of the
public interest that they purport to serve. It then looks at the ways in which content owners are
increasingly using copyright as a tool to create monopolies, and how an alternative paradigm like
Open Content can facilitate a democratization of knowledge and culture.This e-Primer focuses on
some of the implications for policy makers thinking about information policies, and the
advantages that the Open Content model may offer, especially for developing countries.</text>

While the question of who has control and who has access to knowledge and culture is an
age-old one, it seems to have gained urgency in the context of the ‘information revolution’ of
the past few years.As with all revolutionary moments, older structures of power are challenged
and potentially overturned. In our current era, the information revolution promises a radical
shift in the paradigm of how information, knowledge and culture are produced, disseminated
and accessed. {{focref|1}}

However, this promise must overcome the challenges of severe restrictions that run the risk of
making access to knowledge and culture more difficult for people. This e-Primer will explore
the twin metaphors of perils and promises that society must confront in the future of the
‘information age’. In particular, we will be examining one aspect of this crucial debate, namely
the debate between '''copyright''' and '''Open Content'''.

The argument of this e-Primer will be that policy makers across the world, and particularly in
developing countries, should take note of the advantages of the Open Content paradigm as a
way of overcoming barriers which restrict access to information, knowledge and culture. There
are also significant economic advantages for developing countries which shall be detailed, for
instance in relation to the cost of learning materials.

'''The Emergence of Copyright'''

The transformation of copyright, from an esoteric legal subject to a topic of daily conversation and debate, has occurred in a relatively short span of time.  No account of this contemporary moment would be complete without an examination of the dominance of the small copyright sign on our lives.  In recent times, the aggressive expansion of property claims into every domain of knowledge and cultural practice has brought everyone from the academic to the musician into the debate.  In many ways, the mere act of looking at, reading, listening to, creating, understanding, or communicating any objects that embody thought, knowledge or feeling is as fraught with anxiety today as the trespassing of private property has been throughout much of human history.{{focref|2}}

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:fossopenpopealien.jpg|600px]]
|}
(Source: http://www.popealien.com)

This anxiety and conflict is not restricted to a set of geographical locations; however, the nature of the conflict changes as we move from the United States and Europe to parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa. In the US, the crisis is represented as a crisis of creativity; the
dominant fear is that of the shrinking of the '''public domain''' and the '''commons'''{{focref|3}}by the extension of copyright, the challenges brought about by new technologies of production and dissemination, such as the Internet, and the criminalization of '''peer-to-peer (P2P)''' activities of young people. In Africa, the price of learning materials imposes a heavy cost to governments already plagued by other pressing developmental needs.Meanwhile, in many parts of Asia, the proliferation of cheap media reproduction technologies creates a parallel economy that
threatens the monopoly once held by dominant media industry players and places these
countries at risk of facing sanctions from the US for violating copyrights.{{focref|4}}

Lest we imagine that this is a completely new situation, let us revisit a moment in history which
was rather similar. The 18th Century saw a transition from a largely agrarian to an industrial
economy. This change was accompanied by massive transformations in the realm of property
law, marked by sharp social conflict and the emergence of all kinds of laws to protect
property and regulate everyday life. A new language of criminality emerged alongside new
forms of property protection and a sharp increase in the use of force against offenders
(ranging from people who ‘stole fruits from trees’ to people who illegally occupied land).{{focref|5}}

We are constantly reminded that we are in an era of transition, and it is clear through current
discourse that we are now living in an information era.{{focref|6}} This transition has been marked by the attempts to define new regimes of property, giving rise to sharp social conflicts over the definitions and extent of such property.

In the midst of the aggressive expansion of ‘intellectual property’,{{focref|7}} there has also been a parallel movement arguing for a re-articulation of the importance of the commons of
knowledge and cultural production. Thus, even as systems of copyright, patent and trademark
attempt to entrench themselves alongside the older structures of capitalism by creating a new
language of criminality,{{focref|8}} there is another language that has been emerging – the language of ‘openness’, ‘collaborative production’ and ‘freedom’ with respect to information goods, cultural production and participation in the information economy.This new language has been enabled by the success of the Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) movement, with its
most-identified product, the GNU/Linux operating system, being evoked as a viable alternative
to the world of classical copyright and proprietary knowledge.{{focref|9}}

==What is Open Content?==
In this e-Primer,we shall be looking specifically at the world of Open Content,by which we mean
all material (text, sound, images) that the general public can freely use, distribute and
modify without the traditional restrictions imposed by copyright. These actions can be
sanctioned either by an Open Content '''license''' or by commonly accepted practice.{{focref|10}}

Open Content derives philosophically from the Free Software movement and attempts to
achieve for the world of general content what FOSS did for software.{{focref|11}} The word ‘content’ itself may sometimes be misleading as it refers to a whole range of subject matter, from music to movies and literature to learning materials. We therefore use the phrase ‘Open Content’ to primarily refer to content that provides the greatest freedom (the right to modify), since other kinds of content which do not provide the right to modify may actually be covered by the Open Access movement. Finally, for the purposes of this e-Primer, we shall use the word ‘content’ to include the range of materials covered by copyright law, excluding software.

==Overview of the e-Primer==
In this e-Primer,we begin by examining the context in which the Open Content movement has
emerged; namely, the politics of copyright and the ways in which it impedes creativity and the
sharing of knowledge.We also examine some of the founding myths that inform copyright law.
We then move on to an analysis of how copyright has developed over the past decades and
what that means for questions of access to knowledge and culture.

The next section then examines alternatives to copyright that have emerged in the context of
software and their application to the domain of knowledge creation.This leads us to a detailed
examination of the ways in which the Open Content paradigm is reshaping our ideas of
creativity and knowledge creation using various case studies. This is followed by a study of the
ways in which Open Content licenses work. Finally, we conclude with an analysis of the
potential policy implications and possible limitations of Open Content.</text>

7 A number of activists and scholars have argued that we need to avoid using the phrase &quot;intellectual property&quot; since it conceals more than it reveals.  The phrase includes a range of property claims from trademarks, copyright, patents, geographical indications, etc., all of which belong to distinct domains, and that there is nothing that brings them together.  We acknowledge this to be a serious question, and use the phrase in reference to its global usage, albeit with a certain degree of agnosticism.

{{TextBox|''Originality is nothing but judicious imitation. The most original writers borrowed one from another. The instruction we find in books is like fire.We fetch it from our neighbours, kindle it at home, communicate it to others, and it becomes the property of all.''

Voltaire}}

If Open Content, like its predecessor the Free Software movement, attempts to create a
practice which is radically different from the way the copyright imagines our relationship to
knowledge and culture, then the first question that needs to be addressed is: what exactly is
the problem with copyright. Mainstream logic and popular discourse seem to suggest that
copyright is a system that was created for the benefit of content creators, so why would
content creators want to consider any other option at all? It is important to look at the myths
that copyright generates for itself in a critical fashion, and examine whether these myths have
any basis in reality.

==The Myths of Copyright==
Copyright has a rather straightforward justification for itself. We shall begin with what may
be considered a rather typical account of the necessity of copyright law.Copyright is the branch
of intellectual property law that protects original works of authorship. These include
literary, artistic, musical and dramatic works as well as software. In recent years, copyright law
has included protection for performers’ rights. The key assumption that sustains copyright law
is that authors have a natural right over their works of intellectual labour12 and that copyright
protection is required to provide an incentive to create intellectual works. Copyright therefore
grants an exclusive right to authors over their works, including the right to authorize
reproduction, adaptation, performance, distribution, etc.{{focref|13}}

It is alleged that in the absence of a copyright system, there would be no incentive for authors
to produce and, consequently, there would be a general decline in the world of creativity and
the arts. Hence, copyright inherently includes a balance between the protection of authors on
the one hand and the interest of the public on the other. It is recognized that excessive
protection may result in curbing public access to works; therefore, copyright protects only
unique expressions and not ideas per se. It is argued that copyright seeks to achieve a balance
between public access and creator rights by providing the creator of the work a period of time
during which s/he shall have the exclusive rights to the work.As such, any person who uses the
work of another person is indulging in an act of stealing the other person’s ideas, resulting in
substantial losses for the author of the work.This is the underlying ‘myth of copyright’.

{{TextBox|Hans Christian Andersen was once accused by the wife of another Danish writer of
lifting material verbatim from other authors for a play he was writing.“You have copied
whole paragraphs word for word from Oehlenschläger and lngemann!” she challenged.
“I know,”Andersen replied with a guilty grin. ”Aren't they splendid [sic]?”}}

The myth of copyright seems to have intrinsic appeal, relying as it does on a battle for progress
(copyright promotes creativity) against a potentially dystopic world (there will be no creativity
without copyright). The reason why we choose to use the phrase ‘the myth of
copyright’ is because we recognize the wonderful success of copyright in narrating itself as a universal truth. The history of copyright is always narrated in an ahistorical manner following a
universally teleological route as though it were the natural culmination of events.

Yet there seem to be gaps in this story; it is neither complete nor accurate without locating the
real-world operation of copyright.While copyright’s initial purpose may have been to provide
an incentive for creators, it is important not to be taken in completely by this mythical claim.
Consider, for instance, the following:
*Most creators/authors are rarely the owners of their own copyright. It usually gets
transferred to either the recording company, the publisher, or the person commissioning a
work of art, etc.{{focref|14}}
*Musicians often make most of their money from live performances rather than from
‘royalties’ from sales of their records. They sell ‘services’, as do many programmers and
designers.
*Monetary incentive is rarely the only reason for a person to be engaged in cultural
production. Furthermore, an Open Content model does not preclude the creator from
making money off his/her work.{{focref|15}}

Copyright may have begun as a system of balances to provide incentives to creators while also
ensuring that there was a free circulation of works in the public domain, which all other
creators could build upon. For example, copyright explicitly allowed (and still allows) public
libraries to exist as an alternative, non-commercial distribution channel for cultural works.Over
time, this balance has shifted drastically in favour of content owners such as large publishing
houses, media conglomerates, etc. In the contemporary context, it is arguable that copyright is
often used as a tool to prevent or curb creativity and that the move away from copyright is an
important one in that it seeks to refocus on the interest of the general public as well as artists
and creators.

Let us now have a closer look at some of the sustaining myths of copyright and examine their
validity as universal truths.

==The Myth of the Solitary Genius as Author==
At the heart of copyright is the figure of the Author and his/her rights.As simple as it may sound,
this assertion is important to our understanding of copyright, for at the heart of the statement
lies the presumption that everyone has a clear understanding of authorship.
For instance, ask any person to rattle of the names of the great authors, and you will find a
varied crowd ranging from Shakespeare, Chaucer, Kalidas and Valmiki to Salman Rushdie and
perhaps Jeffrey Archer. In this chapter we shall examine some of the scholarship on the
history of the discourse of authorship which suggest that the idea of the author may have a
more complex history than merely a reference to the individual named as an author.

There are then two sets of self-fulfilling prophesies that are achieved by the assertion that
copyright protects the rights of authors. It assumes a category which makes universal sense
across cultures and across time – namely that of the author – and, having erected this
universal figure of the author and asserting that copyright is meant for his/her protection, it
universalizes the relationship between copyright and creativity. Our first task is then to
historicize the emergence of the author as a relatively modern phenomenon that has arisen
in the context of the crisis caused by the print revolution.{{focref|16}}

Before the invention of the printing press, the act of writing was a very localized activity. It was
impossible to disseminate knowledge in any significant manner since the inaccuracies of
copying prevented any widespread use of the written work.The invention of the printing press
thus enabled a number of innovations. Duplication became easier and more accurate. Mass
distribution became viable.The printing press revolutionized information storage, retrieval and
usage. Printing, unlike writing, allowed a society to build on the past with a confidence that
each step was being made on a firm foundation. The revolution in the ability to
accurately reproduce works fostered an understanding that progress can occur through a
process of revision and improvement. Additionally, access was now available to the literate
public. Printing provided a mechanism by which a larger reading public developed, thus
constituting the emerging public sphere.

This new reading public that emerged demanded books – both original works and
reprints – and set the stage for the impending conflict over the ownership of such information.
As Mark Rose observes, “a sufficient market for books to sustain a commercial system of
cultural production”had to exist before a formal regime of intellectual property could come into
being. What was earlier the monopoly of the Stationers Company, a guild recognized and
regulated by the Crown, became a mass industrial activity with a number of publishers in the
provinces (Scotland) publishing cheap reprints for the new reading public.

|'''Etymology''': (c.1330) from Old French copie, from Medieval Latin copia, ”reproduction,
transcript,” from L. copia “plenty, means” (see “copious”).
The word ‘copy’ moves in English from an original sense of “abundance” to the more
recent sense of derivativeness; it passes thereby from a sense of plenty (“Spain bath
grete copie and plente of castefl,” Trevisa 1387; “the copie and varietie of our
sweete-mother-toong,”Florio 1598) to an emphasis on the scarcity and rarity of originals.{{focref|17}}
|}

The reaction from the literary and artistic world was to move away from the ‘ills of industrial
revolution’; thus, they began deploying the notion of the author as a unique and transcendent
being, possessing originality of spirit. The romantic artist was therefore deemed to have a sort
of intangible property, wholly contained within the self – the author’s original, creative works.
This romantic theory of authorship has since remained the dominant account of the process of
creativity.{{focref|18}}

{{TextBox|Before the publication, the author has an undeniable and unlimited right.Think of a man like
Dante, Molière or Shakespeare. Imagine him at the time when he has just finished a great
work.His manuscript is there, in front of him; suppose that he gets the idea to throw it into the
fire; nobody can stop him. Shakespeare can destroy Hamlet, Molière Tartuffe,Dante the Hell.
But as soon as the work is published, the author is not any more the master. It is then that
other persons seize it; call them what you will: human spirit, public domain, society.

Victor Hugo, 1870}}

Thus, there is an inextricable link between copyright and the concept of an author.
The proprietary author emerges as the London publisher’s mode of maintaining strict control
over copyright. However, once unleashed, the idea of the author starts taking on a new
meaning with unexpected consequences. It emerges as a new social relationship, which will
transform the way society perceives the ownership of knowledge. This establishment of the
ideological figure of the author naturalizes a particular process of knowledge production
where the emphasis on individual contribution denigrates the concept of community
knowledge and helps promulgate the notion of the individual as owner.

However,we have to ask the question of whether any act of creation happens in a vacuum, with
the author creating something out of nothing. Common sense informs us that even the
magician who seems to pull a rabbit out of an empty hat is engaging in a sleight of hand.

{{TextBox|'''Creativity and the Public Domain'''

The Walt Disney Corporation founded much of its wealth on folk tales, such as Snow
White and Sinbad, by taking them out of the public domain and turning them into
proprietary, copyrighted films and merchandise products.Today, the company is one of
the strongest backers and political lobby sponsors for drastic copyright restrictions on
digital media. The same is true for many works considered part of the high-cultural
canon, crafted by unidentified, often collective authors: Homer’s epics for example, or
the Tales of 1001 Nights which were spread by storytellers and of which no authoritative,
‘original’ written version ever existed. Modern philology believes them to be derived
from Persian sources which in return were translated from Indian works.

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, original authorship was rather more disregarded
than encouraged. In the foreword to Don Quixote,Cervantes falsely claims that his novel
was based on an Arabic source. Literary works typically render themselves canonical not
by inventing new stories, but by rewriting existing ones, such as the many adaptations
of Faustus from Christopher Marlowe to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Fernando Pessoa,
Alfred Jarry,Thomas Mann and Michel Butor.

Until the 20th Century and the rise of the recording industry, copyright played no major
role in music and musical composition.Musical themes were freely adapted and copied
from one composer to another. Bach’s Concerto in D Major BWV 972, for example, is
simply a re-orchestration of the ninth movement of Vivaldi’s L’Estro Armonica. And of
course, the entire genre of Blues music is, as a matter of fact, a variation of only one song,
the twelve-bar harmonic scheme.

In nêhiyawin (Cree cosmology) to refer to something as ‘mine’does not necessarily imply
ownership, but refers instead to a relational proximity to objects (animate and
inanimate) and beings and the accompanying responsibilities and obligations.}}

A number of the Open Content projects such as Wikipedia base themselves on an alternative
model of production, one in which the individual myth of creation is contested and negated.
But it would be important for us to remember that this is not a new phenomenon; over
centuries, a number of cultures have grown and spread on the basis of collaborative production.

{{TextBox|'''The Story Teller of Peshawar'''

The chattering comes to an intuitive halt; the room becomes motionless and an eerie
silence envelops the air. Khan Baba steps in, unaided even in his old age, he is the
embodiment of a proud Pathan. A pristine white beard flows from a face, wrinkled
through age and physical hardship; his eyes though are a testament to his blazing
spirit. A word is yet to be spoken; Khan Baba instead relies on his eyes to relay warmth.
The bustling market seems to have sensed the occasion, the buses and the rickshaws
seem no longer to be there. Khan Baba finally greets his audience, orders some tea and
gets into an inane conversation with those around him; a veteran of the art, he teases
the anxious audience. Finally he begins; it is going to be a story of passion and love,war
and death, with a smile he adds ‘about all the good things in life’.

This is the story of a story teller, Khan Baba, who belongs to a dying breed of men,
anxious to hold on to the last remnants of their heritage…storytelling. They ply their
trade in the Qissa-Kahani Bazaar, in Peshawar, Pakistan. It is in Peshawar that traders and
travellers, men of science and men of war, travelling through the Khyber Pass and the
Silk Route have stopped and relayed their stories for hundreds of years in tea
shops dotted around the Bazaar. These tea shops are a relic to a bygone era, but even
today they serve as an ancient repository of stories and memoirs.

For Khan Baba, a story can never simply be read; it must be listened to and then passed
on through the generations. When it comes to these stories, there is no concept of
ownership or of uniqueness; there is however a concept of sharing one’s experiences
and of imparting knowledge; for these stories are considered to be the collective
wisdom of the Pathans. The story tellers consider themselves to be guardians of an
ancient tradition, and by recalling the stories of their lives, and the lives of their
forefathers, they keep their history alive.

{{TextBox|'''Dreamtime'''

Many different cultures and civilisations strongly believe that knowledge is something
to be shared amongst all people and should not be confined to those who can afford to
gain knowledge. The Australian Aborigines, for example, have no Western concept of
originality. In aboriginal culture, art is not defined by originality, no matter how distinct
it may be, but by the correct representation of ancestral traditions, known as ‘the
Dreaming’. The stories which constitute the Dreaming carry the truth from the past
together with the Code of Law, which operates in the present.The Dreaming consists of
the natural world, especially the land or county to which a person belongs, and hence it
is the person who belongs to the Dreaming and not the Dreaming to the person. In our
ceremonies we wear marks on our bodies, they come from the Dreaming too, we carry
the design that the Dreamings gave to us. When we wear that Dreaming mark we are
carrying the country,we are keeping the Dreaming held up,we are keeping the country and
the Dreaming alive.

===Copyright and the Incentive for Creativity ===
One of the main justifications for copyright law is that in the absence of copyright, authors of
works would lack the incentive to further create; that artists cannot produce new works
without economic incentive. Copyright is justified on the basis that it stimulates investment of
time and money in the creation of new works, and that many authors of copyrighted works rely
on the income derived from their publication for their livelihood.

{{TextBox|Nothing can be made of nothing; he who has laid up no materials can produce no
combinations.

Sir Joshua Reynolds, English portrait painter}}

There may even be a case for the proposition that without incentives, authors would find it
difficult to create new works; however, the statement that copyright law is the basis for this
incentive requires a closer examination. Is copyright synonymous with incentives or does
copyright merely create an illusory idea that it is the best system to foster creativity?

Firstly, many authors who have little hope of ever finding a market for their publications and
whose copyrights are, as a result, virtually worthless, have in the past, and at present, continued
to write, create and invent. While it may not be a general phenomenon, it is possible that
people produce works for pure personal satisfaction, or even for peer respect and recognition.

Secondly, historically, there is much evidence to suggest that copyright law and incentive were
rarely linked. The 19th Century, for instance, saw the proliferation of literary works, despite the
absence of any meaningful protection afforded to authors by virtue of their copyright.While
copyright protection existed, these rarely benefited the author beyond an initial payment for
the copyrights in their works. This payment, often referred to as an honorarium, bore no
relationship to the exchange value of that work; rather, it was merely an acknowledgment of the
writer’s achievements. In the vast majority of cases, most profits went to the publisher and, on
occasion, authors were even asked to underwrite a portion of the publishing costs. Moreover,
without the publisher, the copyright in effect had no value, as the work could never be
published.Hence, copyright protection in reality benefited the publisher, but rarely the author.{{focref|19}}

With the enactment of every subsequent Copyright Act, the protection given to authors was
reduced. In England, prior to 1814, copyright of a work reverted to the author after a term.
The author could then renew proprietary rights in a work and could conceivably gain from
again transferring the copyright. However, after 1814, such renewal terms were eliminated and
the author lost his/her position in the mechanisms of copyright. The typical transaction
consisted of the transfer of the copyright to the publisher by the author for a one-time
payment. Subsequent to that, the author had little role to play in the publication of a work, and
the author reaped little reward. {{focref|20}}

This can be seen in a number of recent cases regarding the translation of works into new media.
At issue in these cases is whether the author, who has transferred copyright in, say, a film, to
another party, has a proprietary interest in translations of this work into new media, say release
over the Internet, the development of which was unforeseen at the time of copyright transfer.
In the United States, there are a number of cases where it has been held that the author no
longer has a proprietary interest in works that have been translated into new media. In such
cases, where does copyright provide an incentive to authors?{{focref|21}}

In addition, the existence of alternative incentives further erodes the incentive claim of
copyright protection. Two non-monetary incentives have been identified above: personal
satisfaction and recognition. Many people have created works without thought of monetary
benefit. It is doubted that Anne Frank wrote her diary or Nehru his letters with the intent to eke
the benefits arising out of copyright protection.

Furthermore, advancement and honour in one’s field and recognition are other forms of
compensation for authorship. As in the term ‘honorarium’, discussed above, there is great
prestige in composing an acclaimed book, article or piece of art.These incentives will always be
present, regardless of whether one is awarded monopoly rights.

Original authors may also have the benefit of being the first movers in the market. By entering
the market first, the authors of works may be able to capture a certain degree of the
economic rewards that copyright aims to bestow even without the actual conferral of such legal
rights.

Currently, there exist several mechanisms – primarily Internet based – for creating incentives
that stand independent from copyright. The Street Performer, or the Fairshare Protocols are
examples of such devices. Under the first method, the authors contemplate a menu of options
available to artists. Under the latter system, several people make a payment directly to the
author to finance future works, with the understanding that they are given access to a portion
of the consequent profits.What each have in common is that a release price will be set for a
work, and that it will be made available in digital form without (or with few) copyright
restrictions, once members of the public voluntarily donate sufficient funds to meet the
asking price. An author might set up a website and announce a book project directly to the
public. Usually, though not necessarily, the author might begin by posting a chapter or two to
give readers a sample of what is to come.{{focref|22}}

===Copyright Protects the Poor Struggling Author===
We are constantly regaled with stories of how the copyright system acts as the basic
protection for poor struggling authors who would otherwise be unable to protect themselves
against piracy or knowledge theft. Let us clarify at the very outset that we are not the enemies
of creative workers, and we would of course like to see all creative labour recognized and
rewarded.Take, for instance, the following account from American cartoon creator Bill Waterson
of how the system works for unknown artists and creators.

{{TextBox|''My attitude toward the strip's production also put me in a strange position when the
pressure built to license Calvin and Hobbes.On the one hand, it provided a simple clarity in
the decision to forgo all merchandising. I didn't think greeting cards,T-shirts, or plush dolls fit
with the spirit or message of my comic strip, and I didn't like the idea of using this hard-won,
precious job to peddle a bunch of trinkets. I wanted to draw cartoons, not run an empire, so
the offers and requests were not tempting in the slightest. On the other hand, none of my
reasons for declining involved business considerations, so these arguments were not
particularly persuasive to my syndicate, which flat-out owned the rights to my work and
stood to split the immense wealth these products likely would have generated.

Over the years, I've come to realize that it's almost impossible to make anyone understand
why, five years into the culmination of my life's dreams, I was ready to quit the strip and lose
everything, rather than get appallingly rich off Calvin and Hobbes products. All I can say is,
I worked too long to get this job, and worked too hard once I got it, to let other people run
away with my creation once it became successful. If I could not control what my own work
was about and stood for, then cartooning meant very little to me.

In hindsight I see that, with so much money at stake, the artistic issues I argued about were
irrelevant. In the end, it was simply might makes right. I was an unknown cartoonist when
I started, and my contractual disadvantage reflected my nonexistent bargaining power
when I got the job.Five years later, I was a big enough gorilla that I could turn the tables.Even
though I finally got my way, the whole mess is depressing to recall, even all these years later.
The fight was personally traumatic. For several years it poisoned what had been a happy
relationship with my syndicate, and in my disillusionment and disgust at being pushed to the
wall, I lost the conviction that I wanted to spend my life cartooning. Both sides paid a heavy
price for this battle.''
Bill Waterson,Creator of Calvin and Hobbes (Introduction to Collected ''Calvin and Hobbes'')}}

It was perhaps his rather unpleasant experience with the formal system of intellectual
property that prompts Bill Waterson to make critical references to it in his comics.

The metaphor of the poor struggling author tends to blur the critical difference between the
authorship of a work and the ownership of the same.While there is a tendency in copyright law
to invoke liberal individualism to justify economic structures that frustrate the aspirations of real-life individuals, it is somewhat surprising to encounter the individualistic romantic
conception of ’authorship’ deployed to support a regime that disassociates creative workers
from a legal interest in their creations. Take, for instance, the ’work-for-hire’ doctrine of
copyright law. This doctrine states that the firm or individual who paid to have a work created,
rather than the person who created it, is regarded as the ‘author’ for purposes of copyright
ownership. Thus, works of copyright conflict are, in fact, often created by unromantic authors
sitting in their cubicles creating for large corporations.{{focref|23}}

When a work is deemed to have been made ‘for hire’, the alienation of labour is formally and
legally complete: the ‘author’ of the ‘work’ is the person on whose behalf the ‘work’ was
created, not the individual who created it. In this legal configuration, the employer's rights do
not derive from the employee by an implied grant or assignment. Rather, those rights are the
direct result of the employer's status. Ironically, the employer’s claims are rationalized in terms
of the romantic conception of ‘authorship’ with its concomitant values of ‘originality’ and
‘inspiration’. {{focref|24}}

Secondly, if one were to closely analyse the publishing agreements of various publishing
houses,one would notice immediately that unless you are an author of some fame,contracts are
absolutely one-sided, with the individual author having little bargaining power, as s/he assigns
all rights in favour of the publishing house.

Piracy has always been portrayed as being an assault on the rights of authors. It is interesting to
note, for instance, that during the initial days of one of India’s largest music companies,
T Series, the company was often approached by various small-time singers requesting them to
release their works through the pirated circuit because HMV, the owners of the work’s
copyright, were unable or uninterested in issuing the works, and the authors therefore did not
have a chance to ensure that the works were available to the consuming public. {{focref|25}}

The example of Harry Potter series author J K Rowling as a struggling single mother is often
used as an example of copyright protecting the rights of poor authors. However, now that
Ms. Rowling has become one of the highest-paid authors in the world and has enjoyed great
publishing success, the poor author metaphor would not seem to apply.Clearly, pirates respond
only to market demand, and not every book, film, CD or other form of intellectual property is
pirated. There is a particular popularity or price limit that is required to be achieved before a
work enters into the piracy circuit. Presumably then, if a work has achieved enough status to
become pirated (as in the case of the Harry Potter books), the poor struggling author has
already struck rich.Thus, the sight of Madonna appearing in TV ads condemning piracy because
it deprives her of livelihood is not quite convincing when images of her many villas and islands
flash in your mind.{{focref|26}}

==Expansion of Copyright Over the Years==
Even assuming that copyright began its career as a system of balance between owners of
copyright and the public interest, this system has grossly shifted in favour of owners and at the
costs of the public.

There are three ways to account for the expansion of copyright. These are through the term of
copyright, the reach of copyright and the scope of copyright.When copyright began in 1709
with the Statute of Anne, it was for a limited term of 14 years.Over the years, however, there has
been a gradual expansion of the term of copyright, primarily pushed by the entertainment
industry.Much has been written about the ‘mouse that ate up the public domain’, or the story of
how Disney corporation has been one of the major actors in pushing for an extension of the
term of copyright.{{focref|27}} If this artificial lease on life had not been constantly granted to copyright,
Mickey Mouse would have – or rather should have – been in the public domain by now.

Writing about the extension of copyright term in the United States, Lawrence Lessig says that:

{{TextBox|In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of copyright was changed once. In 1831, the term was increased from a maximum of 28 years to a maximum of 42 by increasing the initial
term of copyright from 14 years to 28 years. In the next 50 years of the Republic, the term
increased once again. In 1909, Congress extended the renewal term of 14 years to 28 years,
setting a maximum term of 56 years. Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that
has defined copyright law since. Eleven times in the last 40 years, Congress has extended the
terms of existing copyrights; twice in those 40 years, Congress extended the term of future
copyrights. Initially, the extensions of existing copyrights were short, a mere one to two years. In 1976, Congress extended all existing copyrights by 19 years. And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Congress extended the term of existing and future copyrights by 20 years. The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the passing of works into the public domain. This latest extension means that the public domain will have been tolled for 39 out of 55 years, or 70 percent of the time since 1962. Thus, in the 20 years after the Sonny Bono Act, while one million patents will pass into the public domain, zero copyrights will pass into the public domain by virtue of the expiration of a copyright term.{{focref|28}}}}

The latest extension was challenged by Lawrence Lessig and others in Eldred v.Ashcroft,{{focref|29}} where
Lessig took a constitutional argument to say that the extension term violated both the
copyright clause of the US Constitution as well as the first amendment. The Supreme
Court upheld the validity of the extension.While the case was an exciting attempt at linking
copyright to the oldest public law tradition, namely constitutional doctrines, it also seriously
reveals the limitation of the constitutional argument when it comes to questioning property.

The second area of expansion of copyright has been in terms of the reach of copyright.Where
copyright was initially supposed to be for the protection of ‘original’works of authorship, since
the idea of originality in copyright is a very minimal one, it has allowed for all kinds of works to
be brought under the umbrella of a copyright claim. It is ironic that the same doctrine of
copyright and authorship is used to protect the works of a single author as much as that of a
large corporation employing thousands of coders to prepare software. The question of
databases, for example, is an area of contention in copyright law, where mere collection of facts
have sought protection on the basis of being original works of authorship, the argument being
that originality requires proving a minimum standard of originality, or, as long as it can be shown
that there was a slight element of originality combined with investment and labour, then it
would fall under the protection of copyright law.{{focref|30}}

Finally, and most troubling, has been the scope of copyright. When copyright began, it was
primarily concerned with a single right, namely the right to reproduce or the right to make
copies. But with the emergence of new technologies and new media, the cultural commodity
has now become – via the control of derivative rights – an endless commodity of signification
as well as of property.

{{TextBox|Lead the people with governmental measures and regulate them by law and punishments,
and they will avoid wrongdoing, but will have no sense of honour and shame. Lead them by
virtue and regulate them by the rules of propriety and they will have a sense of shame and,
moreover, set themselves right.

Confucius, The Analects, 2:3

After completing his Analects, Confucius was remarked as having said “I have
completed the work of my life and I am happy to say that not a single thought here is
mine.” The great sage of the 6th Century BC is also recorded as saying: “I transmit
rather than create.”According to William P Alford, author of To Steal a Book is an Elegant
Offence, the attitudes enshrined in these aphorisms had a determining effect on the
Chinese attitude to intellectual property. Until the country opened itself to Western
influence in the early 20th Century, its intellectual property system was effectively
self-regulating, relying on the principles of respect and tradition.{{focref|31}} }}

== How Copyright Impedes Creativity and Access to Knowledge==

It is a combination of all three aspects; the term, the reach and the scope of copyright which
imposes a heavy cost on the ability of people to access knowledge and culture.While this is not
limited to only developing countries, the impact on them is greater.We can look at the impact
of copyright on questions of creativity and access to knowledge in two ways: one is by looking
at access barriers set up by copyright as a result of the price of information, and the second is
by looking at the ways in which creativity and social practices are curtailed through copyright law.

It is important to locate the debate on copyright within the larger political economy of the
knowledge and culture industries. The core copyright industries are serious business: the top
three exports of the US, for instance, are movies, music and software. In 2001, the value of the
copyright industries stood at $535 billion and exports from the same accounted for $88 billion
to $97 billion. By comparison, chemicals exports were valued at $74.6 billion and automobiles
at $56.52 billion.{{focref|32}} It is only within this context of the global political economy of the media
industry that we can even begin to understand the ramifications of licensing in copyright law.
The contemporary media empire is one of convergence and of cross-holdings; the classical
distinctions between types of media no longer apply. It is precisely this world of the
disaggregated media commodity in which the control over derivate rights through licensing
becomes a critical component of the way through which media empires are imagined.{{focref|33}}It is the
disaggregated media commodity that can be controlled through time and space, which is
critical in maintaining large media empires that span the globe.

The developed nations, led by the United States, remain the main producers and consumers of
cultural goods. From the 1990s, the export value of US copyrighted products (which include
books, but are mainly entertainment commodities such as films, music and television
programmes), exceeded the total for clothing, chemicals, cars, computers and airplanes
combined.{{focref|34}} In 1997, the value of copyrighted products was $414 billion, according to one
popular account.The core copyright industries extend to “all industries that create copyright or
related works as their primary product: advertising, computer software, design, photography,
film, video, performing arts, music (publishing, recording and performing), publishing, radio and
TV, and video games.”This list does not even begin to cover the economic value of patents and
trademarks, which is considerable.{{focref|35}}

Ironically, it could be argued that it is precisely the highly hierarchical structure of global media
that enables the increased importance of alternative paradigms such as Open Content, peer
production, etc. New technologies and tools have provided the context through which
effective voluntary individual action can be enabled, and these technologies allow for various
decentralized production practices, which challenge the market monopoly.

Given that developing nations remain as net importers of proprietary and copyright material,
one then has to look at the amount that developing nations end up paying in the form of
royalties to developed countries, and the difference it would make if the same money was used
for other areas of concern, such as health, education and infrastructure.

The often prohibitive cost of educational materials inhibits educational opportunities, hence
the need to ensure that educational materials remain affordable. Educational materials that are
protected by copyright are not always affordable. The possibility of assigning and licensing
copyright has enabled the sustenance of various industries, such as the book publishing
industry and the music publishing industry. These copyright-enabled industries determine the
price and the availability of copyrighted materials. As a result, vast amounts of educational
materials have been priced at a level that is beyond the reach of consumers in developing
countries. This constitutes a barrier to access to knowledge, hence a denial of the right to
education.{{focref|37}}

The Consumer International (CI) report,“Copyright and Access to Knowledge”, argues that:

{{TextBox|Evidence gathered by CI in this project indicates that copyrighted educational materials are
indeed prohibitively priced in developing countries and in that manner pose a barrier to access
to knowledge. This is evident from the results of a comparative price survey of book prices.
Although the retail prices of books in developing countries are generally lower in absolute terms,
when the prices are considered in the context of a country’s GDP per capita, it becomes clear that
consumers in developing countries are in fact paying more than consumers in developed
countries for the same books.{{focref|38}} }}

In many cases, the books that are being used in primary schools, in legal education, in
engineering and in medicine are textbooks which are imported from the UK or the US. In the
absence of an indigenous textbook publishing sector, most of these books have to be
imported, and they are rarely subsidized. Even in the few cases when textbooks come at a
subsidized rate, their prices are still astronomical. Take, for instance, the results of the study by
CI, which looked at the comparative costs of textbooks in Thailand, Indonesia and in the US, as
shown in Table 1.

A comparative price study was conducted to illustrate the relatively high cost of educational
materials in developing countries in gross domestic product (GDP) terms. The study compares
the prices of five university textbooks in Indonesia, Thailand and the US. In absolute terms, the
retail prices of textbooks in Indonesia and Thailand are generally lower than the list prices of the
same books in the US. This may be due to the commendable practice of major textbook
publishers publishing international or student editions for distribution in developing
countries like Indonesia and Thailand.

The report goes on to state that:

{{TextBox|Nevertheless, lower prices of textbooks do not translate to more affordable books.When the price
of a book is considered in the context of a country’s GDP per capita (i.e. the average
individual income), it becomes apparent that these books remain prohibitively expensive to the
average Indonesian and Thai.When a student in Indonesia is made to pay US$81.70 for an older
edition of Goodman &amp; Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, it is equivalent to a
student in the US paying US$3,170.97 for the same book.Even when a comparison is made using
the GDP per capita calculated at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate, so that the
standard of living in different countries is taken into account, the prices are still prohibitive.Using
the same book as an example, when a student in Indonesia is made to pay US$81.70 for the
book, it is equivalent to a student in the US paying US$913.07 for the same book.{{focref|39}}}}

With the increasing move of having electronic databases for scientific as well as social science
journals, the situation is no better. While one would have imagined that enabling electronic
resources would increase access to these materials, this is far from the case. In most cases, these
databases are owned by very large publishing houses, and access to these databases is at
exorbitant prices and usually restricted to large institutions and universities. In most
universities in developing nations, where the library budget is often dismal, it becomes
impossible to have access to any of these databases, thereby perpetuating the
knowledge/information gap that exists.

Scholarly communication or access to the entire scientific record has always relied on a
global network of libraries sharing the burden of acquisition of the estimated 70,000 or
so academic journals that are published around the world. Academic libraries share these
resources primarily through a system of inter-library loans. If a researcher requires an article
from a journal that is not in Library A’s collections, staff members contact Library B, which does
subscribe, and get a photocopy of the article, which the researcher can keep. This is
frequently done free of charge as there is a principle of reciprocity at work, but in theory, the
researcher may have to cover the copying costs.{{focref|40}}

Journal publishers typically charge higher subscription rates to libraries than to individuals,
precisely in order to recover what they see as lost sales from this kind of activity, which is, of
course, perfectly legal under fair-use exemptions. However, with the advent of multi-layered
protection of digital content, libraries that subscribe to electronic journals through access to a
database sometimes find that they are forbidden by the terms of the contract from sharing
electronic or paper copies of articles with other institutions. The researcher then has no other
resort than desist, or to turn to a commercial document delivery service to obtain a copy,
perhaps at a transaction cost of $8 or more. This is an active disincentive to enquiry, especially
in poor countries, where research funds are spread thin and $8 represents a significant cost.

At another level, if the system of intellectual property protection effectively closes off parts of
the scientific record, not through censorship or formal barriers, but by making access
unaffordable, it can be argued that the requirement of full disclosure is not being met.{{focref|41}}

One of the most significant initiatives in recent times has been the US-based Massachusetts
Institute of Technology’s Open CourseWare (MIT OCW) initiative, which makes world-class
learning materials available for free download and use. It has been reported that the largest
users of the materials have thus far been from countries in Africa and Latin America.42 Since the
site’s public launch on 30 September 2002, users from more than 215 countries, territories, and
city-states around the world have visited the MIT OCW. The site has received more than 25,000
email messages regarding its usefulness.

===The Impact of Copyright on Free Speech and Creativity===

The second important issue to examine is the impact of copyright on the process of creativity
itself. As we have argued, creativity is not a mythical process in which someone creates
something out of nothing, but is an incremental process where people may make use of
existing material, mix, match and develop something new. This is particularly true of the
digital era, where technologies have made it easier for people to produce music, films,
photographs, etc. However, if copyright imposes a cost by means of a licensing fee that has to
be paid for the use of pre-existing material, it might be increasingly more expensive to
produce content.{{focref|43}}

{{TextBox|Tarnation, the surprise hit at the 2004 Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals was made by
Jonathan Caouette, an unemployed New York actor and doorman. He made the film by
editing and combining his own home movies with other video clips and music.Caouette
spent $218 making the film and observed that “[m]aking a movie is not as difficult as it
is made out to be” and “[h]opefully this will be a catalyst for people who didn’t have a
voice before to go out and make a movie.”

After the film was declared a hit and people were interested in distributing it officially, it
was estimated that the total cost for making Tarnation will rise to over half a million
dollars to obtain rights to use copyrighted music and video clips.}}

Hip-hip artist Siva Vaidhyanathan brilliantly captures the way in which stricter copyright
depletes culture in his account of the music industry:

{{TextBox|In the early 1990s, I noticed [that rap] music was changing […] the underlying body of samples
were getting thinner, more predictable, more obvious, less playful. I had heard that there had
been some copyright conflicts in 1990 and 1991. So I suspected that lawsuits had chilled
playful and transgressive sampling. I was right. The courts had stolen the soul. And rap music is
poorer for it. We used to get fresh, exciting, walls of sound that were a language unto
themselves. By the mid-1990s, all we got were jeep beats and heavy bass.{{focref|44}}}}

A lot of contemporary creativity rests on the ability to borrow, appropriate and re-signify
existing works. This is an important aspect of creativity in a culture of mass media, where
everyone is fixed as a consumer, rather than a producer. {{focref|45}}

{{TextBox|In December 2003, a young artist, DJ Danger Mouse, remixed an album called the Grey
Album from the White Album of the Beatles and hip hop artist Jay Z’s Black Album. Only
3,000 copies of the Grey Album were released and would probably have disappeared
into obscurity were it not for the fact that two months later, DJ Danger Mouse received
a cease and desist letter ordering him to stop any further distribution of the album since
it violated the copyright of the Beatles’White Album, owned by EMI.

This unofficial ban on the album was seen as an unfair violation of creative expression
by a number of people, and a campaign called Grey Tuesday, sponsored by
http://www.downhillbattle.org, was launched to ensure that the album would still be
available for people to download via P2P networks. Over 170 websites offered to host
the Grey Album, many of which later received cease and desist letters from EMI.To date,
the Grey Album has been downloaded by over 1.25 million users and continues in
making DJ Danger Mouse one of the top ‘selling’ artists of 2004, beating other
contenders such as Norah Jones.

A lawyer/artist in India,Namita, created a parody of one of the largest Bollywood hits of
2004,Kal Ho Na Ho.The parody edited the original film in a way as to make it into a queer
love story, reversing the boy-girl story. This film has circulated massively in the queer
community and through P2P networks online. The film, unlike the original that it is
derived from, will never have a massive public release, but creatively uses the twin tools
of ‘copy’ and ‘paste’ from the original to make a subversive critique. And yet, given that
at the time of its making,fair use in India did not apply to films,its status is as an ‘illegal’work.}}

Moving beyond the level of the individual creator, the world’s largest film industry, India’s
Bollywood, has been known to a certain extent for its creative adaptation of Hollywood hits.
Some of these are done with religious rigor, ensuring that the copy tries to stay as close to the
original as possible, and yet in every instance of these acts of copying, there is necessarily an act
of rendering the text intelligible for the ‘Indian’ audience. This is a subject that has merited
serious ethnographic analysis in terms of what it is that makes a ‘cultural copy’. (For instance,
what are the conditions that are taken into mind while translating Seven Brides for Seven Brothers
into Satte pe Satta?) Very often, you have had Indian versions of the Hollywood film which have
been far better than the original (a case in point is Masoom, a remake of Man,Woman and Child).
In 2003, however, a very curious case was filed against an Indian TV serial, Karishma. The ‘grand
old lady of pulp’, Barbara Taylor Bradford, was informed by a ‘fan’ that people in India were
making a lavish remake of her novel AWoman of Substance. She flew to India and promptly filed
an injunction suit against the serial in an attempt to prevent its broadcast. But this begs the
question: what exactly was she attempting to protect, since the idea behind A Woman of Substance, namely, a woman’s rags-to-riches story, is an idea that cannot be protected under
copyright law? These processes of adaptations or copying are central to the process of cultural
production, and a quick survey of Hollywood history will itself reveal the number of ‘inspired’
films that they have made.{{focref|46}}

{{TextBox|Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is
necessary. Progress implies it. It embraces an author’s phrase, makes use of his expressions,
erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea.

Guy Debord, The Society of the Spectacle}}

===Copyright as a Threat to Free Speech===
{{TextBox|Alice Randall, a black American author, wrote a parody of Gone With the Wind from the
perspective of Scarlett O’Hara’s mullato half-sister. The estate of Gone With the Wind
author Margaret Mitchell claimed that this was an infringement of copyright and
obtained an injunction against the publication of the book. The court of appeal
overturned the injunction.

In 1998, the writer Kembrew McLeod, as a prank, successfully registered the phrase
‘freedom of expression’ with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, under Class
16 of the International Schedule. This covers printed matter. Writers are therefore no
longer free to use the expression without McLeod’s consent.{{focref|47}}}}

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been documenting various instances and cases of
how copyright is being used to silence dissenting speech acts. They range from scientists
withdrawing papers after being threatened with action under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act to members of fan fiction communities {{focref|48}} being asked to withdraw materials which the
copyright owners find offensive (http://www.chillingeffects.org).

While copyright claims are often made on the basis of property rights, because they deal
with the world of ideas and creativity, the line between property and censorship becomes
very blurred.

Where do we even begin to draw the line between culture and property in the contemporary,
where from the time that we wake up to the time that we go to sleep, we are engaging with
media forms/property of all kinds, from advertisements (‘the landscape of the modern’), to
music, to films, to the software we use, to the mobile phones that we carry. De Certeau said that
“[My] purpose…is to make explicit the systems of operational combination…which also
compose a ‘culture’, and to bring to light the models of action characteristic of users whose
status as the dominated element in society…is concealed by the euphemistic term
‘consumers’. Everyday life invents itself by poaching in countless ways on the property of
others.”{{focref|49}}
