      <text xml:space="preserve">The sample gui application quits immediately now ... I need to put a (. Thread (sleep 10000)) to get any value from it.  Brand new to Clojure, so I'm not sure what the best fix is.

== split into multiple pages? ==

Good article, but long.  Might consider splitting it into multiple pages.

-- I split the main topic to subpages, but didn't edit the main page yet. This should help further work

=== mvn vs ant ===

I've did &quot;mvn install&quot;, but it downloaded a whole bunch of things to my machine. And so far just doing &quot;ant&quot; works for me :)

== Problem with clj-completions script ==

The supplied clj-competions script doesn't work with recent svn checkouts. The following will do completions for the clojure.core namespace

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defmacro with-out-file [pathname &amp; body]
  `(with-open [stream# (new java.io.FileWriter ~pathname)]
    (binding [*out* stream#]
      ~@body)))

(def completions (keys (ns-publics (find-ns 'clojure.core))))
(with-out-file &quot;clj-keys.txt&quot; (doseq [x completions] (println x)))
&lt;/source&gt;

== needs much work ==

Wow, these instructions are atrocious.

== Knowledge collection ==

There is so much knowledge in the Google Group, IRC transcripts, official docs, actual code, screencasts, and what not. It's getting out of hand to learn all the small stuff like conventions, idioms, guidelines, principles of operation, and other stuff that's usually left out of the regular docs and, currently, out of this wiki.

Maybe there's a point to start a section for these small not-really-belonging-anywhere-else tidbits? E.g. What's Clojure convention for naming functions, camelCase or under_scores or dash-names? (dash-names).

What do you think?

== Approved revisions ==

The approved revision mechanism is killing this wiki. I'm avoiding even the smallest improvements due to this over-controlling mechanism. Please remove it and let the magic commence. [[Special:Contributions/62.0.132.222|62.0.132.222]] ([[User talk:62.0.132.222|talk]]) 10:43, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

I don't think there's a way to disable this, unfortunately.  [[Help:Revision_review#Automatic_editor_status_criteria]] explains how one can become an editor.  I think it's too much trouble, but the rules are being revised, apparently.  [[Special:Contributions/41.241.89.88|41.241.89.88]] ([[User talk:41.241.89.88|talk]]) 14:22, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I started serious pyhton programming one month ago. I have touched python several times, but found it very hard to start. The learning curve is steep.

This Wiki on Python programming help me a lot. Where the Python.org documentation is for experienced python programmers, the wiki is up to date and easy to understand. Especially the page about classes is excellent.

I would like this wiki on Python to be a good start point for beginners.

A lot of new python programmers are starting right now. The IronPython studio has been released. Many new to python will start look at the language. This Wiki can help these beginners to get a good first experience with python progamming. It is strongly needed, because the IronPython studion generates terrible python.

I am 45 years old. I have a family with wife and three kids of 9, 7 and 2 year. I work as a software architect on a Microsoft platform, .Net and C# in a good SCRUM team.</text>

==Acid-Base Reaction Theories==

Acids and bases are everywhere.  Some foods contain acid, like the citric acid in lemons and the lactic acid in dairy.  Cleaning products like bleach and ammonia are bases.  Chemicals that are acidic or basic are an important part of chemistry.

{{Helpful hint|hint=You may need to refresh your memory on [[General Chemistry/Naming Substances#Naming acids|naming acids]].}}
Several different theories explain what composes an '''acid''' and a '''base'''.  The first scientific definition of an acid was proposed by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the eighteenth century. He proposed that acids contained oxygen, although he did not know the dual composition of acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl).  Over the years, much more accurate definitions of acids and bases have been created.  

=== Arrhenius Theory ===
The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius published his theory of acids and bases in 1887. It can be simply explained by these two points:

{{TextBox|1=
; Arrhenius Acids and Bases
# An acid is a substance which dissociates in water to produce one or more hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).
# A base is a substance which dissociates in water to produce one or more hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).}}

[[Image:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|Svante Arrhenius]]
Based on this definition, you can see that Arrhenius acids must be soluble in water.  Arrhenius acid-base reactions can be summarized with three generic equations:
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA} \to \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{A}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|An acid will dissociate in water producing hydrogen ions.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{MOH} \to \hbox{M}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|A base (usually containing a metal) will dissociate in water to product hydroxide ions.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA}_{(aq)} + \hbox{MOH}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{MA}_{(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
|Acids and bases will neutralize each other when mixed.  They produce water and an ionic salt, neither of which are acidic or basic.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The Arrhenius theory is simple and useful.  It explains many properties and reactions of acids and bases.  For instance, mixing hydrochloric acid (HCl) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) results in a neutral solution containing table salt (NaCl).

However, the Arrhenius theory is not without flaws.  There are many well known bases, such as ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that do not contain the hydroxide ion.  Furthermore, acid-base reactions are observed in solutions that do not contain water.  To resolve these problems, there is a more advanced acid-base theory.

===Brønsted-Lowry Theory ===

The Brønsted-Lowry theory was proposed in 1923.  It is more general than the Arrhenius theory—all Arrhenius acids/bases are also Brønsted-Lowry acids/bases (but not necessarily vice versa).

{{TextBox|1=
;Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
# An acid is a substance from which a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion) can be removed. Essentially, an acid ''donates'' protons to bases.
# A base is a substance to which a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) can be added. Essentially, a base ''accepts'' protons from acids.}}

{{Wikipedia|Acid–base reaction}}
Acids that can donate only one proton are '''monoprotic''', and acids that can donate more than one proton are '''polyprotic'''.

These reactions demonstrate the behavior of Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases:
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+&lt;/math&gt;
|An acid (in this case, hydrochloric acid) will donate a proton to a base (in this case, water is the base).  The acid loses its proton and the base gains it.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_3 \to \hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_4^+&lt;/math&gt;
|Water is not necessary.  In this case, hydrochloric acid is still the acid, but ammonia acts as the base.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_4^+ \to \hbox{HCl} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_3&lt;/math&gt;
|The same reaction is happening, but now in reverse.  What was once an acid is now a base (HCl → Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and what was once a base is now an acid (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  This concept is called ''conjugates'', and it will be explained in more detail later.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl} + \hbox{NaOH} \to \hbox{NaCl} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{OH}^- \to 2 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
|Two examples of acids (HCl and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) mixing with bases (NaOH and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) to form neutral substances (NaCl and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaOH} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_3 \to \hbox{Na}^+ + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_2^-&lt;/math&gt;
|A base (sodium hydroxide) will accept a proton from an acid (ammonia).  A neutral substance is produced (water), which is not necessarily a part of every reaction.  Compare this reaction to the second one.  Ammonia was a base, and now it is an acid.  This concept, called ''amphoterism'', is explained later.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The Brønsted-Lowry theory is by far the most useful and commonly-used definition.  For the remainder of General Chemistry, you can assume that any acids/bases use the Brønsted-Lowry definition, unless stated otherwise.

[[Image:Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png|thumb|center|This Brønsted-Lowry acid donates a proton (in green) to water (the base).]]

===Lewis Theory===

The Lewis definition is the most general theory, having no requirements for solubility or protons.

{{TextBox|1=
; Lewis Acids and Bases
# An acid is a substance that accepts a lone pair of electrons.
# A base is a substance that donates a lone pair electrons.}}

Lewis acids and bases react to create an '''adduct''', a compound in which the acid and base have bonded by sharing the electron pair.  Lewis acid/base reactions are different from redox reactions because there is no change in oxidation state.

[[Image:Coordinate Covalent Bonding.svg|thumb|center|This reaction shows a Lewis base (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) donating an electron pair to a Lewis acid (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to form an adduct (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).]]

== Amphoterism and Water ==

Substances capable of acting as either an acid or a base are '''amphoteric'''.  Water is the most important amphoteric substance.  It can ionize into hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, a base) or hydronium (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an acid).  By doing so, water is
# Increasing the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (Arrhenius),
# Donating or accepting a proton (Brønsted-Lowry), and
# Accepting or donating an electron pair (Lewis).

A bare proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion) cannot exist in water.  It will form a hydrogen bond to the nearest water molecule, creating the '''hydronium ion''' (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  Although many equations and definitions may refer to the &quot;concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions&quot;, that is a misleading abbreviation.  Technically, there are no H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, only hydronium (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions.  Fortunately, the number of hydronium ions formed is exactly equal to the number of hydrogen ions, so the two can be used interchangeably.}}

[[Image:Hydronium-3D-balls.png|thumb|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions actually exist as hydronium, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Water will dissociate very slightly (which further explains its amphoteric properties).
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|The presence of hydrogen ions indicates an acid, whereas the presence of hydroxide ions indicates a base.  Being neutral, water dissociates into both equally.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|This equation is more accurate—hydrogen ions do not exist in water because they bond to form hydronium.
|}

=== Ammonia ===

Another common example of an amphoteric substance is ammonia.  Ammonia is normally a base, but in some reactions it can act like an acid.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{HCl} \to \hbox{NH}_4^+ + \hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|Ammonia acts as a base.  It accepts a proton to form ''ammonium''.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Li}_3\hbox{N} + 2 \hbox{NH}_3 \to 3\hbox{Li}^+ + 3\hbox{NH}_2^-&lt;/math&gt;
|Ammonia also acts as an acid.  Here, it donates a proton to form ''amide''.
|}

Ammonia's amphoteric properties are not often seen because ammonia typically acts like a base.  Water, on the other hand, is completely neutral, so its acid and base behaviors are both observed commonly.

==Conjugate Acids and Bases==

In all the theories, the products of an acid-base reaction are related to the initial reactants of the reaction. For example, in the Brønsted-Lowry theory, this relationship is the difference of a proton between a reactant and product. Two substances which exhibit this relationship form a '''conjugate acid-base pair'''. 

{{TextBox|
; Brønsted-Lowry Conjugate Pairs
* An acid that has donated its proton becomes a ''conjugate base''.
* A base that has accepted a proton becomes a ''conjugate acid''.}}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;{\color{Red}\mathcal{HI}_{(aq)}} + {\color{Blue}\mathbf{H}_2\mathbf{O}_{(l)}} \to {\color{Blue}\mathcal{I}^-_{(aq)}} + {\color{Red}\mathbf{H}_3\mathbf{O}^+_{(aq)}}&lt;/math&gt;
|Hydroiodic acid reacts with water (which serves as a base).  The conjugate base is the iodide ion and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion.  The acids are written in red, and the bases are written in blue.  One conjugate pair is written bold and the other conjugate pair is in cursive.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{\color{Blue}\mathcal{NH}_{3(aq)}} + {\color{Red}\mathbf{H}_2\mathbf{O}_{(l)}} \to {\color{Red}\mathcal{NH}^+_{4(aq)}} + {\color{Blue}\mathbf{OH}^-_{(aq)}}&lt;/math&gt;
|Ammonia (basic) reacts with water (the acid).  The conjugate acid is ammonium and the conjugate base is hydroxide.  Again, acids are written in red, and the bases are written in blue.  The conjugate pairs are distinguished with matching fonts.
|}

==Strong and Weak Acids/Bases==

A '''strong acid''' is an acid which dissociates completely in water. That is, ''all'' the acid molecules break up into ions and solvate (attach) to water molecules. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions in a strong acid solution is equal to the concentration of the acid.

The majority of acids exist as '''weak acids''', an acid which dissociates only partially.  On average, only about 1% of a weak acid solution dissociates in water in a 0.1 mol/L solution. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions in a weak acid solution is always less than the concentration of the dissolved acid.

'''Strong bases''' and '''weak bases''' do not require additional explanation; the concept is the same.

{{Info|The conjugate of a strong acid/base is very weak. The conjugate of a weak acid/base is not necessarily strong.}}
This explains why, in all of the above example reactions, the reverse chemical reaction does not occur.  The stronger acid/base will prevail, and the weaker one will not contribute to the overall acidity/basicity.  For example, hydrochloric acid is strong, and upon dissociation chloride ions are formed.  Chloride ions are a weak base, but the solution is not basic because the acidity of HCl is overwhelmingly stronger than basicity of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{Helpful hint|hint=Although the other halogens make strong acids, '''hydrofluoric acid''' (HF) is a weak acid.  Despite being weak, it is incredibly corrosive—hydrofluoric acid dissolves glass and metal!}}
Most acids and bases are weak.  You should be familiar with the most common strong acids and assume that any other acids are weak.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Formula
! Strong Acid
|-
| HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || Perchloric acid
|-
| HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || Nitric acid
|-
| H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || Sulfuric acid
|-
| HCl, HBr, HI || Hydrohalic acids
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Within a series of ''oxyacids'', the ions with the greatest number of oxygen molecules are the strongest.  For example, nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;'''3'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is strong, but nitrous acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is weak.  Perchloric acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is stronger than chloric acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is stronger than the weak chlorous acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is the weakest of the four.

Common strong bases are the hydroxides of Group 1 and most Group 2 metals.  For example, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are some of the strongest bases.  You can assume that any other bases (including ammonia and ammonium hydroxide) are weak.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Formula
! Strong Base
|-
| LiOH || Lithium hydroxide
|-
| NaOH || Sodium hydroxide
|-
| KOH || Potassium hydroxide
|-
| RbOH || Rubidium hydroxide
|-
| CsOH || Cesium hydroxide
|-
| Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Calcium hydroxide
|-
| Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Strontium hydroxide
|-
| Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Barium hydroxide
|}
{{ref|Brown_2009}}
&lt;/center&gt;

{{Yellow Warning|Acids and bases that are strong are not necessarily concentrated, and weak acids/bases are not necessarily dilute.  Concentration has nothing to do with the ability of a substance to dissociate.  Furthermore, ''polyprotic'' acids are not necessarily stronger than ''monoprotic'' acids.}}

==Properties of Acids and Bases==

Now that you are aware of the acid-base theories, you can learn about the physical and chemical properties of acids and bases.  Acids and bases have very different properties, allowing them to be distinguished by observation.

=== Indicators ===
[[Image:Bromothymol blue colors.jpg|thumb|'''Bromothymol blue''' is an indicator that turns blue in a base, or yellow in acid.]]
Made with special chemical compounds that react slightly with an acid or base, '''indicators''' will change color in the presence of an acid or base. A common indicator is '''litmus paper'''. Litmus paper turns red in acidic conditions and blue in basic conditions.  '''Phenolphthalein purple''' is colorless in acidic and neutral solutions, but it turns purple once the solution becomes basic.  It is useful when attempting to neutralize an acidic solution; once the indicator turns purple, enough base has been added.

=== Conductivity ===

A less informative method is to test for conductivity. Acids and bases in aqueous solutions will conduct electricity because they contain dissolved ions.  Therefore, acids and bases are ''electrolytes''.  Strong acids and bases will be strong electrolytes.  Weak acids and bases will be weak electrolytes.  This affects the amount of conductivity.

However, acids will react with metal, so testing conductivity may not be plausible.

=== Physical properties ===

{{Warning|The following is for informative purposes only. '''Do not sniff, touch, or taste any acids or bases''' as they may result in injury or death.}}

The physical properties of acids and bases are opposites.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
!Acids
!Bases
|-
!Taste
|sour
|bitter
|-
!Feel
|stinging
|slippery
|-
!Odor
|sharp
|odorless
|}

These properties are very general; they may not be true for every single acid or base.

Another warning:  if an acid or base is spilled, it must be cleaned up immediately and properly (according to the procedures of the lab you are working in).  If, for example, sodium hydroxide is spilled, the water will begin to evaporate.  Sodium hydroxide does not evaporate, so the concentration of the base steadily increases until it becomes damaging to its surrounding surfaces.

=== Chemical Reactions ===

==== Neutralization ====
Acids will react with bases to form a salt and water.  This is a '''neutralization''' reaction.  The products of a neutralization reaction are much less acidic or basic than the reactants were.  For example, sodium hydroxide (a base) is added to hydrochloric acid.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaOH}_{(aq)} + \hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{NaCl}_{(aq)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Double Replacement Reaction|double replacement]] reaction.

==== Acids ====
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} + \hbox{Zn}_{(s)} \to \hbox{ZnCl}_{2(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids react with metal to produce a metal salt and hydrogen gas bubbles.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_{4(aq)} + \hbox{CaCO}_{3(s)} \to \hbox{CaSO}_{4(s)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{CO}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids react with metal carbonates to produce water, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas bubbles, and a salt.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{HNO}_{3(aq)} + \hbox{Na}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)} \to 2 \hbox{NaNO}_{3(aq)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids react with metal oxides to produce water and a salt.
|}

==== Bases ====
Bases are typically less reactive and violent than acids.  They do still undergo many chemical reactions, especially with organic compounds.  A common reactions is ''saponificiation'': the reaction of a base with fat or oil to create soap.

[[Image:Saponification.png|thumb|250px|center|Saponification converts an &quot;ester&quot; into an &quot;alcohol&quot; and salt.  This is an [[Organic Chemistry|organic reaction]] outside the scope of General Chemistry.]]

      <comment>Separated Lists and Records Into Two Different Sections</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For the best results, you should have Script Editor open, so you can test the code and results as you read.

== Basics of Lists ==
Applescript has two data structures, '''lists''' and '''records'''. A list is an ordered collection of objects. Ordered, in the sense that items can be retrieved by index, and of objects because you can put anything into a list with anything else.

List creation is simple, anything that you put between a &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is a list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
set myList to {} -- make a new list
set myList to myList &amp; {1, &quot;two&quot;, {3}, {fred:&quot;barney&quot;, wilma:&quot;betty&quot;, foo:&quot;bar&quot;}, 5} -- add a bunch of items to the list
set k to {6, &quot;seven&quot;, {8}, {george:&quot;jetson&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;, judy:&quot;jetson&quot;}, 0}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above we create two lists. The first list &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; contains 5 items, the number 1, a string &quot;two&quot;, a list containing the number 3, a record containing three properties, ''fred'', ''wilma'', and ''foo'' with string values, and the number 5. 

We can access these items in several ways. The statements

&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
item 3 of myList
third item of myList
myList's third item
myList's item 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Will all return the same value, &lt;code&gt;{3}&lt;/code&gt;, that is, a list containing the number 3.

=== Looping Through a String As If It Were a List ===

This works a character at a time. (Strings are sequences of characters and behave accordingly.)
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt; 
set my_string to &quot;freedom is not freedom fries&quot;
repeat with counter_variable_name from 1 to count of my_string
	set current_character to item counter_variable_name of my_string
end repeat
&lt;/source&gt;

== Basics of Records ==

A record is a list of '''properties'''. You can retrieve items from a record by name, but not by index. For example, to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;elroy&lt;/code&gt; of the property list &lt;code&gt;{scooby:&quot;doo&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;,grape:&quot;ape&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;, I can retrieve it by name.
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
elroy of {scooby:&quot;doo&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;, grape:&quot;ape&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Which will return the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;jetson&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

but not by index, 
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
item 2 of {scooby:&quot;doo&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;, grape:&quot;ape&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Which returns an error.

      <comment>I added one important function and changed one mistake. Now the commands work properly.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial, we will plot a set of random, uniformly distributed, points on the surface of a sphere. This seems like a trivial task, but we will see that the &quot;obvious&quot; solution is actually incorrect. We will start off with this incorrect method, and then improve it to be correct.

== Incorrect Method ==

[[File:Spherical Coordinates (Colatitude, Longitude).svg|right|200px|thumb|The Spherical Coordinate system we are using.]]
In order to plot a point on a sphere's surface, we need two numbers: the colatitude, ''φ'' and the longitude, ''θ''. We could use the latitude, which is given by 90°−''φ'', but colatitude is the conventional quantity to deal with.

Now, we will make the simplistic assumption that we can use a uniform distribution for both the colatitude and longitude. We will plot 6000 points over a half sphere only, as this will allow us to see the results more clearly.

Let's define these distributions:

 theta := RandomReal[ {0, Pi} ]; (* Uniform on [0,Pi], longitude, only goes halfway round*)
 phi   := RandomReal[ {0, Pi} ]; (* Uniform on [0,Pi], colatitude, from pole to pole *)

You can easily alter the angle covered by changing the &lt;tt&gt;{0, Pi}&lt;/tt&gt; to your desired boundaries.

Notice that we have used the &quot;set delayed&quot; operator (&lt;tt&gt;:=&lt;/tt&gt;). We need this because when we build a table of the values in the next step, we want the &lt;tt&gt;Random[]&lt;/tt&gt; function to be called for each entry. If we do not do this, the values of &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; will be set above and never changed, resulting in 6000 identical points. We now make the table of data:

&lt;pre&gt;
dataPoints = Table[
   {phi, theta},
   {6000}];
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's have a look at the distribution of the points:

&lt;pre&gt;
rectPlot = ListPlot[
  dataPoints,
  AxesLabel -&gt; {&quot;\[Phi]&quot;, &quot;\[Theta]&quot;},
  Ticks -&gt; {
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi},
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi}}
  ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This produces the following output. We see that the points indeed appear to be uniformly distributed.

[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 1.png|centre]]

We will now map these spherical coordinates into the Cartesian space. This transformation is standard:

:&lt;math&gt; x = r \sin\phi \cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = r \sin\phi \sin\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \cos\phi \,&lt;/math&gt;

For our purposes, we will set ''r''=1. We make a function called &lt;tt&gt;sphericalToCartesian&lt;/tt&gt; to transform each two-element coordinate &lt;tt&gt;{φ,θ}&lt;/tt&gt; in the spherical system to a three-element coordinate,&lt;tt&gt;{x,y,z}&lt;/tt&gt;, in the Cartesian system.

&lt;pre&gt;
sphericalToCartesian[{phi_, theta_}] :=
  {Sin[phi]*Cos[theta],
   Sin[phi]*Sin[theta],
   Cos[phi]};
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have a mapping, so all that remains is to apply it using the &quot;map&quot; operator, &lt;tt&gt;/@&lt;/tt&gt;, which will perform this on each point in &lt;tt&gt;dataPoints&lt;/tt&gt;:

 mappedPoints = sphericalToCartesian /@ dataPoints;

Now that we have a set of points in the Cartesian system, we would like to see them. We make a set of points located at each point in &lt;tt&gt;mappedPoints&lt;/tt&gt; and show it. Here, we have the default view, and orthographic views from the top and front:

&lt;pre&gt;
 points = Graphics3D[Point /@ mappedPoints];

 Show[points]
 Show[points, ViewPoint-&gt;{0,Infinity,0)}]
 Show[points, ViewPoint-&gt;{0,0,Infinity)}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

{| align=center
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 2.png|centre|250px]]
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 3.png|centre|250px]]
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 4.png|centre|250px]]
|}

We see that the points are certainly ''not'' distributed evenly - they are much more dense at the poles. This is because the mapping from spherical to Cartesian coordinates does not preserve area - the spherical space is pinched and compressed at the poles by the mapping. In order to fix this, we must alter our original distributions.

== The Correct Method ==

In order to find the correct distribution for &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt;, we must consider the [[w:Jacobian determinant|Jacobian determinant]] of the mapping &lt;tt&gt;sphericalToCartesian&lt;/tt&gt;. This will tell us how the spherical space is pinched by the transformation at each point.

We must find the Jacobian matrix first. We will leave ''r'' in for the moment, as Mathematica will be crunching the numbers. The evaluated Jacobian matrix is shown below, but we will let Mathematica work it out from the beginning.

:&lt;math&gt;J_F(r,\phi,\theta) =\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial x}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \phi} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \\[3pt]
\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \phi} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \theta} \\[3pt]
\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \phi} &amp; \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \theta} \\
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 
	\sin\phi \cos\theta &amp; r \cos\phi \cos\theta  &amp; -r \sin\phi \sin\theta \\
	\sin\phi \sin\theta &amp;  r \cos\phi \sin\theta &amp; r \sin\phi \cos\theta \\ 
	\cos\phi            &amp; -r \sin\phi            &amp;  0                    
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

We will construct this matrix very easily using the &lt;tt&gt;Outer[]&lt;/tt&gt; function, which takes every possible combinations of each element except the first, and gives them as arguments to the function in the first element. Again, we must not evaluate this yet, as if we do, Mathematica will take the inputs &lt;tt&gt;f_&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;x_&lt;/tt&gt; as &quot;atomic,&quot; meaning that they cannot be broken down and therefore are unsuitable for inputs to &lt;tt&gt;Outer[]&lt;/tt&gt;.

 jacMat[f_, x_] := Outer[D, f, x]

This statement will take a list of directions (i.e. ''r'', ''φ'', ''θ''), and a list of the same length of functions, which are the mappings taking these to the target space, in this case, Cartesian. This simple statement doesn't check that you have given it lists as inputs, and doesn't ensure they are same length. However, we know the lengths are right, so we won't bother with this.

We now define the list of directions. First, we must remove our previous definitions of &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt;, (and &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; for good measure) as at the moment, they will inject a single random number each into the above statement, rather than a symbolic quantity. We also define the list of functions, which can be obtained by giving our now-symbolic directions as arguments to &lt;tt&gt;sphericalToCartesian&lt;/tt&gt;.

 sphericalToCartesian[{r_, phi_, theta_}] := {r*Sin[phi]*Cos[theta],  r*Sin[phi]*Sin[theta], r*Cos[phi]};

&lt;pre&gt;

Remove[r, phi, theta]
dirs = {r, phi, theta}
map = sphericalToCartesian[{r, phi, theta}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

In order to find the Jacobian matrix and determinant, we now put:

&lt;pre&gt;
jacMat[map, dirs]
Simplify[Det[%]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The output is:

&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
{{Cos[theta] Sin[phi], -r Sin[phi] Sin[theta],  r Cos[phi] Cos[theta]}, 
 {Sin[phi] Sin[theta],  r Cos[theta] Sin[phi],  r Cos[phi] Sin[theta]}, 
 {Cos[phi],             0,                     -r Sin[phi]}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;r^2 Sin[phi]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

We see that the Jacobian matrix is rearranged, but in Jacobians, it is exactly equivalent, as it just depends on the order of specification of the directions and functions. The Jacobian determinant is independent of the longitude, &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt;, so our uniform distribution in spherical coordinates will be uniform in Cartesian space. However, &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; will not be, as as it changes, the Jacobian also changes. &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; also does this, but as we can just deal with a unit sphere, we can cut it out of the equation now.

There exists a method called the &quot;Inverse CDF Method&quot; which allows us to generate samples of a given probability density function from a set of uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1 (just like Mathematica's &lt;tt&gt;Random[]&lt;/tt&gt;).

To use this method, we must first find the CDF of the PDF given by the Jacobian determinant. We normalise (to give a total probability of 1) by dividing by the area under the curve. &lt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; is a dummy variable.
&lt;pre&gt;
area = Integrate[Sin[t], {t, 0, Pi}];(*Area under PDF*)
cdf[y_] = Integrate[Sin[t]/area, {t, 0, y}](*CDF*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We now find the inverse of the CDF:

&lt;pre&gt;
Solve[x == cdf[y], y](*Get distribution transform*)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
{{y -&gt; -2 ArcSin[Sqrt[x]]}, {y -&gt; 2 ArcSin[Sqrt[x]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

We take the positive solution, and we can now set our &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; distributions:

&lt;pre&gt;
 theta := RandomReal[ {0, Pi} ]; (* Uniform on [0,Pi], longitude, only goes halfway round*)
 phi   := 2 ArcSin[Sqrt[Random[]]]; (* Colatitude, from pole to pole *)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We now plot the points exactly as before:
&lt;pre&gt;
dataPoints = Table[{phi, theta}, {6000}];
rectPlot = ListPlot[
  dataPoints,
  AxesLabel -&gt; {&quot;\[Phi]&quot;, &quot;\[Theta]&quot;},
  Ticks -&gt; {
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi},
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi}}
  ]
sphericalToCartesian[{phi_, theta_}] := 
  {Sin[phi]*Cos[theta], 
   Sin[phi]*Sin[theta], 
   Cos[phi]};

mappedPoints = sphericalToCartesian /@ dataPoints;
points = Graphics3D[Point /@ mappedPoints];
Show[points]
Show[points, ViewPoint -&gt; {0, 0, Infinity}]
Show[points, ViewPoint -&gt; {0, Infinity, 0}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 5.png|centre]]

We have reduced the distribution density around the poles.

|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 7.png|centre|250px]]
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 8.png|centre|250px]]
|}

We have now made it so that the points are evenly distributed over the spherical area.

To differentiate the field of Communication into sub classes may include a split from [[Communication Theory]] of Telecommunications theory. Communications has excellent subclasses already (small group communication, face-to-face communication, rhetoric and others) but the predominance and pervasive reality of mass media suggests at least a new field of study. 

This book will build on the [[Communication Theory]] book already being worked on.  For this book, we will deal exclusively with mass media messages mediated through technological forms. This covers telegraph, telephone, radio, television and the networked computer. In this case the channel in the standard communication model (transmitter – channel – receiver) will always be technologically related.  

Like the Communication Theory book, this book approaches telecommunication theory from a biographical perspective, in an attempt to show theory development within a social context. Many of these theorists would not actually consider themselves &quot;telecommunication&quot; researchers. Like communications, the field of telecommunication study is remarkably inclusionary, and integrates theoretical perspectives originally developed in a range of other disciplines.


Sections to include:

* Reasons why telecommunications theory is needed
* Perspectives on Theory

==Theorists and Approaches to Telecommunications==
To gain a comprehensive view of telecommunications theory, each approach theory or model will need its own page covering major points of the theory, its origin, criticisms and current state.  

* [[/Hypodermic Needle Theory/]]
* [[/Modeling and Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication/]]
* [[/Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing/]] (LC4MP)
* [[/Cultivation/]]

Hi Typewriter,

It looks like you created several pages today (and yesterday) that should probably be collected under a single book (perhaps they were intended to be chapters of the [[Telecommunications Theory]] book?  If so, would you please move them?  Here's a short list, but there may be more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= TBALIAS =
=== Statement ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
TBALIAS oldName,NewName 
=== Description ===
&lt;p&gt;As the Mac OS matures, terse and economical toolbox names give way to more descriptive names. In C, this spells disaster because there is no way to stay in step except to go through all of your projects and change the name of the toolbox call to match Apple's latest syntax. FB offers a more elegant solution by providing an alias. A toolbox alias is a synonym that FB uses to translate all of your old syntax into the latest PPC toolbox names. This happens more often than you might imagine. Some common aliases are shown below: TBAlias InsertMenuItem , InsMenuItem
TBAlias DeleteMenuItem , DelMenuItem
TBAlias GetMenuHandle , GetMHandle
TBAlias CountMItems , CountMenuItems
TBAlias GetControlValue , GetCtlValue Without these TBALIAS statements, your existing code would break when it used a common toolbox like GETMHANDLE. With the alias in place, FB sees &quot;GETMHANDLE&quot; and automatically translates it to &quot;GETMENUHANDLE&quot;. The result is that your old code continues to work in a modernized environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= TEHANDLE =

=== Function ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
editFieldHandle&amp; = TEHANDLE(fieldID)
fieldInfo = TEHANDLE(-fieldID) 
=== Description ===
This function returns information about an edit field or picture field in the current output window. If you use the first syntax (passing a positive value to TEHANDLE), TEHANDLE returns a handle to the TextEdit record associated with the specified field. Although a valid handle will also be returned for picture fields, this is really more useful in the case of edit fields. The following table lists some of the more useful elements that can be found in the field's TextEdit record. The syntax shown in the table assumes that the value returned by TEHANDLE has been assigned to a long integer variable teH&amp;. IMAGE imgs/TEHANDLE_function02.gif (Note: for a description of other elements in the TextEdit record, see the &quot;TextEdit&quot; chapter in Inside Macintosh: Text.) If you use the second syntax (passing a negative value to TEHANDLE), TEHANDLE returns a value identifying the field's type, as follows: IMAGE imgs/TEHANDLE_function04.gif Example:
This function returns the next available ID number that is not currently being used by any picture field or edit field in the current window. LOCAL FN GetUnusedFieldID
   DIM id
   id = 0
   DO
INC(id)
   UNTIL TEHANDLE(-id) = 0
END FN = id Note:
You should generally not alter the contents of a TextEdit record directly. Use TextEdit Toolbox routines, or FB statements like EDIT FIELD, to alter the characteristics of the field. If you use TEHANDLE to get a TextEdit record handle, you should not dispose of the handle. The memory associated with the edit field is automatically disposed when you close the edit field (using EDIT FIELD CLOSE) or close its window (using WINDOW CLOSE).

::'''Comment''' There actually is a computer game: Dungeons and Dragons Online. However, without the Online bit, it is still a game... arguably, the father of all role-playing games, computer-based or not. I choose not to vote, because I can't be unbiased; if I were to vote, it would be [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''.

:'''Comment''' - I do think that a very legitimate text could be developed on this topic.  This is something that has a deep and rich history, and has been a tremendous creative standard that many subsequent games, including many video games, have been developed.  This said, I'm not sure if this particular outline could be developed into anything other than what is essentially a duplicate of the D&amp;D rulebooks.  On that point, it is either a copyvio or [[WB:OR]].  I don't think [[WB:GUIDE]] really applies in this situation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 07:17, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

:{{keep}} - This is a game with a long history and cultural significants.

:{{neutral}} I don't think that there is a stark demarcation between &quot;video games&quot; and games which are not videogames. In any strategy guide, there is really a continuum where we need to judge cultural significance to some degree, and we also need to judge the educational opportunities in the book. I think we all would agree that [[Chess]] is generally acceptable because of it's significance. [[Doom]], it was almost unanimous, did not belong here. What's really the difference between these two books about games? Just because a particular game is a board game and not a video game, does that mean that it doesnt have the cultural transience of a no-name videogame? Is Dungeons &amp; Dragons significant enough to warrant a strategy guide here, and, if we required, would that book be able to justify it's presence here on an educational books site? I think that in this case, yes, Dungeons &amp; Dragons is worthwhile to have here, but I don't say that because of some kind of blanket policy that board games are suitable book topics. However, my opinion on this matter is not strong enough to warrant a keep. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:11, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This small book aims to be a practical guide to essay writing. A generic approach to writing is introduced, enabling you to write in a clear and structured way, while at the same time allowing you to develop your own argument in a creative way. A good essay combines your own content with a clear structure.

I wrote this book because many mistakes in writing essays are unnecessarily repeated time and time again. These mistakes can easily be avoided, and will allow you to get the credit you deserve. Nothing in this document is rocket science, but most students enter university without having been taught how to write effectively. Merely by studying at a university, however, no-one will learn how to write good essays. By following just a few steps, most mediocre essays can be improved. I tried to include many examples taken from my own essays to make this guide a practical one.

A key idea that I wish to convey, is that it really matters ''why'' we write an essay. There is no universal approach to writing, and the reason of writing will be the best guide as to ''how'' to write. It’ll guide us to ''whom'' we write for, what level of details we include, what kind of language we choose, and so on.

==Audience==

The audience is for whom we write. In the situation of a university essay, the audience is often imaginary. That is not to say that your essay will not be read properly, but that the person for whom you write sometimes actually differs slightly from who is marking your essay.

Assuming your essay is being marked by a knowledgeable teaching assistant, why write at all? She might know everything you have to say, or even know it better; on the other hand, you might be writing an essay about an area your marker does not specialize in. Hard to tell? The solution is to pitch your essay towards a reasonably well educated person, but one who lacks the specific expertise. Imagine someone who has done an introductory course in your subject, for example.

By writing for an educated person, you no longer have to explain some of the fundamental aspects of your subject matter. However, it’ll still be necessary to explain some of the more specialized issues—maybe just to remind your reader. Practically speaking, pitching your essay this way means that a non-specialist will not be lost when reading your writing. It’s a useful skill to write difficult things in a relatively easy way. At the same time, if your essay is read by your really knowledgeable teaching assistant, she will immediately see that you have grasped the subject matter: that you know what you’re writing about.

Sometimes, the question you’re set will clearly say what kind of style and level of language is expected. A conventional essay is not the same as a report, nor the same as a press briefing, an entry in an encyclopaedia, or a memo. In each case, you’ll have to think about the particular needs: who is your (imaginary) reader, what will they know, what will they want to know?

==Preparation==

When chefs prepare a meal, they often put all the necessary ingredients on the table before starting (''mise en place''). This is a good way to make sure everything is ready. With essay writing the process is similar. We don’t jump in straight away and start writing, but instead spend a few moments thinking about what we want to achieve in our essay. What do we want to communicate? You may think of these considerations as a plan of attack.

What are the essential ingredients of an essay then? First of all, you should know what you’re going to write. Once you know that, you probably want to consider some examples to illustrate the argument. Illustrations have two functions: firstly, they show that what you write is relevant, and secondly they make your argument more approachable. Having worked out the content—what you’re going to include—you’ll also need to think a little bit about the structure: in what order you’re going to say it. The approach introduced in this book will help you with this task.

==What Goes In—What Stays Out?==

Planning an essay can be difficult. Sometimes there is just too much that you could write about; at other times there just does not seem to be enough. The following approach may help you to decide what you include in your essay, and equally important, what you don’t.

* Brainstorming: Write down the key concepts of the essay in the centre of a page, and link as many ideas that come to mind. If you’re unsure what the key concepts are, look out for terms you have come across a lot when reading. In many cases, you’re looking for arguments for and against a proposition, so take care to include both sides. If there is no argument against something, make a note of it. Don’t be shy to state what you think of the different points.

* More material: Once you’re reasonably happy with the ideas you have collected, you should go back to your course material. Sometimes the essay question will identify relevant material for you, but most of the time, it’s up to you and your notes. Obviously, if you need more material, this step is important to identify further points to include. It may not strike you as obvious, that you should never skip this extra step, even if you have collected tons of ideas in step one. Going back to your course material will not only ensure you have not missed something important, but also help you decide whether your points are balanced.

* Grouping: By now you should have a reasonably large collection of ideas linked to your key concepts, and it’s time to think about structure. Use coloured pens, numbers, letters of the alphabet, symbols—whatever works for you—and try to group similar ideas together. You might find points for and against a proposition, different theories, or the different components of the concept you’re examining.

* Selection: At this stage, you should be very selective. You might have tons of ideas that are linked to the question, but we are not normally interested in quantity. Go over the different points and ask yourself whether they are relevant to your answer. Does this particular point tell us anything new? Be rigorous, and kick out anything that will not help answering the question.

* Illustrations: Having decided what stays in, try to think of useful examples. An example is useful if it’s apparent how it links with your argument. If you need an extra paragraph just to establish the link, then you might not have picked the most suitable example. It’s often possible to use the same example for different points.

* Ordering: Now that you know what goes into your essay, think about the order. The way you grouped the ideas will determine much, and should you have time to spare, you even might want to consider alternative approaches: and then pick the best one. Realistically, we never have that much time, and you should focus on a coherent line of thought. Sometimes it’s reasonable to first look at the arguments for, then those against, and finally mitigate. At other times, it makes sense to look at what different theories say in turn, or work from one example to the other. What is important is that there is a clear line of thought, where one bit builds on the other. Make a note of this ordering, and you have just written most of your outline.

Why do we bother going through this procedure? It helps to work like chefs do: having all the necessary ingredients at hand before starting with the actual writing. Imagine a chef starting to bake a lemon tart, finding out half way though that he only has strawberries in the fridge. Surely he can cobble something together, maybe even produce very nice strawberry tartlets. This is no problem for our chef preparing a meal for the family at the weekend, but what about if he entered a competition for the best lemon tart in town?

[[Image:Essay Planner.png|Example Essay Planner|thumb]]

I use a special essay organizer to make sure everything is in place before I start writing. You can use this template, or create your own. At the top I collect the course the essay is for. Normally I use the abbreviations the university uses, or make up my own where there are no such given abbreviations. I also record the number, such as 3 for the third essay in that particular course. The deadline comes in big letters at the top. The essay question is central, so I copy this onto my planner. To make sure that I have understood the question, I rephrase it. Ticking the format needed (essay, report) and word limit makes me aware of these. Similarly, I collect the process and content word separately, making sure that I really identified them. The relevant material is also collected. I usually use the name of the author, or simply ''chapter 3''. The key concepts and theories have their separate place at the centre. Sometimes your tutor or the written instructions will tell you that a particular skill is focused on: I make a note of these, too. Under ''Approach'' I take a note of some key points or illustrations that just have to go in. I also write down any hints or considerations regarding the structure.

In the bottom half of the organizer, I work these hints into a proper outline with an introduction, definitions, a main body (with sections), and a conclusion. I usually assign a certain number of words to each section, and write them down, too. There is also space for notes and references. At the very bottom I include what essay skills I want to pay particular attention to. If my tutor mentioned that I should use more examples, that’s what comes here. This way I make sure that I at least try to improve on the previous essay. See the section on [[Writing_Better_University_Essays/Using feedback|using feedback]].

Using some time to prepare your essay will make sure that you answer the question, and thus you maintain your chances of winning that competition for the best lemon tart in town… None of this work preparing the essay will be wasted. On the one hand you have made sure you have everything ready to write this essay: no more running out of ideas half way through. On the other hand, your marker will appreciate an essay which is both relevant and coherent.

==Getting Directions==

Before you can start writing, you have to make sure you understand the question. Some questions are difficult to understand, but usually there are lots of clues as to what is expected. Look out for content and process words. Content words tell you what you’re going to write about. Process words, on the other hand, tell you how to do it.

It’s a good idea to spend a few moments identifying the content and process words. You may want to underline them in different colours. Once you really know what your task is, you’re ready to go. There is a simple way to check yourself whether you have understood the question set: rephrase it. If you’re able to write down the question again, using your own words, then you can be sure you know what the question is about. Make sure, though, that you really use your own words, and not just reshuffle the different bits in the question.

For example, take the following question: “Distinguishing between conformity, deviance and crime aids our understanding of British society. Discuss.” First of all, you want to identify the process word, which tells you what kind of answer is required. In this case, the process word is ''discuss''. What are the content words? The question tells you to focus on ''British society''. This does not mean that you can’t bring in an example from the US, for instance, but that you should focus on Britain. Maybe the examples in your course were from the US, and the examiners are keen to see how you apply this to the British case? The question gives you further clues: ''conformity'', ''deviance'', and ''crime'' are the key concepts you should use in your answer. It’s these words that I would brainstorm before writing.

To make sure you have understood the question, try to rephrase it. Use your own words, and write it down. One way to rephrase the question is: “If you want to understand British society, it helps to distinguish between conformity, deviance, and crime.” In this case I have not bothered to rephrase the key concepts. This is OK, because I will need to define the key concepts anyway. In most cases, however, try not to use any of the words from the original.

Unfortunately, identifying the content and process words is not always a straightforward task. Sometimes you have to read a bit between the lines, identifying the implicit tasks. Every essay question has some implications that are not immediately apparent. Look out for assumptions, schools of thoughts, or particular theories. Often, essay questions include a statement to be discussed. Such statements in many cases make quite strong assumptions about the world, or follow a certain school of thought. Although these links are not physically written in the question, they too are content words. If you’re trying to get very good grades, it’s important that you identify such assumptions and work with them.

Here you find a list of [[Writing_Better_University_Essays/Process words|process words]].

Why should we bother with process and content words? You might consider this all a waste of time. Unfortunately, most essays that fail or get a poor grade are essays that don’t answer the question. Sometimes, the markers get essays that are brilliantly written, but they can’t give a good mark, because the question set is just not addressed. You’re not primarily assessed in your ability to write eloquently, or for showing off how much you have read or learnt this term: what you’re assessed on is how well you answer the question.

This book introduces a simple yet powerful approach that is flexible enough to allow creativity in what you write. Bearing in mind the reason why you write, following this simple approach your essays will come with the necessary structure and be focused on the question set. You still have to write it yourself though…

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Structure=

There is a simple structure that you can follow for your essays. The details of this approach are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections. The key idea of this approach is writing in a structured manner, focusing on answering the question or problem presented by the assignment. Not only does this approach help you making sure your answer is relevant, but also will it guide your reader through your writing. There are specific parts to your essay that you should never leave out, such as an introduction and a conclusion. These and the remaining parts should be developed and based upon your answer to two primary questions: Who am I writing for, and what is my purpose? The answers to these two questions should determine what is included, what is important and what is unnecessary in your essay. Whilst the approach outlined here is very useful for general essays, bear in mind that at times your university work will take different forms. For example, if you must write a report or dictionary entry, these structures may need adapting. The key ideas presented here, however, can be applied to other forms of writing as well. 

First of all, you ''delimit''. By this I mean that in your introduction, you address the question and set the focus of the essay. You should not only state how you understand the question or problem, but also how you decide what ideas are not relevant. Next up, you’ll need to ''define'' key terms. The idea is the same as before: to demonstrate that you’re aware of different interpretations, but also making sure that your readers understand things in the same way.

The ''main part'' of your essay is where you do the actual writing. Here you follow the outline you devised during preparation, making sure that it all links to a coherent answer. Next, it’s important to ''discuss'' the implications of your answer. If you discuss strengths and weaknesses of an approach, this is where you want to evaluate them. Now you’re done, and you demonstrate this in your ''conclusion''. The conclusion demonstrates that you have actually delivered what you promised in the introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Delimiting the Question=

First of all, it’s necessary to state to the reader how you understand the question. Not only raises this expectations, but also can you demonstrate that you’re focused. Furthermore, you’ll avoid that your reader will misunderstand you, or think that you have left out critical aspects. For example, if your question is about crime, you may want to delimit this to contemporary white-collar crime in Britain. Your reader will not be puzzled not to read about the dungeons in medieval France, since you stated that these will not be addressed here. By explicitly delimiting your answer, you also demonstrate that you’re aware of the greater picture, or the other possible interpretations. This bit should be as short as possible, but never leave it out.

In an exam situation, it’s very important to delimit your answers. Sometimes a particular question is, to a certain extent, tied to a particular module or even a single lecture. By delimiting your answer, you demonstrate that you’re aware of this link. In other cases questions are much more open. In these cases you also need to delimit your answer. The limits of your analysis are both in terms of content (the medieval dungeons in France) and theories (such as feminist perspectives on consumption). Delimiting works in two ways: saying what is in, and stating what is out.

You may imagine that the essay question is a brief for a job. You have landed the task described, but have not the time to do it yourself. As you are in charge, you decide on a contractor. Think about which contractor is best suited to fulfil the task. In the social sciences, the contractors often are theories or schools of thought. Once you decide who is best suited for the job, you should state so, and also include a brief justification. It’s not uncommon that you’ll want to hire out different parts of the job to different contractors.

For example, take the following question: “What kind of mechanisms can explain sudden changes in collective action?” As a typical essay question, it leaves lots of scope. Practically, we can never write everything we know about the topic. Just like we can’t try out all the contractors to build a house and decide later on which one was best, we need to make decisions here, too. We want to quash diversions before they develop, and signal to the reader that we know what we are writing about. Answering this question, I might want to focus on tipping models. However, I am aware that there are alternatives, and will state that these will not be ignored completely. By stating, for example, “this essay will focus on tipping models, but alternative approaches will also be outlined briefly,” I signal that I know that tipping models are not the only way to go.

==Guiding the Reader==

After delimiting the answer, we will need a short outline. On the one hand this gives the reader some sort of direction. This can be really useful, if we are not so successful at linking the different sections later on. The reader will already have an idea what comes up, and not get lost, even if a paragraph diverts a little bit. An essay with an outline will almost always come across as more coherent. On the other hand, the outline will make sure that you—the writer—know where you’re going. In other words, an essay with an outline will almost always ''be'' more coherent.

Such an outline can be understood as guiding the reader. It should be short, because it does not actually answer the question. It should, however, be long enough, to include all the main sections that will be included. Because the guide will be kept general, it acts as a guide to you as the writer, too, not as a straitjacket. The following is an example of such an outline:

: ''This report describes the experience of carrying out a survey in order to measure cultural capital. The actual questions used in the survey are discussed, as are the sampling process and the data collection method. This is followed by an examination of the scale building, with a focus on reliability and validity. At each step, the actual work done is critically examined with regards to how it could have been done better. A short discussion about whether anything was learned about cultural capital completes this report, but first the definition and conceptualization of cultural capital needs to be addressed.''

Such an outline gives an idea of what is going to be addressed in the answer, and also roughly in what order. The length of the guide will depend on the essay. A much shorter version is just as good in a different context:

:''This paper critically reviews an article by Katz-Gerro (2002) that examines this link. In order to do so, there is a focus on research design and the persuasiveness of the results, but other aspects such as the mechanisms included will not be ignored.''

There is a simple trick to make your outline a little bit more interesting: keep the first topic you’ll write about until the end of the outline. So in your outline, you state in order what you’ll do, only that the first topic is mentioned last. The longer example just above makes use of this trick. Use phrases like “firstly, however, it is necessary to”, or “but before these are discussed, it will be useful to consider first of all.” Not only does this raise expectations, but also does this give you a chance to demonstrate the relevance of the opening section after the introduction. This sense of direction is something your readers will appreciate.

==When to Write the Introduction==

There are different views on when it’s best to write the introduction. Many write it first, because they write the essay from beginning to end. This is not a good justification as such. It’s a good idea to write the introduction first, because the introduction will delimit the answer, and provide an outline. As such, by writing the introduction, you commit yourself to a plan. It also helps you to stay focused.

This view is countered by those who argue that you never really know where you end up when writing an essay. This is the case, because writing the essay itself is a process by which the outcome—or conclusion—is not always known. Even where you have an idea, where the essay will take you, you might not know the precise details. For these reasons, some write the introduction last: after completing the essays and writing the conclusion. The benefit is that the introduction is about the essay as it exists, not about the essay as it was initially intended. As a consequence, the introduction will never make false promises and be tightly focused.

Probably the best alternative is to combine the two, especially when using a word processor where you can change what you wrote. Start with writing the introduction. This will help you stay focused, and make sure you think about the structure and order of the answer before you start writing. This is a good way to make sure the answer is relevant. However, after completing the essay, you come back to the introduction, and modify it as necessary. Maybe the focus has changed; maybe there is now an extra section. Having a careful plan before writing will mean that such changes are often of minor nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Process Words=
On this page you find a list of process words that are often used. This list is in part based on Jordan (1999). The process words are given in alphabetical order. Probably the most common process words are: ''discuss'', ''describe'', ''explain'', ''compare'', ''evaluate'', and ''criticize''.

'''Account for''' asks for an explanation. Even thought it looks similar to give an account of, this process word is rather different. You should give a description with details. The description should clarify the concept, and don’t forget to give reasons.

'''Analyze''' calls for an outline of the components. Take the issue, and break it down (divide) into the parts that make up the issue. Your task is not only to describe the different parts of the issue, but also to show (examine) how they relate to each other.

'''Argue''' is about making a case. You’re often asked to argue for or against something. In order to make a good case, your answer will need to include convincing evidence. Your argument will be more convincing if it’s logically structured. Even though the question often asks for a one-sided case, don’t forget the arguments against: even if it’s to dismiss them. If you don’t agree with the proposition, this is fine: what counts is the case you present.

'''Assess''' asks you to make a judgement of the value or importance of something. Your answer should focus on both sides of the coin, weighing up the positive and negative aspects. It’s often necessary to spend much time on the areas that are disputed. In order to provide a credible answer, back up your answer with references and good examples. Even though you may have a good example from your own experience, it’s usually better to choose a more authoritative source.

'''Calculate''' asks you to estimate the extent of something. You should take great care to define the key dimensions and determine how they are measured. Weigh up different reasons carefully. In the social sciences, the estimate itself is often secondary to how you evaluate the key dimensions.

'''Characterize''' is mostly another word for describe. You’re looking for the key dimensions (characteristics) of a concept. Often it’s necessary to compare to other concepts to make clear the limit.

'''Classify''' is very similar to analyze. The key difference is possibly that this process word explicitly asks you to come up with some sort of classification: a way to divide. You probably want to spend a bit more time on the boundaries, on how the identified dimensions are different.

'''Comment''' is similar to the content words analyze and assess. It’s indeed often considered a combination of the two. Be careful not merely to summarize the issue, but include some form of evaluation. This process word asks you to explain the importance of something. Your ability to describe an issue is usually only appreciated in conjunction with a critical argument.

'''Compare''' always involves two or more issues. Focus on what characterizes the issues, and your answer will include both the similarities and differences. This content word often occurs in conjunction with contrast. Technically, compare is about similarities, but for a balanced answer you’ll need to include the differences, too. Your conclusion may include a statement of which of the issues or options discussed you consider preferable.

'''Consider''' asks you to think carefully about something. This process word is sometimes followed by an example or case study, but also a theoretical perspective. Take great care to include these aspects, because you’ll be (partly) marked on how well you apply whatever the question is to this particular example or theory.

'''Contrast''' is like a twin to compare. Two or more issues or options are involved, and your answer should focus on the differences. Technically, contrast does not ask you to include similarities, but a balanced answer will include these, too. Your conclusion may include a statement of which of the issues or options discussed you consider preferable.

'''Criticize''' asks for a careful judgement of a statement or point of view. You’re often asked to make statements about the value or truth of a statement. Make sure you point out faults. It’s important to state by which criteria of evaluation your answer is guided. Your illustrations should not be of general nature, but specific. If the illustrative examples are not general in nature, too, then say so. Your answer will judge the merit of the views included in the statement. Often you can—and should—link to underlying theories and approaches. These should be included in the evaluation, too. Your answer also needs to discuss the nature and quality of evidence you cited for and against the different views. Always back up your argument with evidence and reasoning.

'''Deduce''' asks you to reach a conclusion based on something. Make clear how you reach this conclusion.

'''Define''' may look innocent, but the devil is often in the detail. Similar to analyze, you’re after the components of an issue of concept. You don’t want just any definition, but one that discusses the different meanings of a concept, the different ways it can be interpreted. Often, you can link the answer to how different schools of thought use a term. In this case your task is to tease out the different understandings and state the different meanings. Your answer necessarily includes an appreciation of the different components, but you should also pay attention to the differences to other concepts: how is it distinct from something else. Precision is important in your answer, and your answer should always go beyond common-sense interpretations. Sometimes you’re asked to write for a specific audience, such as a student encyclopaedia, and you should bear this in mind.

'''Demonstrate''' asks you to show something as clearly as you can. You’ll need to use an example (illustration) to this extent. Make sure the illustration is relevant and state clearly how it is relevant.

'''Describe''' is one of the most straight-forward tasks. You’re asked to outline the main aspects of an issue or point of view. Say what something is like. Sometimes the order of events is important. Your answer should always include illustrative examples to bring the argument alive. The structure of the answer is important: don’t jump around, picking up bits and pieces on the way. Instead, plan a logical and coherent way in order to cover all the main aspects. This process word often occurs together with others, such as in describe and criticize.

'''Determine''' asks you to find out something, maybe to calculate or estimate something. You should always describe how you arrive at the answer, including an appreciation of how not to proceed. Be open about the shortcomings or potential dangers of your approach.

'''Differentiate between''' something and something else is a combination of describe and define. You’re asked to focus on the differences. Often it’ll be necessary to discuss the similarities, too.

'''Discuss.''' It’s very common to be given a quote or provocative statement, followed by just this word: discuss. Your answer should include an outline of the problems and then evaluate the different arguments or points of view. Weigh up the points for and against. It’s important to illustrate your argument, and refer to established work. Very often your own opinion is asked, usually in form of an evaluation of the different points of view. Look out for key debates that are involved. The statements that come with this process word are often deliberately provocative.

'''Distinguish between''' is just another process word for differentiate between.

'''Elaborate''' asks for a discussion in great detail. Always give reasons and include illustrations. Think carefully about which aspects of a theory or concept are worth exploring in great detail. In this sense, this question often asks you to—implicitly—determine the key components of something. Avoid repetitions of the same point.

'''Elucidate''' is very similar to explain. You’re asked to make clear something. This often involves a clear line of argument, and usually a number of illustrations to bring the argument alive.

'''Enumerate''' in principle asks you to put a number to something. In practice you’re normally asked to name and list different aspects, giving an explanation. You should always try to estimate the extent of something, having outlined how you reach this estimate.

'''Estimate''' is a close relative to calculate, but you’re also asked to judge and predict. State clearly how you reached your conclusion or estimate.

'''Evaluate''' is similar to discuss, but it asks you to focus more on the value or importance of a certain argument or point of view. You should weigh up the different aspects, illustrate the argument, and refer to established works. You’ll usually be able to make a statement of the worth of something. Also see the box on persuasiveness on page 22.

'''Examine''' is a process word that asks you to have a close look at something. Consider the different components and parts. Often you can examine an issue using different theoretical perspectives. Always make explicit which perspectives you use.

'''Explain''' asks you to focus on how things work. Rather than focusing on things as they are, this process word asks you to focus on how things got there. So you’ll always need to give reasons. The answer will include some describing and analyzing. It’s important to make explicit the workings and mechanisms.

'''Express''' is just another word to say describe.

'''To what extent''' is similar to assess or criticize. You’re asked to explore a statement or view. Look out for theoretical and practical limits to the statement, but also include evidence in favour. The typical conclusion highlights the limits of the proposition, but will neither be total acceptance nor total dismissal. Watch out for changes over time and across space: Is the proposition also applicable in other cultures? Was the proposition also applicable in the past?

'''Identify''' is a process word that allows you a great deal of liberty. You’re expected to choose the examples, features, or arguments for a proposition that you regard the most important ones. It’s usually a good idea to point out and list the features first. The choice of these key aspects, however, is often secondary to your answer. Instead, you should focus your attention to the criteria of evaluation: why a feature is central. You should defend and justify your choice of picks.

'''Illustrate''' is similar to explain, but the person writing the question appears to be very keen on illustrative examples. Make sure you have a relevant example, and include enough details to make clear the relevance. Sometimes, you may illustrate the argument with statistics. What is important is that the examples support the argument, and you therefore demonstrate how exactly the examples are relevant. Sometimes a question will ask you explicitly about a figure or diagram to explain or clarify. Take care to follow such instructions carefully. Where nothing is stated, assume that you should include concrete examples.

'''Indicate''' asks you to show and explain. Usually you’re expected to use a good illustration. Make sure you demonstrate how the example is relevant to the question.

'''Infer''' is a process word that asks you to conclude based on facts or a clear line of reasoning. It’s important that you state clearly how you reached the conclusion, not just what your conclusion is.

'''Interpret''' asks for a clarification and explanation. Rather than just describing, you should also give your judgement. An interpretation often highlights how an issue or point of view relates to others, or outlines the different meanings and interpretations there are to it. Usually you’re expected to give your own judgement as part of an evaluation of the different aspects.

'''Justify''' on the surface asks for a defence of a particular statement, theory, or point of view. You should cite evidence and give examples that support the case. However, for a balanced answer, it’ll be necessary to look at the arguments against. The justification thus is a form of evaluation. Your conclusion may be that the statement can’t be justified (in the light of certain evidence), or outline limits.

'''List''' probably looks as innocent as describe, and is in fact closely related. You’re asked to classify or catalogue something. Make sure you include how you decided to classify, what criteria you used to put the list in sequence. This process word may mean that you have to list the key components of a concept.

'''Mention''' asks you to describe something briefly. This process word usually is used together with others, but do make sure you don’t skip this part of the question.

'''Name''' is another word for identify.

'''Outline''' asks you to indicate what the main characteristics or features of a topic or point of view are. Sometimes you’ll need to indicate the key events in a sequence. It’s very important to follow a clear and logically coherent structure. Your answer may focus on how the different features relate to each other, rather than just describing them.

'''Prove''' is a rare process word in the social sciences. You should try to demonstrate that something is true and certain. On the one hand you should provide convincing examples and evidence that something is the case. On the other hand, you should also demonstrate that the opposite is not the case either. Your conclusion may well be that it’s impossible to prove something, but make sure your answer is relevant to the question, not just a philosophical treatment of whether we can prove things.

'''Quantify''' is another word for enumerate.

'''Relate''' is similar to giving an account of. You’re usually particularly asked to relate one thing to another, demonstrating how they link.

'''Review''' is very similar to assess. The key difference is that you’re asked to write about a topic or area rather than a specific case or statement. The answer will thus include a selection of everything about a topic. Usually it’s a bad idea trying to include all the different angles and all the different authors. Instead, you should try to organize your answer, such as into schools of thought, or key proponents. Leaving out less relevant contributions is often the key to a successful answer. Take care not merely to describe who said what, but also to assess the merit of their argument.

'''Show''' asks you to indicate something. Make sure you use appropriate evidence and examples to back up your claims. Make clear what something means.

'''Speculate''' is similar to prove, but different in that you’re not asked to come up with a definite answer. The very word used indicates that there will be many different explanations, and you’ll have to evaluate the different possibilities. You’re thus asked to form an opinion. Very often this process word is given where you don’t have complete knowledge of the circumstances. You should suggest the most likely case.

'''State''' asks you to express something carefully. Make sure you cover the different components and be clear. Often you’re asked to illustrate something, or demonstrate how two different things link.

'''Suggest''' is somewhat similar to speculate. You should mention the different possibilities, and choose the most likely one. Make sure you include in the essay the criteria how you evaluate the different possibilities: how you can say that one is the most likely possibility.

'''Summarize''' is about the identification of the key points and aspects of an issue or topic. Details can often be omitted, as can be illustrations. However, depending on the tasks, illustrations may be necessary: try to identify the key examples. This process word often occurs together with others, such as analyze. It’s often easier to first summarize and then move to the second task, but make sure the different parts of the answer link.

'''Trace''' asks you to provide a narrative that outlines the progress or sequence of an issue or certain events. Often, a chronological order is the easiest form of structure. Sometimes you’ll be asked to write from a particular point of view. Usually, however, you can include the different points of views. The same sequence of events may be interpreted or experienced in different ways by the different participants.

'''Verify''' asks you to make sure that something is the case. You’re looking for evidence and examples for and against the case. Evaluate the evidence and provide a judgment whether the statement is true or accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Defining Key Terms=

Having decided what to include in the answer, there is another way to make sure the answer is focused: telling the reader what we are talking about. By defining what the key terms mean, we do two things. Firstly, we show that we know what we are writing about. Secondly, we avoid misunderstandings by settling on a single understanding of the key terms. It might be that your marker understands power in a Marxist way, and you want to approach the essay from a feminist point of view. By providing a brief definition, there will be no misunderstanding. Your marker may not agree with you, but that is not necessary to get good grades. A definition makes sure you and your readers talk about the same things. For example, you can define fruit salad as consisting of bananas, pineapples, and yellow apples (ideally you would have a reason for this, too). Having done so, your reader will not object when you later state that fruit salad lacks the vital bits of red.

In order to define the key terms, you first have to bluntly state what they are. Always include the key words included in the question. These have been identified as central concepts for you, and by excluding them, you’ll be very likely answering a different question from the one set. There are often other key terms you want to include, and it’s usually worth spending some time thinking about which ones are the key concept. This is time worth spending, because you can later use the concepts without giving any further qualifications or comments. For this reason you should also define the terms carefully. Having defined power in a particular way, for example, every time you use the term in the essay, it only means what ''you'' want it to be.

Providing the definition of the key terms also works as a signal to your marker that you know what you’re talking about. By defining power in a certain way, you demonstrate that you’re aware of other interpretations. In fact, it’ll often not be necessary to state what the other interpretations are, unless the distinction is a key aspect of the argument. Very often, you’ll use the work of somebody else to help you define the key terms. Make sure that you put references accordingly.

The following three paragraphs define the concepts social disadvantage, social mobility, and siblings. The definitions are taken from a range of sources, and referenced accordingly. In the context of another essay, these definitions may be too long or too short.

:''Social disadvantage, to start with, refers to a range of difficulties a person can be exposed to. Social disadvantages include a lower expectancy in educational attainment, lower prospects at work, or lower status in society (McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994). It has been demonstrated that social and economic disadvantages in society often come together, leading some sociologists talking about ''underclasses'' (Steinberg, 1999). Social disadvantage, however, does not necessarily have to be as extreme as that: it describes a relative difficulty in reaching a similar position in society than people not disadvantaged.

:''Such disadvantage in society has been shown to be transmitted from one generation to another. The term ''social mobility'' is often used to describe this phenomenon (Braham &amp; Sherratt, 2002). Intergenerational mobility describes the difference between a person’s location in society as compared to his or her parents (Goldson, 2004). If social disadvantage is sustained across generations, it is often argued that in one way or another the disadvantage has been passed on.''

:''Siblings, finally, in the context of this essay, refer to brothers and sisters of the same birth family. This means that siblings are biologically related, as well as living in the same family. For consistency reasons, often siblings are chosen that live in the same family with one other sibling only. This is thought to reduce influences of effects between siblings that are not the concern in the case here (Sandefur &amp; Wells, 1999).''

Depending on the length of your essay, you’ll have between 2 and maybe 5 key terms. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to think which terms are the central ones. Consider the following phrases as ways to define terms: ''X is understood as a process by which'', ''X regards Y as'', ''one view is that there is X so that Y'', or ''X is commonly considered as''.

==Sources for Definitions==

When writing your definition, there are a number of sources you can use to help you. Using a common-sense definition is hardly ever suitable. In many cases, a definition as found in a specialist dictionary will do. In other cases, you want something even more specialized, and consult your course material. Many introductory books define key terms, and then discuss them in more detail in the chapter. It’s important not just to simply copy a definition, but choose what is suitable for your needs. Bear in mind that every text, even a specialized dictionary, was written with a specific purpose in mind. What you need for your essay is likely to be a bit different.

Google and other internet search engines may be an easy way, but they are usually not suitable. Apart from the fact that your source may not be reliable, you’re likely to end up with a definition that is either too generic, or from a different area. A definition of power from a physics text may not be what we want in our discipline.

It’s often worth spending some time on the key terms. This is the case, because the way you set out this section will direct the remainder of the essay a great deal. Choosing a certain way to interpret a concept rather than another may be just as important as focusing on certain issues and not others in the main part of the essay. Despite its importance, the section providing the definitions should not be too long: focus on the concepts that are really central. These are usually the concepts that are recurring throughout the essay.

      <comment>/* Structuring the Main Part */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Main Part=

This part constitutes the main part of your essay. Try to use about 60% of your words for this part. You can understand it as ''delivering'' what you have promised in the introduction. This part of the essay is often referred to as the main body, or the argument. It’s the part of the essay, where you develop the answer. Whilst doing so, it’s important to be aware of the question at all time. This is the only way to keep to the topic set.

Ideally, every paragraph is geared towards answering the question. It does not suffice, if you are aware of how a particular paragraph is focused on your task: you need to show the relevance to your reader. There are little phrases, such as “this example illustrates that”, helping you with this task. Consider the following example: “The resistance in Harlem insisting to keep an open market in 125th street helped to point out that there are people with different needs in the city (Zukin, 1995).” After outlining resistance in Harlem, these few sentences make it plain what the example showed us: that different people in cities have different needs.

Writing an essay can take a considerable time, but it’s important that you keep to your original plan as much as you can. Of course, new ideas will come up as you write. In this case, you should jot them down, so as not to lose them. Next, think about it: How will this help me answering the question? Is this relevant to the essay? Do I not have another example of this already? What you do is to make sure that what goes into the essay has one purpose only: answering the question. Sometimes it’s difficult to resist the temptation, but don’t explore thoughts by the way. This should not discourage you from having original ideas, or even exploring them, but it should encourage you to use your essay for one purpose only.

Keeping to the plan means keeping to the structure. This is important, because you can lose your reader by jumping around from one topic to the other, even if all you say as such is relevant and useful. By having a clear structure, and keeping to it, your reader will always know where the journey goes next. This makes your essay a pleasant read.

When writing the main part of the essay, it’s important to keep the argument and illustrations in balance. Too few examples make the essay dry and difficult. Too many, on the other hand, make the argument disappear. The trick is to include illustrations to bring the text alive, but link them tightly with the argument. Rather than stating that “this is an example of white-collar crime,” you may say “tax avoidance is a good example of white-collar crime, because…” By so doing, you demonstrate the importance of the example, you highlight how and why it is important, and most importantly, maybe, you avoid that the examples take over. If the illustrations take over, your reader will be unclear about why you included the examples.

==Sections==
Sections are an important tool to structure the answer of an essay. The longer the answer, the more important sections probably are. Some courses and tutors may ask you to include subheadings (as used in this book); some institutions even have explicit recommendations on their use. Subheadings can be a good way to structure an answer into sections. However, the lack of subheadings—or the fact that your tutor discourages you from using them—is no excuse for not having sections.

Sections group paragraphs that elaborate a similar point. Often, within a section, you’ll have a number of paragraphs discussing the same issue from a number of different perspectives. A section can be treated, in some ways, as if it was a mini essay in itself. This is the case, because in each section, a particular point is explored. For example, there might be a section on the arguments for abortion, and then a section on the arguments against.

What is important when writing a section, is that both you and the reader are aware of the purpose of the section. It’s tiring and frustrating for your reader to read half a page before knowing what you’re writing about, or more often why you’re writing this here. For these reasons it’s important to link the sections into a coherent one. By linking the sections, and linking the paragraphs within each section, your essay will be more focused on answering the question.

For example, after a paragraph outlining problems of studying and measuring the transmission of social disadvantage, in one of my essays I discussed how sibling data may be the solution. I opened the paragraph as follows: “The use of sibling data promises a cure to at least some of the problems outlined above.” In one sentence, the new topic (sibling data) is introduced, but it is also indicated why this may be important (because these data help tackling the problems already outlined). The reader should not be puzzled as to what the link is between problems of measuring the transmission of social disadvantage on the one hand, and sibling data on the other.

Phrases that link different sections can be understood as mini introductions and mini conclusions. Particularly when a section is long, or where the link to the next section is not immediately apparent, it might be useful to write one or two sentences to summarize the section. This will indicate to the reader how far we have come in developing the argument, but also remind him or her, why we have bothered to write a section in the first place.

===Useful Phrases===
This box contains a selection of useful phrases you can use in your essays. You can use these words and phrases to connect the different bits and pieces of your text into a coherent whole. The following list is intended to give you an idea of all the phrases that are available to you.

'''Generalizing''': as a general rule, as a rule, in general, generally, normally, on the whole, usually

'''Explaining''': in other words, that is, this means that

'''Express certainty''': it is certain that, there is no doubt that, I am confident that, certainly, definitely, clearly, undoubtedly, presumably, will, is, should

'''Express probability''': it is probable that, it is likely that, probably

'''Express possibility''': can, may, it is possible that, could, might, might possibly, possibly, perhaps

Just like sections are structured into paragraphs, each paragraph should have some internal logic. You can usually use the first sentence of a paragraph to introduce what the paragraph is about. This is particularly useful at the beginning of a new section. Consider these phrases as bridges. For example, in one of my essays, I opened a paragraph with “It will now be necessary to consider the argument that local cultures are dominated by transnational corporations.” My readers will immediately know what the paragraph is about.

Ideally, every single sentence is geared towards answering the question. Practically, this is hard to achieve, given the lack of infinite time resources available to most of us. However, by your trying to link similar paragraphs into sections, and by linking sections into a wider argument, every essay will benefit. The result is an essay that is easier and more pleasant to read.

Each paragraph, and definitely each section, should be geared towards the essay question you’re answering. It’s therefore a good idea to evaluate each section in terms of how far this helped to answer the essay question. You do a number of things with this: demonstrate that you’re still on track; you’re working towards a conclusion; you demonstrate the relevance of what you wrote in the section. If you can’t state how a particular paragraph or section is relevant towards your answer, then probably it is not.

==Structuring the Main Part==
There are different ways to structure the main part of the essay. One key difference is between essays structured along the lines of analytic dimensions, and those structured along the lines of argumentative dimensions. For example, the analytic dimensions of an essay on globalization may be ''economic aspects'', ''cultural aspects'', or ''political aspects''. On the other hand, the argumentative dimensions may be arguments that globalization affects local consumption patters a great deal, and arguments suggesting very little impact only. The analytic approach would examine the different views in terms of economic aspects first, before moving on to cultural aspects. The argumentative approach would first explore the views in favour of strong impacts in all the different dimensions: economic, cultural, political, and then move on to do the same for arguments against.

There is no fast rule which of these approaches is better. In fact, both approaches can be very successful. You should consider the extent to which your structure helps you avoid saying the same thing twice. Whatever approach you choose, a clear indication in the introduction as to how you approach the essay will make sure your reader knows where you’re going.

==Dealing with Repetition==

An essay where the same word or sentence structure is repeated time and time again is often boring. Many writers consider repetitions bad writing. There are a few things you can do to avoid repetition. Where you should be careful, however, is the use of specialist terms. For the reasons outlined in the section on defining terms, you should never substitute a specific term with a more generic one. If you talk about power, then say so, even if this means using the same word over and over again. By no means use a thesaurus and pick a random suggestion offered there. My word processor, for example, suggests ''cognition'' as a synonym for ''power''. This may be the case in some contexts, but as a key term, this is hardly ever the case.

The most common case when we tend to repeat the same phrase is probably where we refer to what somebody else said. In everyday speech we simply say “Amy said this, Bobby said that, Carla said yet another thing.” In the more formal style required in essay writing, this is commonly written in the following way: “Adams (2006) states that…, Bird (1999) suggests that.”

In order to make your essay less repetitive, consider the following options in addition to the common states and suggests. Always use your own judgement, when a phrase feels overused. By suggesting that repetition may leave a less than ideal impression, it’s not argued that this is an area of essay writing worth spending hours on. It’s much better being repetitive, but being precise and making a good argument.

* Crouch (1977) argues that …
* Daniels (2004) sees the problem as resulting from …
* Elton (1848) identifies the problem as consisting of …
* Ferro (1997) is of the opinion that …
* Gallagher (2003) defends the view that …
* Hall (1998) notes that the problem originates from …
* Inglehart (2000) considers that …
* Jackson (1984) views the issue as caused by …
* Kanter (1970) maintains that …
* Lewis (2002) concurs with Mann (2000) that …
* Nixon (1955) supports the view that …
* Orwell (1999) holds the view that …
* Perry (2005) agrees that …
* Quart (2001) denies that …

These alternative ways to put the ever same idea may be particularly useful when reviewing what different authors had to say on an issue—the parts of the essay where you simply restate what has been said before. Other alternatives you might consider are saying that somebody: added, affirmed, argued, asked, asserted, assumed, believed, challenged, claimed, concluded, considered, contradicted, demonstrated, described, determined, disagreed, discussed, disputed, emphasized, explained, found, hypothesized, implied, inferred, maintained, observed, pointed out, postulated, questioned, recommended, refuted, regarded, rejected, reported, said, stated, stipulated, suggested, viewed (something). This list should illustrate that there need be no conflict between variation in writing and writing clearly. If in doubt, however, you should always prioritize clarity.

==Academic Style==

When writing for academic purposes, there are a number of conventions that you should follow. A key difference to most other forms of writing is that we give references to the sources of our argument. Ambiguity is something most academics dislike, and you’re more credible, too, if you avoid it. Academic writing tends to be rather formal, and many will advise you to avoid writing in the first person (that is, not write using I). This makes academic writing both formal and impersonal.

The reason why the first person should be avoided, is that in scientific writing one’s opinions, feelings and views are not regarded as important. Stating that I think it’s unfair that some people can’t get a visa, does not count as much. However, urging you not to use I in essays can fail in two ways. Firstly, you could still write about your own feelings and opinions using different phrases, and secondly, not all uses of the first person are bad. It’s a good idea to stay clear of phrases such as “I think,” or “in my opinion,” unless you’re evaluating a claim. However, there is no apparent reason for not saying “I will first define the key terms.” Using the first person in this way will make a text more approachable. Moreover, using phrases starting with I, you avoid using the passive voice which many find more difficult to read.

Having said this, some markers still consider it preferable not to use the first person. Should your tutor or marker be one of them, you may want to play it safe. Don’t use we when you mean ''I''. If you are the sole author, the use of a plural is technically not correct. However, even a tutor who hates such phrases will not mark you down: It’s the argument and general structure of your essay that count for much more.

One area where there is no room for argument is the use of colloquialisms, slang, or street language. Academic writing is formal writing, and you might be penalized for using the wrong register. A little bit of informality here or there will not normally matter much. Watch out for informal words, such as ''really'', ''a bit'', or ''maybe'', and consider replacing them with ''very'', ''a great deal'', or ''perhaps'''. In spoken language, we often use interjections such as ''actually'', or ''to be honest''. These, too, don’t belong into an academic essay.

Consider the following example: “To be honest, I don’t think much of this theory” is something we might say to a colleague of ours. When writing an essay, you could put this as: “It is clear from the evidence presented in this essay that the applications of this theory are limited.” The following list further illustrates what is meant by formal and informal English. The formal words are included in brackets in each case: Ask for (request), carry out (conduct), chance (opportunity), find out (discover), get better (improve), get worse (deteriorate), guess (estimate), look into (investigate), OK (satisfactory), tell (inform), worried (concerned).

Euphemisms, such as ''passed away'' for ''die'', are another aspect of language you should not use in your essays: if you write about and mean ''die'', then say so. Clarity and accuracy are paramount. For these reasons academic writing can be rather tentative and cautious. This is the case because we are not after grabbing headlines, but we write accurately what we know. If our data suggest that X ''possibly leads to'' Y, we say just that. In this case we should never say that X ''leads to'' Y. In academia we are often unsure what really goes on, and we should be upfront about this.

Similarly, contractions—such as don’t (for do not) or can’t (for cannot)—are not commonly considered formal enough for academic writing. Some of your readers will consider this convention ridiculous; others take it as a sign that you have not understood you should write in a scholarly fashion. To play it safe, use the full forms at any time. This particular academic convention seems to ease more and more.

Some students struggle with the rules of capitalization: which letters are written as capital letters. The easiest one is that every sentence starts with a capital letter. Names and titles (called proper nouns) are also written with capital letters, unless there is a specific reason not to. So, we write the name of ''Mark Granovetter'' with capital letters, but the special case of the ''iPod'' is written with a small one. Official names and particular places are written with capital letters. It’s thus the ''Department of Health'', and ''Oxford University''. However, when we write about general places, we don’t use capital letters. We study at university in general. Official titles are often capitalized, such as ''Value Added Tax''. Furthermore, many abbreviations come with capital letters. It’s an ''MBA'' your friend may be studying for. The days of the week are capitalized, such as in ''Monday'' and ''Wednesday'', as are the names of the months. The names of countries, nationalities, languages, and people from places are written with capital letters: the ''Swiss'' live in ''Switzerland'', and ''Norway'' is a country. Apart from this, about every other word is written with small letters.

===Weasel Terms===

Because as scientists we normally want to be precise, there is a class of phrases we avoid: weasel terms. Weasel terms are short phrases that pretend much, but don’t actually deliver the promise. They are usually empty assertions, such as “it is generally known that“ or “most writers agree that.”

This box contains a list of weasel terms. In an essay, you should never use these phrases without a reference to substantiate what is said. 

* allegedly
* arguably
* as opposed to most
* considered by many
* contrary to many
* critics say that
* experts say that
* it could be argued that
* it has been noticed
* it has been said
* it has been stated
* it has been suggested
* it is generally claimed
* it is widely believed that
* mainstream scholars say that
* mainstream scientists say that
* many people say
* many scientists argue that
* research has shown
* researchers argue that
* serious scholars say that
* social science says
* sociologists believe that
* some argue
* some feel that
* some historians argue
* the scientific community
* this is widely considered to be
* this is widely regarded as
* widely considered as

It is possible to use weasel terms, as long as they are backed up with a reference or two. So, saying that something is “widely considered the foremost example of” something is possible, if you either provide a reference to someone who demonstrates this, or provide a group of references to back up your claim. However, in most cases we want to be more precise. Rather than saying that “many social scientists argue that class is important”—which is probably true—and giving a couple of references to back this up, it’s better to put it as follows: “Goldthorpe (2000) argues that class remains important.” Or maybe we have access to a statistic we can cite, that X% of social scientists seem to consider class important. In either case, the solution is more precise and thus more satisfactory.

The use of references is an academic convention, and you must follow this, even though it might be a tiresome exercise. Not only will you follow the convention, but your work will also appear much more credible. You can find more on the [[Writing_Better_University_Essays/Referencing|use of references]] in a separate section.

Footnotes are often associated with academic writing. Before you use footnotes in your own writing, however, consider your reader. Footnotes interrupt the flow of reading: you force your audience to stop for a while, moving down to the bottom of the page, before they can read on. From the reader’s point of view you should avoid footnotes if you can. The only general exception is if you use footnotes for referencing. Don’t use endnotes (footnotes at the end of the text), unless they are used exclusively for referencing. Asking your reader to flick forth and back through your essay is even more of an interruption. Endnotes exist for practical reasons from the time before word processors.

Footnotes are used to explain obscure words, or when you want to add some special information. In the case of obscure words, if it’s a key term, define it in the main text. There are cases, where you’ll want to use an obscure word, but it is not central to the argument. Consider the following example: “The Deputy must, with every word he speaks in the Diet&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, […] anticipate himself under the scrutiny of his constituents” (Rousseau, 1762, cited in Putterman, 2003, p.465). Here I talk about the name of an assembly. The word is probably obscure to most readers, but not central to my argument: I write about parliaments in general, not the ''Diet'' in particular. Adding this footnote will help the readers to understand the quote. In terms of special information, if you make an important point, then make in the main text. If it’s an unimportant remark, then very often you don’t want to make it at all. The guiding principle is whether the note is relevant to your answer.

Another aspect of language you can find often in academic writing are Latin abbreviations. Never use these unless you’re sure what they mean. Normally, you should not use abbreviations in the main text. Instead, use plain English. Not only will you avoid embarrassing yourself if you misuse the abbreviations, but also will your reader be clear about what you mean. It’s much clearer to write for example, rather than mistakenly putting i.e. instead of e.g. (a common mistake). Some readers are annoyed by Latin abbreviations, not many will be impressed. Others will simply struggle to understand without a look in the dictionary. The same is true for a number of English abbreviations.

Another area of academic writing where there are many bad examples out there is the use of jargon and specialist terms. Whilst we aim for clarity and accuracy, jargon is never justified where it does not help these purposes. Specialist terms can be very useful to summarize complex issues into a few letters. Nonetheless, all technical terms need to be defined in simpler language somewhere in your essay. Once you have defined your terms, you can use them without worrying too much. This is where the ''define'' section comes in. Bear in mind what your audience is likely to know.

Other aspects of writing that may make your essay easier to read, and thus more approachable are: the use of shorter words where possible, cutting out words where they are redundant, using the active voice (''I do'', ''she says'', rather than ''it is understood'', ''it is achieved''), and using English words where they are not different from the Latin or Greek ones. We want to write as clearly as we can, because when the writing is not clear, very often this is an indication that the argument is not very clear, either.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Discussion=
After presenting the main argument, it’s usually necessary to discuss what this all means. The argument of the essay may have implications on policy, implications on the use of certain theories, or implications on how we (should) understand the world. Not always are these implications novel or big. Nevertheless, you should always discuss the implications of what you have just said. If you don’t do so, you risk leaving your reader with the feeling of ''so what''?

Obviously, this is something we want to avoid. The discussion of what it all means can often be incorporated inside the main section of the essay. This is often a good idea, too, because the repetition of the same points can be avoided. However, even where the implications of the argument are discussed as part of the main argument, it’s a good idea to use at least one paragraph to make explicit that you have invested time into this section.

Rather than summarizing the argument, this section is here to draw the different sections together. Depending on the essay question, the discussion can be rather large (such as in an ''evaluate'' question), or very short (for example if you’re asked to ''describe'' something).

==Evaluating Persuasiveness==
A number of essay questions directly or indirectly ask you to evaluate the persuasiveness of an argument or theory. There are a number of points you can look out for when making such an evaluation: coherence, empirical adequacy, and comprehensiveness.

A good approach is to think about the coherence of the argument, the empirical adequacy, and the comprehensiveness. By ''coherence'' I refer to the reasoning and the argument. Does it make sense? Is the argument elaborate enough? Are there gaps in the line of reasoning? Is the argument clear? Does one point follow the other? Is it a logical argument?

''Empirical adequacy'' is about the extent to which there is support for the argument. Does the evidence support the argument? Does A always lead to B? Are there alternative explanations?

''Comprehensiveness'', finally, is about the limits of the argument. Is it true in other places? Was it true in the past? Will it be the same in the future? Do other cultures do things the same way? Is the argument explicit about its limits? Does the argument attempt to cover everything (universal)?

Thinking about these three aspects alone will help evaluate arguments and claims. You’ll find that sometimes the answers to the questions here are difficult to answer. Sometimes, the answers lie in the assumptions, or in what is not said.

Where you’re asked to evaluate the usefulness of ''models'' or ''terms'', consider the following criteria. You should not just state that X is being used, but always try to establish criteria for the usefulness of the model.

For definitions, look out how clearly something can be defined. Can we recognize an X if we see one? Are all X the same? Is X a neutral term? Is X value-laden? Does the definition of X depend on something else? Is X the same in every context? How can X be measured?

You may also want to consider the analytic dimensions of concepts. Is X as a concept more useful than Y? Does X contradict Y? Is X complimentary to Y? In which cases is using X rather than Y more useful? What does X capture better than other terms? What does X capture that other terms don’t? But also, what does X ''not'' capture?

There is often also a normative dimension to terms (what should be). A full evaluation will include such normative aspects, too. What does X suggest about policies? Given X, how should society be organized? How should the world be seen?

      <comment>/* When to Write the Conclusion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Conclusion=

Having written the essay, you state that you have done so. This section is often separated visually, or singled out with a subheading such as ''conclusion'' or ''concluding remarks''. What this section does, is summarizing what you have done, and providing a conclusion to the argument. Never should you bring in new material—be it examples or arguments—at this stage.

In fact, your aim is to make the conclusion as short as you can. If there is much to discuss, if there are many loose ends, you should use the previous section (''discussion'') to do so. In a similar way as the introduction includes an outline, the conclusion recaps the argument. What you do is to revisit the highlights of the argument. Just like the discussion leads to a conclusion, your final section will close with a concluding remark.

The following is an example of a concluding paragraph. Depending on the length of your essay, it might be reasonable to have a longer conclusion, but try to keep it as short as you can.

:''This paper has critically looked at an article by Katz-Gerro on cultural consumption (2002). The article was outlined, and particular attention was given to the research design, data analysis, and the persuasiveness of the argument. It was found that the article provides a coherent and plausible argument, but one which is marred by issues around the comparability of the data used, as well as the omission of some compelling alternative explanatory variables, such as status. Because of these weak points, the findings of the article may not be as generalizable as the author presents them. The article uses a good approach, but the study could have been executed in a more rigorous way, a point that would have improved the power of the argument.''

This example illustrates the two functions: summarizing, and concluding. The first bit reminds the reader how we got where we are. Then the key points of the argument are briefly revisited. Finally, the paragraph and the essay are brought to a conclusion. Nothing new is added, and no time and space is wasted reiterating what was said before. Obviously, without a substantial section discussing the different strengths and weaknesses of the article, as well as the significance of those, the conclusion could never be so short.

Writing a long conclusion means that—for the last time—you run the risk of losing your reader. Reading the same thing again, albeit put in different words, is not usually very interesting to read. By keeping the discussion separate, the final paragraph can be short and to the point.

It’s important to note that you can take sides in an essay, and indeed you should. It’s unlikely that you’ll ever conclude that something is utterly useless or the golden bullet for that, but if your argument suggests that the statement you were given, for example, does not hold, then do say so. A good idea to conclude an essay is by referring back to the original question. This can be done in a subtle way, but often there is nothing lost from doing it head on. By so doing, you demonstrate that even after all the work, you’re still focused.

==When to Write the Conclusion==

Just as there is disagreement on when it is best to write the introduction, there is no clear consensus when to write the conclusion. On the one hand, you can write it at the end, after you know where the essay leads. On the other hand, you can write it first, and thus commit yourself to the conclusion. The idea is to force yourself to stay focused.

Unfortunately, writing the conclusion first is no guarantee of staying focused. Although I would recommend writing the conclusion last, because that's one way to get the greatest effect possible (and for that, you need to know exactly how your argument went), it’s not unreasonable to write the conclusion first. In this case, do so as an incentive to stay focused, but be prepared to modify the conclusion after you have finished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Young.gif|right]]
You should be familiar with the idea that, when light passes through a slit, it is diffracted (caused to spread out in arcs from the slit). The amount of diffraction increases the closer the slit width is to the wavelength of the light. Consider the animation on the right. Light from a light source is caused to pass through two slits. It is diffracted at both these slits, and so it spreads out in two sets of arcs.

Now, apply superposition of waves to this situation. At certain points, the peaks (or troughs) of the waves will coincide, creating constructive interference. If this occurs on a screen, then a bright 'fringe' will be visible. On the other hand, if destructive interference occurs (a peak coincides with a trough), then no light will be visible at that point on the screen.

==Calculating the angles at which fringes occur==

If we wish to calculate the position of a bright fringe, we know that, at this point, the waves must be in phase. Alternatively, at a dark fringe, the waves must be in antiphase. If we let the wavelength equal λ, the angle of the beams from the normal equal θ, and the distance between the slits equal d, we can form two triangles, one for bright fringes, and another for dark fringes (the crosses labelled 1 and 2 are the slits):

[[Image:Youngs_slits.png]]

The length of the side labelled λ is known as the path difference. For bright fringes, from the geometry above, we know that:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{\lambda}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

However, bright fringes do not only occur when the side labelled λ is equal to 1 wavelength: it can equal multiple wavelengths, so long as it is a whole wavelength. Therefore

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where n is any integer.

Now consider the right-hand triangle, which applies to dark fringes. We know that, in this case:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{0.5\lambda}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0.5\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can generalise this, too, for any dark fringe. However, if 0.5λ is multiplied by an even integer, then we will get a whole wavelength, which would result in a bright, not a dark, fringe. So, n must be an odd integer in the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;0.5n\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = 2d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculating the distances angles correspond to on the screen==

At this point, we have to engage in some slightly dodgy maths. In the following diagram, p is path difference, L is the distance from the slits to the screen and x is the perpendicular distance from a fringe to the normal:

[[Image:Youngs_slits_effect.png]]

Here, it is necessary to approximate the distance from the slits to the fringe as the perpendicular distance from the slits to the screen. This is acceptable, provided that θ is small, which it will be, since bright fringes get dimmer as they get further away from the point on the screen opposite the slits. Hence:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{x}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute this into the equation for the path difference p:

&lt;math&gt;p = d \sin{\theta} = \frac{dx}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

So, at bright fringes:

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = \frac{dx}{L}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an integer.

And at dark fringes:

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = \frac{2dx}{L}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an odd integer.

==Diffraction Grating==

A diffraction grating consists of a lot of slits with equal values of d. As with 2 slits, when &lt;math&gt;n\lambda = d \sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, peaks or troughs from all the slits coincide and you get a bright fringe. Things get a bit more complicated, as all the slits have different positions at which they add up, but you only need to know that diffraction gratings form light and dark fringes, and that the equations are the same as for 2 slits for these fringes.

==Questions==

1. A 2-slit experiment is set up in which the slits are 0.03 m apart. A bright fringe is observed at an angle 10° from the normal. What sort of electromagnetic radiation was being used?

2. Light, with a wavelength of 500 nm, is shone through 2 slits, which are 0.05 m apart. What are the angles to the normal of the first three dark fringes?

3. Some X-rays, with wavelength 1 nm, are shone through a diffraction grating in which the slits are 50 μm apart. A screen is placed 1.5m from the grating. How far are the first three light fringes from the point at which the normal intercepts the screen?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Referencing=

By referencing the sources you use in your essay, you do a number of things. First of all, you comply with an academic convention. Secondly, you make your essay look more professional. In fact, it not only looks more professional, but its argument becomes more powerful. Thirdly, you allow others to check your sources. This is often only a hypothetical issue, but a look through the list of your references will allow others to judge your argument quickly. Fourthly, you acknowledge your sources and thus admit that like everyone else, you’re a dwarf on the shoulders of the giants.

The essential bits of referencing require you to provide enough information to others so that they can identify the source. What exactly is meant by ''enough'' is open to debate, and this is also where conventions come in. Essential is that you do provide references. Ideally, you would do so properly. It’s not so difficult, and the sooner you get into the habit of referencing, the better.

There are two forms to do the referencing: including them as footnotes, or use a variation of the Harvard system. Your institution may have a preference, or even a house style. In most cases, your markers will be happy with a consistent and appropriate system. The Harvard system is also known as author/date, and will be described here in more detail.

==Inside the Text==

Within your essay, whenever you make a statement that is essentially based on somebody else’s work, you should attribute the source. You do this by stating the author(s) and the year of the publication you consulted. Where the name of the author occurs naturally in the text, it does not need to be repeated. The references are usually included at the end of a sentence, or where inappropriate in a place where the text flow is not interrupted too much, such as in front of a comma. This may be necessary, for example, if only the first half of your sentence is based on someone else’s work.

:''Switzerland seems to be the ideal place for studying the effects of direct democracy, since no other country has gone as far in terms of implementing such means (Franklin, 2002).''

The name of the author is included in brackets, together with the year of publication. Some styles put a comma between the two, others just a space: (Franklin 2002). Where there are two authors, both names are included: (McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994). Some styles prefer the word ''and'', others prefer the ampersand (&amp; symbol). Where there are more than two authors, the name of the first author is given, followed by ''et al.'' (which literally means ''and others''): (Almeder ''et al.'', 2001). Some styles put ''et al.'' into italics, others don’t.

If you have two or more references for the same argument, you should separate the references with a semicolon (; symbol): (McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994; Steinberg, 1999). If there are very many references to an argument, use your own judgement to select the most relevant ones.

What should you reference? Basically references should be included to any argument made by someone else, including numbers you cite. However, statements of general nature need not be attributed to anyone. A statement that the sky is blue alone does not require a reference. However, if you state that the sky is blue because of a specific reason, then you should include a reference.
If you use the exact words of an author (quotation), you’ll need to give the number of the page where you copy from. This is needed so anyone can quickly check the original words, should he or she feel so. See the separate section on quotes.

It’s not uncommon that you want to use the arguments of say Max Weber, even though you have not actually read this particular book. Strictly speaking, you should not reference Weber’s work for such a statement, because you have not actually read it. Can you really be sure this is what Weber said or meant? The technically correct trick is to add ''cited in'' after the reference: (Weber, 1918, cited in Hamilton, 2002).

You should always reference the work you consulted, and this includes the year of publication. Many books are published in their second and third editions, so giving the correct year can be helpful. Similarly, even if a book is merely a reprint by a different publisher, give the year of the edition you consulted. The page numbers may differ. If it’s just a second print of the exact same book, use the original date. Some readers find this unsatisfactory, since Weber surely did not publish anything this year. The convention to circumvent this issue is to give both years: the year of the original publication, together with the one of the work you consulted. Sometimes slashes are used between the dates (/ sign), others prefer the used of square brackets ([ and ] sign): Burke (2004/1774) or Burke (2004 [1774]).

Another small issue occurs where an author published more than one book or article in a single year, and you want to cite more than one of them. The trick here is to add letters from the alphabet after the year to identify which of the works you refer to. Use the letter ''a'' for the first of your references, the letter ''b'' for the second and so on: (McManus, 1994a) and (McManus, 1994b) are two different works.

To sum it up, inside the text, you give the family name of the author, followed by the year of the publication. Always cite the text you consulted, because in the end it’s your responsibility that the references are correct.

==At the End==

At the end of your essay you should include a list of references. Such a list of references provides more details than just the name of the author and the year of publication. It’s this list that allows identifying the work cited. Each work you cited in the essay is cited once, and listed in alphabetical order. Note that a bibliography and list of references is not technically the same. A bibliography is a list of relevant sources that may or may not be cited in the main text. References are the sources you cited, even if they are rather trivial. Use the heading ''references'' for your references.

For books, you put the family name of the author(s) and their initials, followed by the year of publication in brackets, the title in italics, the place of publication, and finally the name of the publisher. If there are editors, give their names instead of the authors’. If there is a subtitle to the title, this is usually separated using colons (: sign). Where there are more than four authors, it’s common to use ''et al.'' after the first three, but some styles insist on citing all authors. Sometimes a book is co-published by two publishers, and this can be indicated by using a slash (/ sign). Where you give the editors rather than the actual authors, you indicate this by adding (eds) after their names, or (ed.) if there is only one. The title is capitalized. For example:

: Anderson, C. &amp; Zelle, C. (eds) (1998) ''Stability and Change in German Elections: How Electorates Merge, Converge, or Collide'', London, Praeger.
: Granovetter, M. (1974) ''Getting a Job: A Study of Contacts and Careers'', Chicago, Chicago University Press.
: Grass, G. (1963) ''Katz und Maus'', Neuwied am Rhein, Rowolth/Hermann Leuchterhand.
: Hall, S. (ed.) (1997) ''Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices'', London, Sage.
: Halsey, A., Heath, A. &amp; Ridge, J. (1980) ''Origins and Destinations'', Oxford, Clarendon Press.

Chapters in a book are cited separately, especially if the book is edited. You give the family name of the author and his or her initial, the year, the name of the chapter in single speech marks (‘ and ’ sign; not capitalized), followed by the word ''in'', and the name and year of the editor(s). If you cite only one chapter, you can give the whole reference at the end; otherwise it’s enough to give the name and year of the editor. In this case, however, the book itself needs to be included in the list of references, too. For example:

: Allen, J. (1995) ‘Global worlds’ in Allen, J. &amp; Massey, D. (eds) (1995).
: Hardin, R. (1990) ‘Public choice versus democracy’ in Chapman, J. &amp; Wertheimer, A. (eds) (1990).
: Leroy, P. &amp; Verhagen, K. (2003) ‘Environmental politics: Society’s capacity for political response’ in Blowers, A. &amp; Hinchliffe, S. (eds) (2003) ''Environmental Responses'', Chichester, Wiley.

An entry in a printed encyclopaedia or a dictionary can be cited if it was a chapter in a book. The editors are often given on the front of the reference book. For example:

: Jackman, R. (2001) ‘Social capital’ in Smelser, N. &amp; Baltes, P. (eds) (2004).

Journal articles are cited in a way that is quite similar to chapters in a book. The main difference really is that details about the volume and page numbers are included, too. The reference starts with the name and initial of the author, the year in brackets, the title of the article in single speech marks (not capitalized), followed by the name of the journal in italics (capitalized), and further details. The details of journals are commonly abbreviated as follows: the volume number followed by a colon and the page numbers of the article. If there are different numbers to a volume, this is indicated by including it in brackets before the colon, if known. Online journals may not have page numbers. For example:

: Burt, R. (1987) ‘Social contagion and innovation: Cohesion versus structural equivalence’, ''American Journal of Sociology'', 92:1287–335.
: Thoits, P. &amp; Hewitt, L. (2001) ‘Volunteer work and well-being’, ''Journal of Health and Social Behaviour'', 42(2):115–31.
: Small, C. (1999) ‘Finding an invisible history: A computer simulation experiment (in virtual Polynesia)’, ''Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation'', 2(3).
: Valente, T. (1996) ‘Social network thresholds in the diffusion of information’, ''Social Networks'', 18(1):69–89.

Pages on the internet should be cited where used. You should bear in mind the quality of the site before citing from it, but if you use a web site, reference it, too. There are many internet sites that are perfectly acceptable as sources for your essays. The reference includes the name of the author and initial, the year in brackets, the title of the document in italics, the word ''online'' in square brackets, the place of publication, the publisher, the words ''available from'': followed by the URL, and the date when the document was accessed in brackets. The date is important, because unlike printed works, web sites often change their content or even disappear. Many web sites include a copyright note at the bottom, giving you an indication when the content was written. For example:

:Moser, P. (2005) ''Politik im Kanton Zürich—eine Synthese'' [online], Zürich, Statistisches Amt des Kantons Zürich, available from: http://www.statistik.zh.ch/statistik.info/pdf/2005_15.pdf [accessed 27th October 2005].
: Chan, T. &amp; Goldthorpe, J. (2004) ''Social Status and Newspaper Readership'' [online], Oxford, Oxford University, available from: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/news4.pdf [accessed 31st March 2005].

Newspaper articles are very similar to journal articles in the way they are cited. The key difference is that rather than the volume, the date is given. The reference therefore includes the name and initial of the author, the year of publication in brackets, the title in single speech marks, the name of the newspaper in italics (capitalized), the date, and finally the page where the article was found. For one page it’s customary to use the abbreviation ''p.'', for articles running over two or more pages, the abbreviation pp. is common. For example:

: Cockburn, P. &amp; Usborne, D. (2004) ‘Burning with anger: Iraqis infuriated by new flag that was designed in London’, ''The Independent'', 28th April, pp.2–3.

Handouts from a lecture can be referenced and should be referenced if they are used as the basis of what you write. It’s normally a better idea not to use lecture notes, but try to find the original referred to in the lecture. Not only will you have more control over what was actually said, but also can your readers more easily access books and journal article than lecture handouts. The reference to a lecture handout includes the name and initial of the lecturer, the year in bracket, the title of the handout in single speech marks, the words lecture notes distributed in followed by the name of the course in italics, the word at and the name of your institution, the place, and date of the lecture. For example:

: Burt, S. (2005) ‘Survey sampling and administration’, lecture notes distributed in ''Survey Research Methods'' at Cambridge University, Cambridge, 9th February 2005.

Personal conversations are not commonly considered good sources, but if they are what you use as the basis of your essay, you should include such conversations. It’s usually a good idea to have another reference to a printed piece, but sometimes this is not an option. In terms of giving the reference, personal conversations are very easy: the name of the person you spoke to, the year in brackets, the words ''conversation with the author'' and the date of the conversation. For example:

: Smith, E. (2004) conversation with the author 6th July 2004.

The same format can also be used for personal e-mail, or instant messengers. Once again, bear in mind the credibility of your sources. With e-mail messages it’s customary to include the e-mail address of the sender in brackets after the name, but it’s essential that you obtain consent from the author. The subject line of the e-mail is often included as the title. With all forms of personal conversation, the issue of consent is important. It’s always a ''very'' good idea to check with the author first.

==Problem Cases==

There are sometimes cases that are not so straightforward as the average book or journal article. For everything there is a solution in the academic conventions. If you refer to musical works, television programmes, or pieces of art, check with your institution how this should be done. If everything else fails, remember the function of referencing, and provide a reasonable amount of information for others to chase the work.
Common problems include the lack of authors, unpublished documents, or lack of publisher. Where there is no author, often there is an organization. Put the name of the organization. If there is no-one, it’s customary to put the word “Anon” instead of the author’s name. For example:

: IDEA (1998) ''Women in Parliament: Beyond Numbers'' [online], Stockholm, International IDEA, available from: http://archive.idea.int/women/parl/toc.htm [accessed 28th February 2006].

: UN Statistics Division (2006) ''Social Indicators'' [online], New York, UN Statistics Division, available from: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/socind/inc-eco.htm [accessed 20th February 2006].

Sometimes the year of a document is not known. Where you have a rough idea, you can put a c before the date, such as in (c.1999). Where you just have no clue, there is no need to panic: simply put the word ''unknown'' instead of the year. Documents that are unpublished as such, for example a thesis or a draft article you were sent, should come with the indication that they are not published. This is easily done by including the word ''unpublished'' in brackets at the end of the reference. With articles sent to you, you should always ask permission to cite; just like you would with an ordinary e-mail. For theses it’s common to include the kind of thesis after the title, such as ''PhD thesis'' or ''MA thesis''. Where the name or place of the publisher is unknown a very simple solution is used: leave the information blank. This is particularly an issue with internet sites. Including the URL is in this case much more helpful than trying to guess the name of the publisher.

Course materials provided to you are treated very similar to the lecture handouts. Give the name of the author, the year in brackets, the course code if there is one, the course title in italics (capitalized), the kind of material and its title in single speech marks, place of publication, and publisher. For example:

: Peake, S. (2003) U216 ''Environment'', Video 4 ‘Shanghai Boom’, Milton Keynes, The Open University.
: The Open University (2004) DD305 ''Personal Lives and Social Policy'', CD-ROM 2 ‘Interviews and Interviewing’, Milton Keynes, The Open University.

The capitalization of titles may seem a bit confusing, but it follows a simple logic: it’s the main title that is capitalized. In the case of a book, the main title is that of the book. In the case of journal articles, on the other hand, the main title is thought to be that of the journal itself. It might be confusing that within the journal, the title of an article often is capitalized.

Capitalization is not very hard to achieve. Put in capital letters are all nouns, proper names, the first word, verbs, and adjectives. This is in fact almost everything. Not put in capital letters are words like ''and'', ''in'', ''or'', or ''with''. Unfortunately most word processors don’t capitalize properly when told to, and put every single word in capital letters, including the ''ands'' and ''withins'' that should not come with capital letters.

Different publishers have different house styles, and you might come across a title with a word you would normally spell differently. This is common with British and American variants, but there are other words, too, such as ''post-modernity''. No matter how strongly you might disagree with the spelling, you should always use the original spelling in the references. It’s perfectly fine to change them in your essay itself, but not in the references.

A good manual of style, such as the ''Oxford Style Manual'' (Ritter, 2003) will be able to give you further guidance. Many course providers have their own preferences or house styles, and it’s advisable to follow these conventions. Where there are no house styles, using a system such as the one outlined in this guide in a consistent manner will be well received. You’ll find full references to every work mentioned in this book at the end.

==Plagiarism==

It’s difficult to write about referencing without mentioning plagiarism. Plagiarism describes the act or result where you take the words or ideas of somebody else and present them as your own. Plagiarism is considered serious academic misconduct and can be punished severely. Most importantly, however, your reputation is on the line.

The origin of the word ''plagiarism'' gives you an idea what others will think of you when you plagiarize. The word goes back to the Latin ''plagiārius'', a thief and kidnapper—in particular a child snatcher and somebody abducting slaves. The modern use in academia brands you a ''literary thief'' (OED, 2005).

There are a number of reasons why plagiarism occurs. The worst case is deliberate plagiarism (for whatever reason). Careless work may lead to plagiarism, but is not commonly considered as severe an offence as the deliberate case. Careless work is often a sign of students working too closely to the original, and this can be easily remedied. Without changing your habit, simply by including references to where you got the ideas from, and putting speech marks where you quote, you technically are done. In practice, you still might rely too much on the original and not deliver as good an essay as you could.

Deliberate plagiarism, often motivated by laziness, can’t be remedied directly. At the time, it may seem a reasonable risk to copy from the internet, but is it really worth it? Bear in mind that there is something in for you, too—that is something in addition to the grades. The more you write, the easier it gets.

If you work too closely to the original, there is a simple solution: don’t write the essay with the books in front of you. By so doing, there is very little danger that you copy word by word. In a way, you force yourself to make the material your own: and that is a good thing—it makes a better argument, your essay will be more original, and not least, you’ll also get better grades. Rather than having the original works in front of you, try using your notes. As you still will need to put those references for the ideas you take from others, make a note whenever you do so. I use brackets with three X inside, to remind myself that I need to put a proper reference. Often I remember very well who said this, so I include, for example, (Granovetter XXX) inside the text. When checking the essay, it’s hard not to notice the triple X; and there is always the search facility in the word processor. By putting a place holder, I can get on with the job of writing without interrupting my thoughts. Equally important, I leave some traces indicating to myself that there is some more work to be done: finding the proper reference, for example.

If you think plagiarism is hard to detect by your marker, think again. There are a great number of signs that give plagiarized work away. Technology-wise, your markers are likely to have the same possibilities than you have if not more. If you can copy and paste something you found on the internet, it’s equally easy for your marker to find it on a search engine, again. It would, of course, be possible, to change plagiarized work to the extent that the deed is no longer easy to spot. Usually, however, this is just as much work as writing the essay yourself.

Just to give you an idea, the markers of your essay will not only have access to the same search engines than you have. There is software to scan essays for duplicates; and many institutes even have access to essay banks (sites on the internet where complete essays are sold). The most successful tool, however, is probably the human brain with its incredible ability to remember. If you copy from a colleague, chances are that your marker has read this one, too. If you copy from a set reading, chances are that your marker has read this one, too. Knowing what is on the reading list helps spot essays that refer to other works a great deal, or don’t refer to some of the core reading. Your marker can estimate how many readings you had time to read, or whether you’re likely to have read a great number of papers on the ''Belgian'' perspective of whatever issues is set in the question. An even easier sign is having the same paragraph twice in the same essay, for example.

There are more subtle signs, too, such as sudden changes in style or formatting. Many people are unaware of how idiosyncratic one’s writing style is. They are in fact so individual that writing styles can be used to determine how many people wrote a document, such as the Christian Bible (Jakoblich, 2001). Writing style includes the tenses we use, the level of formality, our own choice of words, the kinds of metaphors we put, whether we use American or British English, choices over punctuation, the length of sentences, or the use of specialist terms. Typographic signs include font size, choices of where to break paragraphs, spaces in between lines, and things like proper m- and n-dashes (when copying from electronic articles).

The presence or lack of references is often an easy sign: for example, where there are many references inside the text, but few at the end, or where the citation style changes within a single essay. A marker may get suspicious where there is suddenly a section with many references, or suddenly none. Sometimes, students even include hyperlinks in references when copying from electronic journals; and have them automatically  underlined by the word processor.

Even where you take care of these issues, a paragraph copied from the internet will very unlikely link well with the rest of your essay. The style may be inappropriate, or just different. Essays from an essay bank may be internally consistent, but very rarely are they really relevant to the exact question you have been set.

In summary, you can avoid plagiarism easily. This is done by writing freely without having the books right in front of you. Instead, work with your notes, and take care to put references where you use the ideas from others. Don’t use the internet to copy from, no matter how tempting it is. It will hardly ever be worth it.

==Citations and Quotations==

There is an important difference between citations and quotations. Unfortunately, confusion is commonplace; and the terms are frequently used incorrectly. Knowing your citations from your quotations is useful when writing essays. It’s essential, in fact, if you want to reference properly.

Citations are about ideas you take from others. Quotations are about the exact words used by others. This is really the whole distinction. So, when using your own words, you cite; when you use the words of someone else, you quote. “Why can’t a man be more like a woman?” (Blankenhorn, 1995, p.117) is a quotation, because I use the exact same words Blankenhorn did. However, when stating that families in the US are increasingly defined by the absence of a father (Blankenhorn, 1995), I only use the idea, not the exact words.

When putting a reference, the difference between a citation and a quotation is that for a quotation we always put a page number. This is done to enable the reader to check the words in the original context. In the list of references at the end of the text, there is no difference.

Short quotations are included in the text, and enclosed by speech marks. Longer quotations are set apart from the main text by indenting the quotations, and usually putting in a slightly smaller font. Longer means about 3 to 4 lines or more. For example:

:''It is true that many voters may be voting for reasons wholly unconnected with social inequalities in any of the three dimensions. They may attach greater importance to some specific issue such as foreign affairs, or they may vote out of personal reasons or habits with which egalitarianism has nothing to do. (Runciman, 1966, p.136)''

When quoting someone else, you should take great care to copy the words exactly. Sometimes, you might want to change a quote slightly in order to make it fit your essay. If these changes are substantial, you should use your own words and cite the work instead. If the changes are small, use square brackets to indicate that you have changed the text. For example, you might quote Rawls (1999, p.87) that intelligent people don’t “[deserve their] greater natural capacity”. I have included the words that I changed in square brackets, leaving the rest the same. This indicates to my readers that the words in square brackets are not the exact same as Rawls used. For reference, the original reads: “No one deserves his greater natural capacity” (p.87). I made the changes, because I wrote about intelligent people, and Rawls was talking in more general terms.

Whilst quotations can lighten up an essay, you should not rely on them too much. Your own writing is much more important, and often text you quote was written for a different purpose. The consequence is that the quotations may be relevant in content (what is being said), but in terms of style don’t fit well with what you wrote. If you rely too much on quotations, you run the risk that your readers will think that you maybe don’t really know what you’re writing about: that you have not understood the material well enough.

==When to Put the References==
When writing an essay, particularly when writing an extended essay, it’s easiest to put the references whilst you write. This is the case, because you still know where you got the idea from. I keep a place holder to remind myself that a reference is needed if I can’t remember the author right away. Often, I will know at least some of it, and write this down. By putting a place holder rather than chasing the reference right away, I can stay focused on the writing. However, I also indicate that the essay is not completed. Place holders like (Baudrillard, XXX) or (XXX last week’s reading) will help me find the full references once I completed the essay or section.

References are needed whenever you write an academic piece of writing. Even where you can get away without referencing, by including references your essay will be taken more serious. It’s a good habit to put references all the time, so when you really need to—such as in your thesis—you’ll not struggle, or spend days trying to find out how to reference a chapter in a book.

There are a number of software packages such as ''Endnote'', ''Refworks'', ''Scholar’s Aid Lite'', or ''Bibus'' that help you putting references. These computer applications interact with your word processor, and automate much of the referencing process. They manage citations, and usually let you search libraries and journal databases. Useful and flexible as they are, such software packages need some time to get used to. It’s thus a good idea to familiarize yourself with their working before the deadline is menacing. For example, make sure you know how to put page numbers for quotations.

Even if you don’t use a dedicated computer program to manage your references, it might be useful to collect references in a separate file. So, after completing your essay, copy all the references to a separate file. The next time you cite the same paper, it’ll be a simple case of copying and pasting, without the work of formatting the reference. Keeping the full references with your notes can safe a great deal of time, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Exam Essays=

Exam essays are essays like others. They differ mostly by the constraints of time and therefore space. For these reasons, it’s even more important to follow a clearly structured approach to writing. The time constraints mean that you need to remain very focused in order to make most of what is available to you.

Very important in the setting of the exam is that you delimit the scope of your answer. Often a question is to a certain extent tied with a particular module or even a single lecture. Whilst this helps you in terms of deciding what goes in your essay and what does not, you should always leave some clues to the markers. By being explicit about the content and theories used in the essay, you demonstrate that you have put thought into the question. As a result, the answer will be more focused.

Because of the time/space constraints it’s advisable to reduce many sections, but don’t leave them out. One or two sentences can delimit the scope of the answer. One or two sentences can outline the answer, giving the marker an idea where you’re going to take him or her. The time constraints also mean that you may be better of with choosing a few key arguments and develop them properly. Don’t, however, focus on one side of the argument only: the overall structure of your essay answer should be essentially the same as if you were writing a full length version. What is different is that you may only include one example, or only consider two schools of thought in detail.

It’s usually worth drawing up a quick timetable for the exam. Say there are three questions in three hours, you should spend one hour on each (assuming the same number of points to be gained). You may need 10 or even 15 minutes for a good essay plan, leaving you with about 45 minutes to write up the essay. Ideally, you should allow a few minutes to check what you have written, too.

An exam plan should be clear about the priorities should you run out of time. For example, spending 15 minutes on the introduction will waste time you better spend on the main argument—no matter how brilliant the introduction turns out to be. Make sure you know what your main argument is going to be before starting writing. It’s better to cut short a minor point than missing the key argument. Similarly, never use time allocated for another question to finish off the one you’re working on. You’ll almost certainly lose more points than you gain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Using Feedback=

In many cases your essays are not only graded, but your markers give you feedback on the writing. In order to improve your essay writing skills, you should spend a few moments to read the comments and try to take them as useful criticism. Often it’s a good idea to leave the essay on its own for a day or so, after getting it back. This way you have time to cool down after receiving the mark. Marks are often different from what we expect, either better or worse. Coming back to the essay a day after, you’re able to make the most of the criticism: make it work for you.

A good idea is to go through the comments and identify three good points, and three points you want to work on. For example, your teaching assistant may comment that your overall structure was good. Make a note of it. Then again, maybe you didn’t include enough examples, so that would be something to work on. Even essays with full marks usually come with a few hints what could be done better.

[[Image:Feedback Organizer.png|Example Feedback Organizer|thumb]]

I use a table to collect the grade, three positive and three negative points. When writing the next essay, it’s time to dig out this table, and focus on the three points to improve. Probably you’ll want to choose only one of them, but make a real effort to improve on this one. When planning the essay, as outlined on page 3, you spend a few extra moments just focusing on what you want to do better. It’s by going through this process that you really learn from the feedback on your essays: this is how you develop writing skills.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/149.170.218.1|149.170.218.1]] ([[User talk:149.170.218.1|talk]]) to last version by Recent Runes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Common Essay Problems=

By following the approach of essay writing outlined in this book, you can avoid a whole range of very common essay problems:

# Unstructured: Many essays are not structured, which makes them difficult for the markers to read. Without structure, reading an essay is like a discovery journey: your marker will never be sure what is around the corner. This might sound appealing, but you’re not writing a thriller. Your marker will have difficulty to see whether and how what you write is relevant to the question set. Following the advice in this book, you can avoid this problem by outlining at the beginning how you’re going to answer the question (''delimit''). Your reader will know what is coming up. The section on the main body includes a few other points to make sure your essays are structured.
# Rambling: The problem of rambling is often just a symptom of the above problem: lack of structure. By thinking in a structured way, tendencies to ramble are reduced. Following a reasonable form of preparation will also help (see the section on preparation). Once you know what you’re going to say, and in what order you’re going to say it, it’s much easier to stay on track.
# Not relevant: Unfortunately many essays that are written are as such great essays, but include substantive sections that are not relevant. The problem may be that not enough time is spent planning the essay. It may also be the case, that the irrelevant bits merely appear to be irrelevant. The trick in the latter case is to link the paragraphs using suitable phrases, and actively demonstrate how the illustrations are relevant, for instance.
# Unconnected: For the same reasons as in the above point, essays may be or appear unconnected. A good plan can be the first line of defence: making sure that you yourself know how the different bits link. The next thing to do, again, is using phrases that connect different paragraphs and sections. Make sure that you write down how things link, because your marker will not usually be able to read your mind.
# Unclear: An essay can be well put together, and the reader still be left unclear about what exactly is being said. The problem is in most cases the lack of ''delimitation'' and ''definition''. This means that the essay does not state what is and is not written about, and also that key terms are not defined. Much unclarity can stem from misunderstandings, the reader understanding terms in a different way from what you intended them to mean. What is clear to you may not be so for the marker. Making sure it’s down on paper, this problem can be prevented.
# Difficult: Essays that are difficult to read often suffer from one of the following symptoms: lack of illustrations, lack of conceptual clarity, or lack of guidance. Illustrations are not a nice to have, but an essential part of most essays. Think about the examples when you plan the essay. Conceptual clarity can be remedied by providing definitions, as outlined in the previous point. The lack of guidance means that your readers will feel lost, not knowing where the essay will go next. Providing a clear introduction that delimits the scope of the answer is sometimes all that is needed. Within the main body, linking sections and paragraphs helps further.

The most common problem, probably, is students failing to answer the question. By paying attention to the process and content words, the first part of the problem is already resolved. Writing in a planned and structured way, the remainder is addressed, too. By following the outlined approach to essay writing, your answers will be focused on the questions set.

==Getting Top Grades==

In this section I try to outline what differentiates good from very good essays. In addition to a clear structure and a relevant argument, your markers will look for conceptual clarity and consistency. You can achieve this by taking care to delimit your answer, and define key terms in a way that is relevant to your answer. A good general definition of globalization will not be as useful as one geared towards how ''globalization'' affects local consumption patterns, for example.

Your examiners will also look for critical engagement. Constantly ask yourself how important an argument is. Use different theoretical perspectives (for example functionalism, Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis) and think about how these help understand the problem. Chances are that some theoretical perspectives have very little to say on your particular question. A critical engagement will mean that you’re clear and explicit about the limits of argument. Markers look out for statements like that “X is important, but only in certain areas of life,” or that “Y is important but only when considered together with other concepts,” or that “Z is not as important as X and Y.”

Essays with top grades identify and challenge where appropriate the assumption implicit in a question. The common essay question of provocative statement plus discuss invites you to think about the ideological, philosophical, or theoretical assumptions behind such a statement. A question may actually be the wrong question to ask if you’re approaching the answer from a feminist point of view, rather than a Marxist one, for example. Look out for counter-claims and examine their merit.

A top essay will have a clear and systematic structure. Ideally, at any one point your readers will know where they are, and why they are there. In practice this means that you’ll be clear about what you want to write before you start, and that you organize your thoughts in a coherent manner. The different sections are thus linked in a way obvious both to you and your reader.

Exploring all possibilities is another way to get top grades. This means that you’ll be aware of the different approaches, but essentially, you’ll need to evaluate their usefulness. It’s not just a matter of applying a great number of perspectives, but maybe more importantly one of choosing and selecting which of those carry forward the argument most. This normally involves the rejection of some of the possibilities. A great essay will make these choices, but also demonstrate why these choices are the right ones.

Top-grade essays are also clear about the relevance of what is written. In a paragraph, you not only list the different aspects, for example, and then give an appropriate example. In addition, markers look for a few sentences on the importance of what was just written. This can usually be achieved by linking it back to the question, or other underlying debates. Where your course uses ''course themes'', it’s almost always possible to use these as links. In their feedback, markers often use the phrase “engaging with the question” to refer to this aspect.

==Word Limits==

In most cases when you’re given an essay to write, there is a word limit stated. A word limit is simply an indication how many words you should not exceed in your essay. Sometimes instead a number of pages is given. Word limits exist for a number of reasons. First of all, writing to length is considered a desirable skill. Secondly, having a limit is a way to ensure that you select the most relevant bits. Skills of selection are sought after outside of academia, too. Thirdly, word limits give an indication to you as the writer of what is expected from you.

You should always try as hard as you can not to exceed the word limit. They are called ''limits'' after all, not indications. The most powerful of reasons is probably that you might be penalized. Moreover, keeping to word limits is part of good practice, nice on your readers, and a sign that you possess certain skills. Many institutions practise a formal or informal 10% tolerance. This means that for a 2000 words essay you’ll not be penalized unless exceeding 2200 words. It’s essential that you check, and make sure you check with someone in an adequate position. Staying within the limits is the easier and safer option.

Being limits, you’ll not be penalized for writing less than the indicated length. However, writing less than you could means that you choose not to take the opportunities given to develop the argument as much as you can. It’s for this reason that you might get lower marks. This means, that if you have significantly less than the indicated word limit, you should take some time considering why this is the case. It’s not necessarily a bad sign, but usually means that you could develop the argument further, or that there are no illustrations to bring the essay alive. In either case, your marker will be likely to comment on this.

Planning your essay is the best way to stay within the limits. When drawing up the outline, I always spend a moment thinking about how many words I want to allocate to each section. This not only helps me staying within the word limit, but more importantly, maybe, is the plan for a balanced answer. By planning to write the same amount on two contrasting views, for example, it’s unlikely that I write three quarters of the essay on one side only. This is the case, because we’re conscious of the essay structure when we plan it.

During the process of writing the essay, you can monitor your progress by checking the number of words in your current section. Planning and checking section by section will prevent you from panicking when looking at the overall word count. If you go over, or run out with much to spare, flag the section. Maybe you’ll have an additional idea later on in the day, maybe your plan was not realistic, or maybe you mentioned a point in another section. By having the sections flagged, it’s easier to remedy the length of the essay once completed.

Sometimes there is confusion over what counts as words. Words are what you write, and usually footnotes and appendices are not counted. However, word processors often count these, too. In any case, do check what counts towards the word limit in your institution or course. Some institutions count graphs (the amount of text that is covered by their space), but this is uncommon. Technically, references don’t count towards the word count. If they did, this would encourage sloppy referencing. Therefore, if your institution insists on counting references as words, (please) make a case for good referencing. The list of references at the end of the essay is not included in any case. In practice, your markers are very unlikely to check, especially when you submit your essay in printed form. It’s for reasons like this that many institutions allow you an extra 10%. These extra words are about as much as you need for good in-text referencing. For the same reasons, the length of essays is frequently limited in number of pages. Do check the format expected, such as double-spacing. In any case, you should strive to keep within the word limit, because this is expected from you. The grading of essays is always in relation to what could be said within the limits stated, not what possibly ever could be said about it.

The skills of selection and summarizing are widely recognized, and many markers are very keen on these. Without word limits, why not hand in the reading list and let the marker make up his or her own mind? Surely all the relevant points would be covered…

==Getting Help==

It would be foolish to claim that a short book could be the definite guide to writing essays. Of course it is not. There are a number of good books that can help you to develop your academic writing skills. Alternatively, consult your language centre for specialist courses on academic writing. Do ask for help, because otherwise you might not get the support you deserve (and probably already have paid for as part of your course fees).

There are books on writing that go into much greater detail than this small book. Ask your bookshop or library about what is available, and have a good look what is covered in the book. Books on essay writing in general will never offer you as much advice as those focusing on specific aspects of writing. Everyone has different needs, and a book focusing on the areas of essay writing you’re particularly good at will probably not help you as much as another. Feedback from previous essays may help you find out what areas you want to improve.

For technical details, you might need a good dictionary. If English is not your first language, get hold of a dictionary written for learners of English, such as the ''Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary'' (Hornby, 2005) or the ''Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary'' (Woodford, 2005). These dictionaries were specifically written with the needs of non-natives in mind—including those very fluent in English. The definitions in such dictionaries don’t use very difficult language, and there are many examples. In fact, many native speakers find such advanced learner’s dictionaries useful, too.

The choice of grammar books is vast, and you should pick one you feel comfortable with. Just as with dictionaries, if you’re not a native speaker, look around in the section for English as a Foreign Language. Michael Swan’s ''English Usage'' (1995), for example, is both approachable and comprehensive. Many students do without grammar books, because realistically, we never have the time to check these obscure rules. Similarly, there are authoritative books on the style of your documents, such as ''The Oxford Style Manual'' (Ritter, 2003). Hart’s rules (Ritter, 2005) are often considered authoritative, but often go far beyond the scope of general essay writing. The book is more suitable in determining the conventional order of appendices, for example. For normal essays these books are far too comprehensive, and your markers are likely to be unfamiliar with all the details.

For advice on writing style, there are a great number of books available. Again, check your bookshop or library. Some books focus on the choice of the right word, others on different aspects of style. Note that different books give different stylistic advice. If you don’t want to splash out on a good book, you could do worse than bookmark Paul Brians’ page on common English mistakes (2006). This free and useful guide can come in very handy when in doubt (see reference at the end for URL).

If you’re unsure about plagiarism, or worried about your writing skills: the best way to get help is approaching your tutor or supervisor. They will be familiar with most of the conventions, and equally important, be able to guide you to more specialist assistance should this be necessary. In terms of plagiarism, there are a number of useful internet sites, including the Glatt Self-Detection Programme (2000), and their site at http://www.plagiarism.com/ (1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Summary Page=

This page is a one-page summary of the whole book. A good essay is characterized by following a structured approach of essay writing.

==Audience==
When writing an essay, you should always think about the audience: who do you write for. The audience is often imaginary, but you should never assume that your readers will be very familiar with the special concepts you use. Aim for somebody in your general subject but specializes on a completely different area.

==Structure==
The key to a successful essay is planning the structure: what you’re going to say in what order. There is more than one way to approach every question. Following the following advice will always be a reasonable approach.

==1. Delimiting the Question==
As a first step you’ll state how you understand the question. By doing so, you give your reader a sense of where the essay is going. You also demonstrate that you’re going to answer the question. An important point is to be explicit what goes into the essay and what stays out. A short outline is often helpful.

==2. Defining Key Terms==
Rather than assuming familiarity with the key concepts, always give a brief definition. Not only will your readers know what you talk about, but you also can demonstrate that you know what aspects are the most important ones.

==3. Main Part==
Having outlined what you’re going to write, clarified the key concepts, it’s time to deliver. Essays with a clear structure, following a certain logic are the most successful ones. Don’t hesitate to state how different bits link, or why a certain paragraph is relevant. Include illustrations to bring the argument to life.

==4. Discussion==
After exploring the different aspects in your previous section, it’s time to take a critical stance. Are some aspects more convincing, are others plain wrong? This is the place to bring in your own views and prepare the conclusion.

==5. Conclusion==
You have nearly reached the end. In your final section, summarize the main points of your essay, reminding the reader how you got to where you ended up. Refer to the essay question, showing that you have answered the question you were set.

==References==
Always include full references to all the material cited and quoted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Glossary=

The following is a glossary of some of the technical words used in this book.

'''Body''': The main part of your essay is sometimes called the body. It’s the essay minus the introduction and conclusion.

'''Citation''': A citation is a reference to the work of somebody else. You put a citation whenever you use the ideas of somebody else. Citations are not the same as quotations.

'''Conclusion''': The final part of your essay is the conclusion. It is the part where the essay is brought to an end. A conclusion often summarizes the main arguments of an essay, and presents a view or opinion that is reached after considering different aspects.

'''Content words''': These are words in the essay question that tell you ''what'' to write about. They often also tell you (sometimes indirectly) what sources or texts to use. They are not the same as the ''process words''.

'''Definition''': A definition is a short explanation of what a term or concept means. It focuses on the main aspects or components.

'''Essay''': An essay is an analytic piece of work. It is usually divided into an introduction, the main argument (body), and a conclusion.

'''Example''': ''see illustration''

'''Full references''': ''see reference''

'''Heading''': This describes the style of a line that is set apart from the rest of the text. The heading indicates what the section immediately following is about. Smaller headings are called ''subheading''.

'''Illustration''': These are examples that you include in your essay to make the text more approachable. Illustrations link the abstract argument with practical examples. Illustrations in this context don’t normally refer to pictures.

'''In-text reference''': ''see reference''

'''Introduction''': The introduction of an essay is the opening section. It outlines what the essay is about, and serves to indicate how the essay question is answered in the remainder of the essay.

'''Linking word''': Linking words are words and phrases that join different parts of the essay. They can link sentences, paragraphs, or even sections. Such words include ''however'', ''in contrast'', ''on the other hand'', ''but'', or ''furthermore''.

'''m-dash''': This is a long dash used in printed works (— sign).

'''Marker''': Your essay is marked and graded by a person. Depending on the course and institution, this may be your tutor, your supervisor, or a teaching assistant.

'''Memo''': This is usually a shorter piece of writing with specific content. Unlike an essay, a memo is geared towards highlighting certain aspects, such as the social mechanisms involved in a chosen topic.

'''n-dash''': This is a long dash used in printed works (– sign). It is shorter than the m-dash, but longer than a hyphen (- sign).

'''Outline''': An outline is a short and tentative overview of what the essay is about. Only the main points and arguments are included.

'''Paragraph''': This is a distinct subdivision in a text. In your essay, you should break up the text into several paragraphs. Each paragraph develops a separate thought, and makes one statement only.

'''Process words''': These are words in the essay question that tell you ''how'' to approach and structure your answer. For example, ''discuss'' is a process word. Process words are not the same as ''content words''.

'''Question''': The essay question is a short indication of what your essay should be about. It outlines the subject and often gives instructions how to approach the answer.

'''Quotation''': A quotation is the use of the ''exact'' words of somebody else’s words. Quotations are usually put between speech marks to indicate that they are not your own words. They are also known as quotes, but are not the same as ''citations''.

'''Reference''': This is a short note included in the text indicating to the reader where a citation or quotation originates. A common form of referencing is a note in brackets where the author and year of publication are given. Full references are given at the end of the essay, providing further information. An in-text reference allows identifying the full reference at the end. The full reference, in turn, allows identifying the work used.

'''Report''': A report is a piece of writing that differs from essays. It is usually more focused in making points and outlining the findings, and less on developing the arguments. Sometimes bullet points are used.

'''Structure''': The structure of an essay describes how it’s built, how the different parts of the essay link together to create the complete essay. Your essay should include an introduction, a section defining key terms, a main part (body), and a conclusion. Within these parts, your essay should be divided into logical sections, consisting of separate paragraphs.

'''Subheading''': This is a heading that is of lower importance than a heading. Technically still a heading, a subheading is set apart from main headings, such as by being set in a smaller font.

'''Summary''': A summary is a brief statement of the main points or arguments of your essay, or the section summarized.

      <comment>the 2nd question was wrong because as stated within the actual question the slit separation is 0.05m and therefore d=0.05 not 0.1. This therefore will affect the whole solution.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A 2-slit experiment is set up in which the slits are 0.03 m apart. A bright fringe is observed at an angle 10° from the normal. What sort of electromagnetic radiation was being used?'''

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = d\sin{\theta} = 0.03 \times \sin{10} \approx 5.21 \times 10^{-3}\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

So, microwaves were being used.

'''2. Light, with a wavelength of 500 nm, is shone through 2 slits, which are 0.05 m apart. What are the angles to the normal of the first three dark fringes?'''

&lt;math&gt;n \times 500 \times 10^{-9} = 0.05 \times \sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an odd integer.

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin{\frac{n \times 500 \times 10^{-9}}{0.05}} = \arcsin{(n \times 500 \times 10^{-8})}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, substitute in n = 1,3 and 5 to gain corresponding values of θ:

{| cellpadding = &quot;3&quot;
!''n''
!θ (°)
|-
|''1''
|5.730 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''3''
|5.2360 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''5''
|8.7266 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|}

'''3. Some X-rays, with wavelength 1 nm, are shone through a diffraction grating in which the slits are 50 μm apart. A screen is placed 1.5 m from the grating. How far are the first three light fringes from the point at which the normal intercepts the screen?'''

&lt;math&gt;n \times 10^{-9} = \frac{50 \times 10^{-6} \times x}{1.5} \approx 33.3 \times 10^{-6} \times x&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an integer.

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{n \times 10^{-9}}{33.3 \times 10^{-6}} = 30 \times 10^{-6} \times n&lt;/math&gt;

Then, substitute in n = 1,2 and 3 to gain corresponding values of x:

{| cellpadding = &quot;3&quot;
!''n''
!x (m)
|-
|''1''
|30 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''2''
|60 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''3''
|90 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-

      <comment>/* Gravity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Forces==
Forces are vectors. When solving problems involving forces, it is best to think of them as lots of people pulling ropes attached to an object. The forces are all pulling in different directions, with different magnitudes, but the effect is in only one direction, with only one magnitude. So, you have to add the forces up as vectors.

Forces cause things to happen. They cause an object to accelerate in the same direction as the force. In other words, forces cause objects to move in a direction closer to the direction they are pulling in. If the object is already moving, then they will not cause it to move in the direction of the force, as forces do not create velocities: they create accelerations.

If a force is acting on an object, it seems logical that the object will not accelerate as much as a result of the force if it has a lower mass. This gives rise to the equation:

&lt;math&gt;F = ma\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where F = force applied (in Newtons, denoted N), m = mass (in kg) and a = acceleration (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). If we rearrange the equation, it makes more sense:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the acceleration in a given direction as the result of a force is equal to the force applied per. unit mass in that direction.

==Work Done==
You should already know how to calculate some types of energy, for example:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Kinetic Energy } = \frac{mv^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Gravitational Potential Energy } = mgh\,&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of energy converted by a force is equal to the work done, which is equal (as you already know) to the force multiplied by the distance the object it is acting on moves:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Work Done } = \Delta E = F\Delta s\,&lt;/math&gt;

When answering questions about work done, you may be given a force acting in a direction other than that of the displacement. In this case, you will have to find the displacement in the direction of the force, as shown in the section on [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Vectors|Vectors]].

==Power==

Power is the rate of change of energy. It is the amount of energy converted per. unit time, and is measured in Js&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\Delta E}{t}&lt;/math&gt;,

where E = energy (in J) and t = time (in s). Since ΔE = work done, power is the rate at which work is done. Since:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = F\Delta s\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E}{t} = F\frac{\Delta s}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = Fv\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where P = power (in Watts, denoted W), F = force and v = velocity.

==Gravity==
Gravity is something of a special case. The acceleration due to gravity is denoted g, and is equal to 9.81359ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is uniform over small distances from the Earth. The force due to gravity is equal to mg, since F = ma. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{mg}{m} = g&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when things are dropped, they all fall at the same acceleration, regardless of mass. Also, the acceleration due to gravity (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) is equal to the gravitational field strength (in Nkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Questions==

1. I hit a ball of mass 5g with a cue on a billiards table with a force of 20N. If friction opposes me with a force of 14.2N, what is the resultant acceleration of the ball away from the cue?

2. A 10g ball rolls down a 1.2m high slope, and leaves it with a velocity of 4ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. How much work is done by friction?

3. An electric train is powered on a 30kV power supply, where the current is 100A. The train is travelling at 90 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the net force exerted on it in a forwards direction?

Resultant force = 20 - 14.2 = 5.8N

F = ma

5.8 = (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)a

a = 1160ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''2. A 10g ball rolls down a 1.2m slope, and leaves it with a velocity of 4ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. How much work is done by friction?'''

g.p.e. at top of slope = mgh = 10 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; x 9.81 x 1.2 = 0.117J

k.e. at bottom of slope = ½mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 x 10 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; x 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.08J

Assuming the remainder of the g.p.e. becomes heat / sound due to friction:

work done by friction = 0.117 - 0.08 = 0.037J.

'''3. An electric train is powered on a 30kV power supply, where the current is 100A. The train is travelling at 90 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the net force exerted on it in a forwards direction?'''

P = IV = Fv

90 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.025 km&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 25 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

100 x 30 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 25F

F = 120000N

The spindle can be soft woods, yucca, mullen, hazel, aspen, cedar, and most willows all work very well. The hearth fire board should be yucca, cottonwood, and cedar. Combination of material for spindel and board can be hazel and poplar as well. 

The bow should be stiff but slightly limber and around 30 inches long. The bearing block can be made of anything but bone, antler, and stone work the best as they can be easily greased, do not create as much friction, and do not burn.

The bow drill is an ancient tool. While it was usually used to make fire, it was also used for primitive woodworking and dentistry. It consists of a bearing block or handhold, a spindle or drill, a hearth or fireboard, and a simple bow. Related drills include the pump drill and the hand drill.

The spindle, carved to reduce friction at one end and maximize it at the other, is held at one end by the bearing block, and at the other by the hearth. The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is taut enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this called the ''Egyptian Bow Drill'' attaches the string in a slightly different way.

The usual position that a person assumes whilst operating the bow drill is as follows: the right knee is placed on the ground (assuming a right-handed operator) and the arch of the left foot is on the board, pinning it in place. The left wrist, holding the handhold, is hooked around the left shin so it can generate enough downward pressure and speed; achieved by pushing down with the handhold and spinning the drill. The heat of the friction between the hearth and the spindle both creates charred, fuzzy dust and causes it to ignite - forming a coal or ember. The handhold is lubricated and the spindle is carved to about thumb thickness, usually six to eight inches long.

An indentation and a &quot;v&quot; notch into the center of the dent is made into the fireboard and the spindle is placed on it. The notch allows a place for the dust collect while it is being abraded off the spindle and the hearth. Eventually, the friction generates heat to ignite the dust, which can be used to light tinder.

Whilst a &quot;v&quot; is most common, other methods to create a cavity to contain the dust whilst it is being ignited can be used. For example: drilling part-way into a hearth made by lashing two sticks together from one side, and then drilling from the other side to meet this hole; or using the area where two branches separate. This is to keep the coal off wet or snow covered ground.

This is by far the easiest method of producing a coal by primitive means and anyone can do it by using good materials and maintaining a calm mentality, concentrating only on working everything slowly and smoothly.

Survival skills are skills that may help everyone to survive dangerous situations (such as storms or earthquakes), or in dangerous places (such as the desert, the mountains, and the jungle). Useful skills include lighting a fire, finding shelter, making water safe to drink, finding and identifying food, treating injuries, and climbing, swimming, and using specific or makeshift tools.

Each type of wilderness challenges a person with a different range of dangers (see hazards of outdoor activities). An environment may be dry, wet, hot, cold, high altitude, low altitude, desert, rural, urban, wilderness, subterranean, or an island. There are four basic necessities of life which apply in all of these cases: shelter, water, fire, and food. A fifth is oxygen for high altitudes and subterranean environments, and also specific survival situations such as drowning and landslide/avalanche.

Survival skills used on a more permanent basis, or as a component of daily life are referred to as bushcraft.

Developments in outdoor equipment and survival techniques have skewed the scale towards man- if one is prepared, but there is nothing to replace experience in a survival situation. Those who are most prepared physically and mentally stand the greatest chance of survival.

== &lt;big&gt;OCR&lt;/big&gt; ==

&lt;u&gt;Optical character recognition&lt;/u&gt;, usually abbreviated to OCR, 
its is used for translation of images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text.
this is a field of a research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and machine vision.
It is mainly based on the handwritten scripts.

== Touchscreen ==
is a display which can detect the location of touches 
within the display area.They have many features as follows Resistive,
Surface acoustic wave,Capacitive,Infrared,Optical imaging.Example of a touch screen 
application software will be Nintendo DS.

== Keyboard ==

Keyboard is used for many function it helps us in different symbols; typically, this is because they are writing in different languages.
There are many different types of keyboards, like wireless keyboards which increase the freedom of the user and it becomes more user friendly. Made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels arrayed in front of a light source or reflector
The wireless keyboard signals are sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer.There many advantages of a 
keyboard as they have many special keys. There are lot of  different types keyboard for example-Multimedia keyboards,Gaming keyboards,Virtual keyboards.

== MICR ==
-Magnetic ink character recognition

Characters are printed in a special ink which contains tiny magnetic particles. A reading head is passed over the specially shaped characters and recognises the shape of each by its magnetic field. The computer can therefore capture the data printed in magnetic ink.
MICR has the following advantages:
It's both machine and human readable (unlike the magnetic strip on a credit card)
The data can be read even if the paper on which it is printed is marked or folded
Due to the rarity of magnetic ink printers it is relatively hard to forge. It has the following disadvantages:
A particular font has to be used so that it can be recognised
Exposure of the printing to a strong magnetic field can make the data unreadable (though it can still be keyed in)

== Plotter ==
is a vector graphical printing device that connects to a computer.
They can draw complex line art, including text, but do so very slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens.
Plotters are not very efficient in their work as they cannot draw or create a solid region of color.

== LCD ==
Liquid crystal display is a flat device and up of any number of color or monochrome pixels arrayed in front of a light source or reflection.
There are many advantages of LCD Sharpness,Geometric Distortion,Brightness,Screen Shape,Physical.
But there also some disadvantages of LCD Resolution ,Interference,Black-Level, Contrast and Color Saturation ,
Motion Artifacts ,Aspect Ratio. 

Black-Level, Contrast and Color Saturation
LCDs have difficulty producing black and very dark grays. As a result they generally have lower contrast than CRTs and the color saturation for low intensity colors is also reduced. Not suitable for use in dimly lit and dark environments.


== Resolution ==
Each panel has a fixed pixel resolution format determined at the time of manufacture that can not be changed. 
All other image resolutions require rescaling, which generally results in significant 
image degradation, particularly for fine text and graphics.

== Interference ==
LCDs using an analog input require careful adjustment of pixel tracking/phase in order to reduce or eliminate digital noise in the image. Automatic pixel tracking/phase controls seldom produce the optimum setting. Timing drift and jitter may require 
frequent readjustments during the day.

== Black-Level ==
LCDs have difficulty producing black and very dark grays. As a result they generally have lower contrast than CRTs and the color saturation for low intensity colors is also reduced. Not suitable for use in dimly lit and dark environments.



== &lt;big&gt;Sensor&lt;/big&gt; ==

Sensor is a device which determines a physical quantity and transfers it into a signal which can be read by an 
onlooker or by an instrument.Sensor is used in our active life for instance infrared sensor is used in corridors by which 
minimize the energy consumption.   
There are many different types of censors as follows.
Thermal,Electronics's,Mechanical,Chemical.

&lt;big&gt;Optical radiation&lt;/big&gt;
Light time-of-flight. Used in modern surveying equipment, a short pulse of light is emitted and returned by a retro reflector.


&lt;big&gt;Advantages&lt;/big&gt;
Smart sensor is an instrument which can transfer the information wirelessly to an Ethernet monitoring point. 

Wireless  sensor network is very friendlily instrument easy to install no wires are needed,it also allows an easy way 
for upgrading of existing unit.But there are some setbacks of wireless sensor it has a relatively slow speed of communication
it also get sidetracked for example blue tooth .


=Graphic tablets =
This is a computer input device which allows hand-draw images and graphics, similar to the way one draws images with a pencil and paper.It's a flat surface area on which you can draw, write, etc.

Mainly there are two types of graphic tablets:
Passive tablet is electromagnetic induction .The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by the LC circuit in the pen. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the pen.By the use of the electromagnetic signals the tablet is capable of using he stylus position without the stylus having to even touch the surface, and powering the pen with this signal means that devices used with the tablet never need batteries. 

Active tablets
This is little bit different from he stylus used contains self-powered electronics that generate and transmit a signal to the tablet.


== Process architecture ==
is a process system which applies such as computer,hardware,software,networking.
process can be defined as having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs.

Architecture 
Besides a propensity to modeling dualistic real-world behavior, PNs also offer a way to manage complex process systems hierarchically. Using classical PN construction rules, Petri nets of Petri nets can be built and a hierarchical conception of a complex process system can be studied. This structure of hierarchical abstraction is the heart of process architecture.


A Hint from an ARKIS senior 2012 is also the processor Architecture which is the single and multiple piplines the multiple pipline works in parrallel therorefre incrase the rate of intrruction bring processed

also guys dont forget the Primary Memory Architecture which is from an Known Examiner he told me that in May 2012 CS exam this will come ;) it's about the SRAM and DRAM SRAM stands for Static RAM which is expensive however therefore used for Cache memory and the DRAM is usually used for main memory also dont forget the main development which is EPROM which allow users to write over ROM

=Abstract Data Structures and Algorithms=
==Fundamentals==
==Static data structures==
==Dynamic data structures==
==Objects in problem solutions==
==Recursion==
Example (Java):

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
public static int factorial(int num) {
    int ans;
    if(num !== 1) {
        ans = factorial(num-1) * num;
    }
    return ans;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a simple code to represent the value of factorial.

==Algorithm Evaluation==
===Efficiency of Algorithms===
To optimize algorithms, one must first know whether a certain algorithm is better or worse than another one. In this case, better can mean that the algorithm processes data faster or that less RAM is used. To measure data processing speed, one can use Big O notation.

Big O notation is always in the form of O(expression). The expression inside the parentheses is different for different efficiencies. It almost always contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of items of data to be processed. The Big O notation of a linear search on an array (of size n) is O(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). This means that doubling the array size will, on average, double the time for the linear search to complete.

Big O notation does not, however, indicate exactly how efficient an algorithm is. It only indicates how much the time spent increases when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is very large and is increased. For instance, if a certain algorithm takes &lt;math&gt;0.5n + 2&lt;/math&gt; milliseconds for each item of data, it will still have a Big O notation of O(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). This is because when n gets to, say, one trillion, the added 2 will have almost no effect, so it is discarded. In the same way, all coefficients of n are discarded.

Other examples of Big O notation include O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;) for bubble and selection sort and O(&lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;) for binary search. Note that binary search’s Big O notation is &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, because logarithms of different bases increase in approximately the same way when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large.</text>

=Further System Fundamentals=
==Processor configuration==

===Instruction Register===
An '''Instruction Register''' is the part of a CPUs control unit (as seen below) that stores an instruction. The bits of the instruction register are decoded by a microprogram that controls the computer.

===Accumulator===
An '''Accumulator''' is a register within the ALU (as seen below). It temporarily stores the data from an arithmetical or logical operation, and then writes it to main memory or to another, non-accumulator CPU register (depending on what it is told to do).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Irvine |first= Kip R. |title= Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers |year= 2007 |edition= 5th edition |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |id=ISBN 0-13-238310-1 |pages=pp. 633, 622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program Counter===
A '''Program Counter''' is a register located in the CPU (as seen below). It is used to hold the address of the next instruction to be fetched from the immediate access memory for execution by the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Hutchinson Encyclopaedia |publisher=Helicon Publishing LTD 2008.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Magnetic Disk Storage==

The most common physical device for storing files is the '''magnetic disk'''. A magnetic disk has one or more ''platters'' in the form of disks, covered with magnetic media. ''Hard disk'' platters are made of rigid metal, while ''floppy disks'' are made of more flexible plastic. Each platter on the magnetic disk has two working ''surfaces''. Older hard disk drives would sometimes not use the very top or bottom surface of a stack of platters because they were more likely to be damaged.

The surface of a platter is organized as a number of round rings, called ''tracks''. The group of tracks immediately above one another (as seen in the diagram below) is called a cylinder. 

Furthermore, each track is divided into ''sectors''. The information held in one sector, a ''block'', is the unit of transfer between the disk and primary memory (normally 4K bytes or so). The operating system determines where the blocks for each file are placed.

The data on a magnetic disk is read by read-write ''heads''. The standard configuration (as seen below) uses one head per surface, each on a separate ''arm'', and controlled by a common ''arm assembly'' which moves all heads simultaneously from one cylinder to another.

The rate at which data can be transferred from the disk to the computer is composed of 3 different steps:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Seek time
| The time to move the heads to the right track.
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Latency (rotational delay)
| The time waiting for the sector to come round to the head.
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Block transfer time
| Time it takes to actually transfer the data.
|}


All these times are of the order of tens of milliseconds. The seek time and latency time vary, depending on where the required block is relative to the current position of the heads. It's useful to put all the blocks of a file on one track, to minimize seek times and latencies in accessing the file. Likewise, for a larger file, it's a good idea to have it all on the same cylinder (a set of corresponding tracks on different platters). There are many other placement tricks (such as placing heavily used files on the middle tracks so that the average seek time is reduced). However, since files are of varying sizes, and can change size dynamically, it's not usually possible to place the blocks optimally. &lt;ref name=&quot;Magnetic disk storage&quot;&gt;Magnetic disk storage[http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handshaking===
The definition of handshaking is described as when one computer is establishing a connection between the other computer or any other device that wants to connect to the computer. The handshake can be brought down into steps such as it will verify the connection, the speed and the authorization of the computer that it is trying to connect to. Example: When a modem connects to another modem, the dialling is the handshake between them. Modem handshakes can be muted by going to the control panel. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Handshaking.&quot; &lt;http://www.mrhope.com/jargon/h/handshak.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Handshaking.&quot; &lt;http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/Windows/HTML/IOa3.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port===
The port connection is commonly found behind the back of the computer it usually resembles a plug-in. Hardware ports allows it to access to external devices. Such as USB, printers, mouse. 

When referring to the internet or the network, a network port is a location where the information is sent. A more commonly used port is the http which is port 80. Which is commonly known as the Virtual Port.

A common way to manage a transfer is to provide a status in bits, which will be sent to a secondary input port. An example would be, a one in a single bit can tell the CPU that the printer is ready to take in more data. If a zero appears it would tell the CPU that the printer is busy therefore the CPU should not send any new data just yet. Another example would be if one bit in a different port could tell the CPU that a keystroke is hit and it is available at the data port. If the zero is shown it means that there was no keyboard stroke.

===Virtual Port===
A virtual port is an emulation of the serial port. The port can be created by a software which will enable extra ports in the system. A virtual port can be given any name (COM1337, VSP11, etc). There can be an unlimited number of virtual ports in your PC. The more ports the less computer performance it has. 

Virtual ports copy all hardware serial port functionality, including Baud rate, Data bits, Parity bits, Stop bits, etc. They control the data flow, copying all signal lines (DTR/DSR/CTS/RTS/DCD/RI) and customizing pinout. A common virtual port is Bluetooth.  A virtual port can be useful if there are less physical ports on the computer. Another use of a virtual port is to communicate with other serial devices via the internet or LAN and act as if they were connected together. Such examples can be found in applications such as Hamachi and Garena.

===Buffer===
A buffer is a part of the memory used to hold temporarily data while it is moved from one place to another. The data is stored in a buffer which will then be received from an input device such as a keyboard to an output device such as a printer. When a data is moving between processes in a computer a buffer is also used. This can be related to buffers in telecommunication. Buffers can be found in a hardware or software but it is mostly implemented in software. If the data that is being transferred has a different rate at which it is received and processed, then the buffers are typically used in a scenario such as this.  Buffers are in a combination with the I/O to hardware, such examples are the disk drives, sending and receiving data from one place to another, or playing sound on a speaker.

====Buffer and the Cache====
Some cache acts like a buffer. But it is not exactly the same, a cache operates on the premise that the same datum (plural for data) will be read from multiple times. The purpose of a cache is to reduce accesses to slower storage. A Cache is an abstraction layer meaning that it is a way of hiding the details of a particular set of functionality. Such as the OSI 7 Layer Model.

===Data Transfer===

Computers always need to transfer data with other external devices (Input/Output devices). There are two different ways for transferring the data between computer memory and external devices:

====PIO====

''PIO'' ('''P'''rogrammed '''I'''/'''O''') is a method in which processor keeps on reading or writing on a memory unit (8-bits, 16-bits or 32-bits, depending on the device interface) until the data transferring is completed. Obviously this method consumes a large amount of processor cycles.
There are several different speeds of PIO, knows as programmed I/O modes, or more commonly, PIO modes. Table below shows five different PIO modes:

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Mode 1
| 600
| 3.3
| ATA
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Mode 2
| 383
| 5.2
| ATA
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Mode 3
| 240
| 8.3
| ATA
|- align=&quot;center&quot;

| 11.1
| ATA-2
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Mode 5
| 120
| 16.7
| ATA-2
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
PIO was the only method for transferring the data between devices and IDE/ATA hard disks through the mid 90s.
Three lower-speed modes (Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3) were defined as part of the original ATA standards document; two more (Mode 4, Mode 5) were added as part of ATA-2 (as well as part of several unofficial standards.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Programmed I/O (PIO) Modes&quot;&gt;PIO[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/modes_PIO.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct Access Memory====

''DAM'' ('''D'''irect '''A'''ccess '''M'''emory) is a capability that allows the data on an external attached device (such as a Disk Drive) to be sent directly to the computer's memory on the motherboard. In DMA method the system issues an I/O command to the device, initiate a DMA transaction and then place the process in a waiting queue and the processor will be free afterwards to do other transmissions or execute codes. The DMA controller will inform the system when its current operation has been completed by issuing an interrupt signal. Although the data is still transferred 1 memory unit at a time from the device, the transfer to main memory now circumvents the CPU because the DMA controller can directly access the memory unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;The 8237 DMA Controller&quot;&gt;The 8237 DMA Controller[http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/~lraitt/doc_8237.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Let's go more in depth!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As it was mentioned in DMA method the processor is not involved during the whole transmission; but it only initiates the transmission and after that the data can be transferred directly from or to the main memory. But how do the CPU do that?&lt;br&gt;
To initiate a transmission the processor should load three different values into three different registers in the DMA controller. These values are:&lt;br&gt;
     1- identity of the source device&lt;br&gt;
     2- the location in memory where the data transfer begins&lt;br&gt;
     3- the number of bytes to be transferred&lt;br&gt;
The DMA controller then collaborates with the IO unit using the control lines on the bus to perform the handshaking protocol for managing the data transfer. When the transfer is complete, the DMA notifies the CPU via an interrupt. With the DMA, data does not pass through the CPU registers, but directly along the bus from source to destination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer Architecture&quot;&gt;DMA – Direct Memory Access[http://www.academic.marist.edu/~jzbv/architecture/CMSC%20415.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Direct Access Memory====
Direct memory access also known as DMA is a feature of modern computers. Within certain computers the hardware subsystems has its access system memory which is used for reading and/or writing independently of the central processing unit(CPU). Many systems use DMA, such example could include disk drive controllers, graphics cards, network cards, and sound cards. Computers that have DMA can transfer data from devices with less CPU overhead than computers without a DMA channel. 

Without the DMA the CPU would be fully occupied for the entire duration of the read and write operation and it would not be able to do any other work. The DMA can start transfer, operate programs, and receive and interrupt from the DMA controller. Which can be useful to real-time computing.

&lt;big&gt;Vote!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Can you please vote and tell us which definition for &quot;Direct Access Memory&quot; is more clear to you? You can respond in the discussion section.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Polling and Interrupts==

One of the duties of the processor in the computers is to manage the devices and programs and since there are many devices connected to the processor and also so many programs (those are running on the OS) the processor needs to be able to figure out what should it do in each moment. Two different ways of doing this are ''Polling'' and using ''Interrupts''.

===Polling===

'''Polling''' is a method in which the processor checks every single device's current status in a loop and looking for data. When new data is available on one of devices it can then read the data and process the incoming bytes.&lt;br&gt;
However this method can work to manage the devices and programs, there are some big problems with it. First, the processor would always be busy with checking all the devices and programs instead of processing data and executing some useful codes. Second, in this method it is very likely that some of arriving bytes are lost when the rate of transfer data is too high.&lt;ref name=&quot;SunSite&quot;&gt;Sunsite  [http://sunsite.nus.sg/LDP/LDP/tlk/node86.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interrupts===

An '''Interrupt''' is a signal from a device attached to the computer or a program that is sent to the OS (Operating System) and causes it to stop and figure out what to do next. Interrupts initiated by hardwares are called ''Hardware Interrupts'' while the interrupts that have been made by programs are called ''Software Interrupts'', ''traps'' or ''exceptions''. An average PC supports 16 hardware interrupts and 256 software interrupts. Each type of exception (Software Interrupt) is associated with a routine that takes control when an interrupt occurs. This routine is called ''Interrupt Handler''.&lt;br&gt;
An Actual interrupt that is sent to the processor is called an '''IRQ''' (Interrupt Request). Each IRQ is a binary code that differs from other interrupts and the processor uses these binary codes to distinct different interrupts. However these interrupts may be different for each device and processor but they usually follow a standard. The typical Hardware Interrupts have been shown in the table below&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadband&quot;&gt;BroadBand  [http://www.dslreports.com/faq/1585]&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;br&gt;

When one of the Input or Output devices sends an interrupt to the CPU, before the processor catches it, that IRQ goes through a chip called '''PIC''' (Programmable Interrupt Controller). The PIC selects an IRQ from the highest priority device to pass to the CPU and if the processor is ready to accept that IRQ, the PIC sends it to the CPU. The processor has a flag that illustrates whether or not it is ready to accept IRQs. If the CPU catches the request (because as it was mentioned it can also ignore a request) it temporary stops what it is currently doing and executes the proper code related to that request. When the ISR is completed, the CPU returns to the program it was executing and resumes its previous task.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interrupts&quot;&gt;Interrupt Control[http://www.xgc.com/manuals/m1750-ada/m1750/x1076.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to find the IRQs of your devices in windows, open the device manager (you can either right click on MyComputer -Or Computer
in Windows Vista- and then click on properties. Then Click on the Device manager. Or simply search for device  manager in your 
computer). Right click on any device and in the form that is opened go to the Resources tab and look at the binary code in fromt of

| '''Comparison between polling and interrupt systems'''
|-
| As it was mentioned, in the polling systems the processor should check the status of all of the devices (and programs those are running on the OS) in a loop to see what should it do next; while in a system which uses interrupts, the processor does not need to keep checking all of the devices and programs, but every device sends a signal to the processor whenever it needs. Obviously in the first method the CPU is always busy with checking the devices and therefore it has less power to execute useful codes and process data. another disadvantage with this method is that a device or program which wants to interact with processor should wait until the processor finishes the loop and turn to that specific device or program. while in interrupt systems, the client sends a signal (i.e. a byte) and informs the processor. as the result the speed of communication between clients and the processor will speed up in the systems those are using interrupts.

===Serial and Parallel Transmission===
Data are transmitted through a communications medium, they are either sent in serial or in parallel transmission. Most of the owners of microcomputers know that their computers are equipped with serial and parallel ports. In which it will enable the computer to transmit both serial and parallel signals. 

In both of the series, the bytes that are sent are sent along a medium. For example if it would send “SYAMIL”, it would sent the “S” first, then “Y” then “A” and so on this goes for serial. As for parallel transmission, they are sent separately, the parallel paths correspond to each bit of a byte so that all of the bits would arrive simultaneously. 

Since parallel is more efficient then serial, it would need more wiring and extra bit paths, besides that it is more expensive then serial. Devices that are located near each other usually will use a serial transmission. For example, a parallel transmission computer would send a word document to a printer that it is connected to. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Serial and Parallel Transmission.&quot; &lt;http://www.blurtit.com/q511025.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of equipment are used in a kitchen. One of the Wikibooks Cookbook's goals is to have an article on each, including uses, alternative equipment if you don't have the exact item, and a buying guide. The various equipment modules can be reached from the following organization pages. Pots and pans hold food, generally for cooking on a firepit. Dark gummy burned-on oil can be removed with acetone, widely available from hardware stores and in diluted form as nail polish remover.

Food is not urgently needed in survival situations, since a human can survive for several weeks without it. However, much like dehydration, hunger can bring about many consequences long before it causes death, such as:
&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-left:200px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irritability and low morale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of mental clarity, such as confusion, disorientation, or poor judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakened immune system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty maintaining body temperature (see heat exhaustion and hypothermia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is actually rather easy to find food in most wild environments, provided one knows where to look. A basic knowledge of animal trapping, hunting, and fishing will provide meat. Equally important is a knowledge of edible plants, fungi, and lichens. One cannot always rely on the most abundant or most easily accessible type of food. To survive for long periods of time, one must maintain a balanced diet. In order to do this, one must consume a balanced variety of foods.

Finding food in the wild depends on your environment (i.e. vegetation, animals, and water sources). Many survival books promote the &quot;Universal Edibility Test&quot;: allegedly, one can distinguish edible foods from toxic ones by a series of progressive exposures to skin and mouth prior to ingestion with waiting periods and checks for symptoms. However, many other experts including Ray Mears and John Kallas reject this method, in main part because a very small amount of some &quot;potential foods&quot; can cause anything from gastric distress to illness or death. An additional step called the &quot;scratch test&quot; is sometimes included. In this step (before mouth contact of the proposed food) one makes an abrasion on the surface of an area of skin (such as with fingernails) and then lightly rubs some of the food product on the abrasion. Foods that cause surface inflammation, discomfort, itching or eruption should be avoided.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A human can survive a maximum of three days without the intake of water, assuming you are at sea level, at room temperature, and a relative humidity. When camping in an area that does have running water, make sure that it is OK for drinking. If you see a sign that says &quot;Non-potable Water,&quot; that means that it is NOT OK to drink. Rather, non-potable water is only suitable for flushing toilets and washing hands.

When camping in an area that does not have running water and toilets, you must either bring water with you, or bring along the means for purifying water you collect when you arrive. Do not assume that because a stream or lake looks clean that it is OK to drink. In general, it is not, and drinking it without treating it carries a high risk of causing diarrhea or vomiting. Do not brush your teeth, cook with, or drink non-potable water without purifying it first.

In colder temperatures and/or with rain or snow the length or likelihood of survival would be greatly reduced. In addition to the aforementioned priorities, length of survival also depends on amount of physical exertion. A typical person will lose 2-3 liters of water per day in ordinary conditions, but more in hot, dry, or cold weather.

A lack of water causes dehydration, resulting in lethargy, headaches, dizziness, confusion, and eventually death. Even mild dehydration reduces endurance and impairs concentration, which is dangerous in a survival situation where clear thinking is essential. Your body requires 4L to 6L of water or other liquids each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep your body functioning properly.

Dark yellow or brown urine indicates dehydration. Because of these risks, a safe supply of drinking water must be located as soon as a shelter is built (or even before, depending on conditions).

==Acquiring water==
Water can be gathered in numerous ways: scooped out of a creek or pond; rainwater can be caught in makeshift containers; collect dew from vegetation in clothing articles. Many tree roots and vines contain water, however water from poisonous vegetation can be lethal. Nonpoisonous cactus is also a source of water, confirming the myth- pulp can be removed from the broken stem.

In a survival situation, any water supply may be contaminated with pollutants or pathogens (see Potability of backcountry water). Although little can be done to remove molecular contaminants, particles and microorganisms can be removed and/or killed (see Portable water purification). In a beach situation, digging in the sand below sea level, the sand well will fill with drinkable water; it may taste salty or brackish, but the sand acts as a filter reducing the salt content the further you dig inland. Stagnant water can be made drinkable by filtration through a sieve of charcoal.

Animal blood is not suitable for rehydration as it may be diseased. In addition, because of the nutrients it contains, it requires energy to digest. Mammals all have blood-borne pathogens so the animal must also be cooked. Urine contains salt and other toxins, which also makes it unsuitable to drink, although it can be refined in a solar still.

Many birds, mammals, and some insects, such as bees, ants, and mason flies, are reliable indications of water, either through a stream or a soaked patch of earth.

The U.S. Army survival manual recommends that you use your water whenever thirsty to avoid &quot;voluntary&quot; dehydration. Other groups recommend rationing water through &quot;water discipline&quot;.

While finding water is most important, preventing water loss is also an issue. Resting, avoiding smoking, and breathing through the nose are recommended.

A shelter will protect one from potentially disastrous weather, help prevent hypothermia, and allow restful sleep. It will also boost how you feel emotionally, as it will become a base or home. Therefore, in typical survival situations, a shelter should be able to be moved with you, if possible, and be set up quickly. If one spends too much time on a shelter it takes away from other survival tasks.

Immovable rocks, animal nests, and other obstacles and hazards should be avoided. 

Dry watercourses may be flat, sandy, and comfortable to sleep on, but they will flood in a storm. 

Sunlight provides warmth (which is not always welcome), and can help one to wake up in the morning. However, sunny, open areas are vulnerable to wind which causes convection of one's body heat. 

Heat transfer: an excessively large or well-ventilated shelter will not retain warmth well. 

Flashing (weatherproofing) to provide protection from elements. 
A cave can provide a very useful shelter because it can provide protection from wind, rain and snow and maintains a constant internal temperature. Unfortunately, caves can present additional problems such as ground water, dampness, disease, and wildlife. Histoplasmosis, Blastomycosis, and Coccidiomycosis are several fungi found in caves that can infect the eyes and lungs of cavers. If bird or bat droppings are prevalent, you may want to find a different survival shelter to avoid these fungi. Bats often roost in caves and through their bite they can transmit rabies and other terminal illnesses. Bears also make dens in caves, so before you settle down in one, you should check it thoroughly for signs of inhabitance. 

The simplest and most mobile shelter is a tarp, supported by make-shift frame work or rope. Large leaves, such as ferns or fir branches, can be added to a latticework of branches. Ferns on a shelter provide insect repellent. Branches propped against a fallen tree make a simple and effective refuge, but animals such as ants and snakes may nest under the tree.

A more advanced shelter is known as a debris shelter, which can be constructed without modern tools or implements. It consists of a central ridge pole supported by two forked poles. This ridge pole supports a lattice of branches, which is then finished by leaves or other insulating material.

== Step One: prepare for something small. ==
{{TOC right}}
Survivability depends on what you know, how fit you are and available tools and resources. Fitness is the most important factor, if you are fit you can cope with mistakes and exert more effort to gather resources. The next important trait is having useful knowledge, this prevents making mistakes, reduces wasted energy and helps to keep moral up. It also serve to increase the chances of surviving without tools or resources. If you know how to improvise your own tools and locate water and food you have not only gained time but increased your value to others and you will have an advantage over any competition (including wildlife).

By having tools and resources you will be less dependent on others, reduce your movements/efforts and have something to bargain with if need arises, even for your life. Depending on the situation this can makes you also a bigger and slow target, especially if because of them you became static, for example not leaving your house amidst a flood or an epidemy because of excessive reliance/dependency on what you have stored. Balance is of the essence. 

=== Knowledge ===
Be aware and informed. What could be an usual emergency? Some emergencies are indeed expected to occur. It might be a flood, a hurricane, a tornado, or an earthquake. All this things have a distinct and knowable risk factor, even if unpredictable, some events are dependent on specific geographic location. Do you live near a river bed ? A atomic power plant ?

Knowing your surroundings and local risk factors will always help you be prepared and safer and should be also a factor for you daily decisions. Be aware of emergency plans for the area where you live, work or visit and learn the general actions that increase survivability in expected emergencies, like how to act in an earthquake or a tsunami.

Know your blood type, allergies, the basics of first aid, [[Knots|use knots]], learn how to swim and fish, to handle firearms and bows, to [[Automobile Repair|repair a car]] and drive it, ride a horse and bicycle. Get some camping experience, learn how to tie different utilitarian knots, create fire (especially using only wood), to meditate (or even [[w:Hypnosis|hypnosis]]). This are all tools that will increase your survivability and you do not need to physically carry with you.

=== Experience ===
There is no better thing that first person experience, this is the best way to not only learn but understand your limits and find new ways to solve unexpected problems. It will help everyone survive dangerous situations (such as storms or earthquakes), or in dangerous places (such as the desert, the mountains, and the jungle). Useful skills like lighting a fire, finding shelter, making water safe to drink, finding and identifying food, treating injuries, and climbing, swimming, and using specific or makeshift tools.

The more experience one has the more self confidence and keeping the moral up it is. In order to overcome the effects difficulty it is important to study and understand how stress may affect your action in both good and bad ways.

==== Backpacking ====
Having an understanding about your priorities, the needed supplies to address your requirements is extremely useful. Management of resources and deciding how and what to carry is a science in itself. There is a large quantity of books that deals exclusively with this subject directed to specific target audiences, in special to the habitual traveler but also for the wildlife experience. How and what to pack is a learning process that improves with experience.

Backpackers use lightweight equipment that can be carried long distances on foot, this may include a tent or shelter. Enabling a person to hike across the land, camping at remote spots. Backpacking equipment typically costs more that other type of equipment because of the materials used (resistance and weight) and the necessity of self reliability (like including their own power-supply).

==== Camping ====
Camping and other outdoor recreational activities are great to build self reliance and confidence. It can even provide the experience of being away from civilization. Camping may involve the use of a tent, a primitive structure, or no shelter at all.

Canoe camping is similar to backpacking, but uses canoes for transportation; much more weight and bulk can be carried in a canoe or kayak than in a backpack. Canoe camping is common in North America.

Anther form is the bicycle touring that combines camping with cycling. Where a bicycle is used to carry the gear and as the primary means of transportation, allowing greater distances to be covered than backpacking although less capacity for storage.

Motorcycle camping is more comparable to bicycle camping than car camping, due to the limited storage capacity of the motorbike. Motorcycle camping riders, as well as bicycle touring riders, often use some of the same equipment as backpackers, due to the lighter weights and compact dimensions associated with backpacking equipment.

&quot;Winter Camping&quot; refers to the experience of camping outside when there is sufficient snow on the ground. Some campers enjoy the challenge this form of recreation brings.

Wild Camping too, is a growing choice by people seeking the challenge of camping in the wilderness, without campsite amenities. It is a great way of enjoying the solitude and beauty of the wilderness in its most pure form. It falls into the survivalist experience.

==== Survivalists ====
Survivalist can be defined as experience campers that have learned the skills needed to survive out-of-doors in a situation of scarcity. It require skills in obtaining food from the wild, emergency medical treatments, orienteering, and pioneering.  Skills used on a more permanent basis, or as a component of daily life are referred to as bushcraft.

Campers and outdoors people have adapted their forms of camping and survival to suit extremely cold nights and limited mobility or evacuation. Methods of survival when winter camping include building snow shelters (quinzhees), dressing in &quot;layers,&quot; staying dry, using low-temperature sleeping bags, and fueling the body with appropriate food.

Practicers of this type of wilderness challenge face a different range of dangers. An environment may be dry, wet, hot, cold, high altitude, low altitude, desert, rural, urban, wilderness, subterranean, or an island. There are four basic necessities of life which apply in all of these cases: shelter, water, fire, and food. A fifth is oxygen for high altitudes and subterranean environments, and also specific survival situations such as drowning and landslide/avalanche.

Developments in outdoor equipment and pruning of survival techniques have skewed the scale towards man- if one is prepared, but there is nothing to replace experience in a survival situation.

===== Bushcraft =====
Bushcraft is a long-term extension of survival skills. A popular term for wilderness skills in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term was popularized in the northern hemisphere by Mors Kochanski and recently gained considerable currency in the United Kingdom due to the popularity of Ray Mears and his bushcraft and survival television programs.

Bushcraft is about surviving and thriving in the natural environment, and the acquisition of skills and knowledge to do so. Bushcraft includes all of the survivalist's skills but also includes more complex knowledge; firecraft, tracking, hunting, shelter building, the use of tools such as knives and axes, foraging, hand-carving wood, container construction from natural materials, rope and twine-making, and many others.

=== Fitness ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Things you should carry with you at any time ===
Strive to at all times carry simple items that in a SHTF situation may make you life easier.

One type of object that should normally be carried is small or dividable item of tradable value. For instance a bracelet or necklace of gold or silver can be easily hidden and designed so links can be loosen to permit smaller trades in case of need or be used as bait for fishing. Depending on the situation most other other items you carry can be used for trade, like a watch or even your shoes.

A good resistant belt, preferably longer than required. The belt buckler can also be a good tool beyond its primary function. Note that a belt can be a rapid way to create a tourniquet, to increase your reach or even to use as support in a zip line.

A time keeper, pressure resistant, non digital wrist-watch (or even better a chain-watch), that does not depend on batteries will be extremely helpfully and as seen above be an easily tradable item, it can also serve as a compass with the help of the sun, and will permit you to keep to a time table so to improve survivability.

For instance in a forest you may not be able to see the sun and in a survival situation you should keep night movement to a minimum, depending on the available light (moon, possibility to make and the duration of a torch) and expertize in night navigation, even in a desert environment where nights will be cooler, and movement easy, it may not be advisable. It may also help avoid the hours of the day that temperatures are higher.

A small and reliable knife, is extremely useful in any situation even in for day-to-day life, for instance in your key-chain. Not only useful as cutting tool or a possible weapon, the metal of the knife may also serve to create fire and serve as a crude mirror for signaling.

=== Things to plan at home ===
Your home should be your base in an emergency. Ownership of the property should be a priority so you have full legal control over it and in dire circumstances no one will be able to claim if from you.

Select a property that is not in a flood basin or too near a river (or any water course), if it is, check historic records for the area and see if you can build it (or if it already is) well above the flood line. Having at least one inflatable boat will also be optimal. Note that this type of location it will prevent you to rely on a well for fresh water since there is a high degree of contaminants that can already be present of the the natural water system or will be carried by any flood, as also make any food planting very susceptible to damage. Near the coast line you will have aggravated problems due to humidity and the presence of salt.

In a location with a high probability of heavy snow, at least one of the doors should open inward and preferably be in the 2-split format, this will prevent you becoming snowed in. Same is valid in areas prone to dense sandstorms. 

Assume 2-3 days without power and plan for that. This implies having three days of food that does not need cooking or refrigeration. Keep extra water put aside, flashlights, radio.

== Step Two: supplies add more ==
Planing for supplies is extremely important and constitutes an economical investment. Any item should be considered on the basis of its longevity, hardiness and usefulness.

Human survival priorities are found in the &quot;Rule of Three&quot;:
* Humans cannot survive more than three minutes without air (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
* Humans cannot survive more than three hours exposed to extreme low temperature 
* Humans cannot survive more than three days without water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
* Humans cannot survive more than three weeks without food

{{NOTE|The Rule of Three should be viewed as generalization. The record is 10 minutes, 17 seconds without air; the crew of a boat lasted 8 days without water; people have survived without food for over 40 days. In most survival situations, three priorities must be addressed before any other needs are met at the same time these same priorities may change depending upon environmental or situational factors.}}

There are also optimal times and locations to get your provisions for that special emergency or specialized material, consider that prices fluctuate with seasons for instance in the end of summer and winter season you can get good prices in sporting goods for the season that is ending.

{{:When It Hits the Fan/Generalities/Supplies}}

== Step Three: protection ==
Now you have something worth defend, something that others less prepared my be willing to fight you for. Huddling in the your &quot;cave&quot; fearing the unknown is an unsettling feeling. How does one combat this? Depending on your frame of mind, this is either the most frightening or most exciting part of preparedness steps, you will, in most events be dealing with the most dangerous animal on Earth, man.

In most locations and if not when involved in a catastrophic situations one may rely in the Police (or other state forces) since the event will not be  disruptive enough to make it impractical or place your personal security at a low priority, making you dire situation not particularly relevant in the general context of things.

Protection is a defensive stance, the tool-set may serve other purposes but consider this factor when you plan, since it is linked to what you have a need to protect. 

It is always best to be self reliant, by having a self sufficient strategy for active protection of your self, yours and your resources should be part of your survival strategy, this will help you fight off any intruder or scavenger be it human or beast.

{{:When It Hits the Fan/Generalities/Weapons}}

{{TODO|Focus in strategies especially archaic alarm systems.}}

{{BookCat}}

== Next... Reality Check ==
The most important factors for survival are shelter, water and food, by order of importance. In most situations if you are exposed you will be in danger from the involvement, be it hostile or not at the time you see yourself in dire straits. The sooner you find a safe place and establish the minimum to shelter you from the environment the better changes you will have.

The next priority is locating a water source, without water you will quickly become dehydrated and unable to function, water has also the property to reduce the sensation of hunger (especially if you can warm it).

The last step to become self sufficient is food. These are the three things that will have primal importance in any situation, being deprived of anyone of them will assuredly put your life in danger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Systems Life Cycle==

===System Life Cycle Stages===

The systems life cycle can be broken down into five stages: Analysis, Design, Implementation, Operation, and Maintenance. 

#'''Analysis''' - The system analyst meets with the users to determine exactly what the user wants, and undertake feasibility studies (whether it is possible for the designers to meet the user's expectations).  
#'''Design''' - In this stage, the programmers design a solution to the user's problem. This can be the most time-consuming part of the cycle, since there are many choices that need to be made. A decision must be made on the types of software, hardware and on the algorithms that are going to be used.    
#'''Implementation''' - The construction (development) of the system; the system is developed based on the design laid out in the previous stage.
#'''Operation''' - Also known as installation, or system launch. The system can be installed as a direct changeover, as a phased introduction, or as a parallel running.
#'''Maintenance''' - Bugs and/or flaws might arise with time, thus, the system will need to be fixed and updated. However, fixing one bug may lead to another bug being created.

===Importance Of Collecting Data===
Gathering data is essential in the analysis stage because you can gain clear insight into the problem. If the problem cannot be identified correctly, a poor solution is guaranteed to follow.

===Methods Of Data Collection===

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+ 
! Method !! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
! Interview 
| Detailed data, can change questions during process (not like questionnaire)
| Time-consuming, problems classifying/quantifying data
|-
! Questionnaire
| Can reach a lot of people, quickly (compared to interview/observation). Numerical analysis possible.
| Questions may be mis-interpreted. People may not respond at all or may do only some questions.
|-
! Document Search
| The data required for the system can be identified accurately.
| Documents may be lacking, out-of-date etc (interview could discover this).
|-
! Literature Search
| Can find descriptions/problems of previous implementations (saves work).
| Problem may not be described (or in detail). Again, working without experienced users.
|-
! Observation
| Observations are independent of user bias (unlike interview/questionnaire).
| Time consuming and observer can affect process: Hawthorne Effect.
|}

===Production of Requirement Specification===
A requirement specification contains what the system will be able to do and how it will be done. This should include:
*The costs of building, testing and running the system (including both hardware and software)
*Estimated time till completion
*List of hardware and software tools needed
*Description of hardware and software functions
*Performance of the system
*List of personnel and allocated tasks

===Feasibility Report===
A feasibility report can be produced during the analysis, design stage, or both. It should include:
*Cost
*Expected benefits
*Time period
*Potential difficulties

===Alternative Solutions===
There are a number of different ways a problem can be solved, with or without using a computer. One consideration you must take into account is the input and output of the solutions. The software itself could be one of three types:
*'''General Application Software''' - This is the least expensive solution but may not include all the features that the user requires. A typical example would be an office package.
*'''Specific Applications Packages''' - These are typically more expensive then general application software and provide a greater number of features. These programs tend to have been written specifically for business.
*'''Tailor Made Software''' - This is the most expensive option but can be customized to do exactly what the customer requires as it is written from scratch.

===Methods Of Testing Systems===
Systems usually go through several stages of testing. Alpha testing is the first stage in which asmall group of qualified individuals examine an early version of the program. Beta testing is when the program is fully featured an released to a wider audience for testing. 

Test data is also used to make sure the program outputs the expected data. We can test the program with:
*'''Normal Data''' - Data that is expected to be entered into the program. Including data at the limits of what is expected. 
*'''Extreme Data''' - This will be outside the normal limits of the program, simulating what happens if a user enters incorrect data by mistake.
*'''Abnormal Data''' - Data that is not expected, for example a string instead of an integer value.

===Methods Of Implementing New Systems===
A new system can be implemented in one of the following three ways:
*'''Parallel Running''' - This is when both new and old systems are run together. This confirms that they both produce the same outputs and if any faults occur they can be fixed with no up-time lost. Staff can be trained without fear of losing data, yet there may be twice as much work to do.
*'''Phased Introduction''' - Parts of the system are implemented at different times, each part is then tested and confirmed, this means it will take much longer to implement.
*'''Direct Changeover''' - Also known as a ''Big Bang'', the old system is immediately replaced by the new one. Users need to be trained before the new system is implemented and there is a risk that it will not work correctly.

===Importance Of Maintaining Systems===
Proper maintenance of a system is essential; clear documentation to begin with helps this progress as programmers will not need to work hard to understand design decision if they are explained in documentation. This reduces the cost of maintanence. Periodic reviews and performance reviews use the same data collection techniques as seen in the analysis sections and indicate whether further improvements or modifications are needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==System Analysis==
===Importance of Formulating A Problem Precisely===
In order to create a good solution it is vital to understand what the problem is, so that the solutions are all focused towards it. There might be team of specialists that work on the problem; and all of them must be fully concerned about the issue. Furthermore the user of the system often knows the matter perfectly and he must be interviewed so that he can provide a good description of his requirements. There is also an economic concern, since the cost of the system is directly proportional to the benefits it will provide, all this information should then be written in a feasibility report. Lastly the most important thing of all; a system must be tested continuously to see if  it satisfies all the requests, it is not possible to test a system without knowing what it was supposed to do.

===Aspects In A Considered Problem===

Various aspects are to be considered in finding a solution to a specific problem. This initial phase of analysis in systems can also be called ''fact finding''. The reasons for this analysis are for the purpose of determining what aspects of the problem can be solved by computer means, what solutions have been used in the past to solve a similar problem, or what the costs may be in generating a new solution. Additionally information can be found such as how much time it may take to install a new system, and the responsibilities given to various persons in the development team. 

All of the information that must be obtained, as described above, can be found through conducting interviews, or sending out questionnaires to employees in a company for example. The development team may also look up a history of the organization to see what information is available about the current system through existing documents. Research into other sources with different solutions to a similar problem and the observation of employees working under the existing system can also be investigated. Obviously, these methods of analysis are used at the development team's discretion, since they all have advantages and disadvantages (see topic 1.2.3 for more)

===Outcomes===
It is likely that after the analysis stage a number of possible solutions will be made. Therefore a decision will need to be made on which is the most suitable solution and whether it is worth making the change.

If the decision is to go ahead with the change a detailed plan must be produced, tasks must be allocated, and a feasibility report must be created.

===Parts That Can Be Solved Using A Computer===
Not all problems that can be solved with a computer are feasible or cost effective once both hardware and software constraints have been taken into account.

===Three Basic Control Aspects===
In general, the three basic control aspects of the system will be:
*Input
*Process
*Output

===Analysation By Modules===
Modular decomposition breaks down the problem into smaller components. We usually find the modules deal with inputs, processes and outputs.

===Parts Of A System===

The main parts of any computer system follow the input-process-output model of data flow:

[[File:Input Processes and Outputs.jpg]]

However, hardware also needs backing storage, as there is no permanent storage in the CPU:

[[File:Inputs Processes and Outputs for Hardware.jpg]]

Layers of software have also been implemented, so no direct contact with hardware is necessary:

[[File:Layers in computer systems.jpg]]

===Data in a System===

When data is in a system it is often shown in flow diagrams with the following symbols:

[[Image:DataFlow.jpg]]

===Data Capture and Output Presentation===

*Data Capture
**Manual Data Entry - Keyboard, mouse (Example: adding client records to a database)
**Direct Data Entry - OCR/OMR scanners, barcode scanner etc (Example: Lending a book or locating borrower details)
**Automatic Data Entry - Sensors (Example: automatic temperature control)

*Data Presentation
**Temporary Displays - VDU, LCD Display (Example: showing a price on a display)
**Permanent Display - Printer (Example: a receipt)
**Electrical/Mechanical Output - Actuator (Example: Sending credit card data from a bank to a cash machine)

===Design Data Structures===

===Hardware Components===

===Suitable Interface===
The major two user interfaces are command line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI).

CLI's are much easier to implement and use less memory, however there is a much greater learning curve, yet long-term users may find them quicker than other interfaces.

GUI's are much more complex to implement and use more memory, they also require a mouse. Yet, icons make it easier to remember commands and these are grouped in menus. There is a much smaller learning curve. GUI's can also be referred to as 'WIMP' (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Life Cycle==

===Major Stages===

You should outline the major stages in the software life cycle.
One model includes: system analysis, leading to a precise statement of the problem that needs solving (a requirements specification); software design; program construction, including testing and debugging; installation and operation; and maintenance.
Other models are acceptable, as long as they emphasize the cyclical nature of the life cycle.

===Cyclical nature of software production===
Computers systems are used over long periods of time. The software in these systems requires periodic improvement. After the original design and implementation, further analysis, redesign and restructuring are required to accommodate changing needs. This will continue through many cycles of analysis, design, implementation and use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Design==

===Data Required===

===Modularity===
Modularity is a concept that has applications in the contexts of computer science, particularly programming, as well as cognitive science in investigating the structure of mind. A module can be defined variously, but generally must be a component of a larger system, and operate within that system independently from the operations of the other components.

'''Modularity in Computer Science'''

Modularity is the property of computer programs that measures the extent to which they have been composed out of separate parts called modules. A modular approach to programming is gaining popularity in fields of artificial intelligence systems integration, where a large-scale general A.I. system is composed of modules that each serve a specific purpose and communicate with each other to produce the system's overall behavior.
Programs that have many direct interrelationships between any two random parts of the program code are less modular than programs where those relationships occur mainly at well-defined interfaces between modules.

===Prototyping===
Prototyping is the process of quickly putting together a working model (a prototype) in order to test various aspects of a design, illustrate ideas or features and gather early user feedback. Prototyping is often treated as an integral part of the system design process, where it is believed to reduce project risk and cost. Often one or more prototypes are made in a process of incremental development where each prototype is influenced by the performance of previous designs, in this way problems or deficiencies in design can be corrected. When the prototype is sufficiently refined and meets the functionality, robustness, manufacturability and other design goals, the product is ready for production.

''see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototyping prototyping] for a more detailed explaination''

===Prototyping Approach===

===End Users===

The end user is a popular concept in software engineering, referring to an abstraction of the group of persons who will ultimately operate a piece of software (i.e. the expected user or target-user).
This abstraction is meant to be useful in the process of designing the user interface, and is therefore built on a relevant subset of any user's characteristics which may include which computer interfaces he/she is comfortable with (having used them before or because of their inherent simplicity), his/her technical expertise and degree of knowledge in specific fields or disciplines, and any other information which is believed to be relevant in a specific project.
When little constraints are imposed on the end-user category, i.e. when writing/publishing programs for the general public, it is common practice to expect minimal technical expertise or previous training in the use of computer interfaces. This is also the general meaning associated with the term end user (see also Luser). In this context, intuitive GUIs (possibly with a touch interface) are usually preferred over more sophisticated command line interfaces for the sake of usability.

===Efficiency===

For Standard Level, only a qualitative treatment or a specific calculation of the efficiency is expected. &quot;O&quot; or BigO notation is required only at HL.

===Debugging===

Testing implies tracing sections of an algorithm, including responses to errors (&quot;dry runs&quot;), as well as the design of test cases, which are then executed. Students must be able to propose suitable test data, and give reasons. 
Debugging has the components of detecting, diagnosing and correcting errors shown up by testing.

===Tools Of Debugging===

Ideally, students should use an integrated development environment (IDE) combining an editor, interpreter or compiler and debugging tools, but this is not a requirement.

===Need Of Documentation===
It will be very important that the documentation supplied with the original system is clear and complete. This documentation will be used to make it easier to design modifications to the system.

===Features For Design===

===Features For User===

It is required to write end-user instructions according to the standards described in the guidelines for the program dossier. Still, other user manuals may be needed (for example, on-line help systems and installations manuals where systems are installed by personnel other than end-users).

===Flow===
Flow is a theoretical concept proposed by psychologist [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]]. It postulates that  when difficulty of task is matched to the skill of the person doing it, a state of &quot;flow&quot; is reached. (citation needed)

'''[[Marchese]] Guglielmo Marconi''' [gu{{IPA|ʎ'ʎ}}e:lmo mar'ko:ni] ([[25 April]] [[1874]] - [[20 July]] [[1937]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] inventor, best known for his development of a [[radio]]telegraph system, which served as the foundation for the establishment of numerous affiliated companies worldwide. He shared the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]], &quot;in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org, &quot;''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Guglielmo Marconi: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1909]''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Marconi was an active [[Italian fascism|Italian Fascist]]&lt;ref&gt;Physicsworld.com, &quot;''[http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/14/12/7 Guglielmo Marconi: radio star]''&quot;, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[apologist]] for [[Fascism and ideology|their ideology]] (such as the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|attack by Italian forces in Ethiopia]]).

==Radio work==
During his early years, Marconi had an interest in science and [[electricity]]. One of the scientific developments during this era came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, beginning in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]&amp;mdash;now generally known as &quot;radio waves&quot;, at the time more commonly called &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; or &quot;aetheric waves&quot;. Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries, and a renewed interest on the part of Marconi. He was permitted to briefly study the subject under [[Augusto Righi]], a [[University of Bologna]] physicist who had done research on Hertz's work.

===Early experimental devices===
Marconi began to conduct experiments, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in [[Pontecchio]], Italy. His goal was to use radio waves to create a practical system of &quot;[[wireless telegraphy]]&quot;&amp;mdash;i.e. the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea&amp;mdash;numerous investigators had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies for over 50 years, but none had proven commercially successful. Marconi ''did not'' discover any new and revolutionary principle in his wireless-telegraph system, but rather he assembled and improved an array of facts, unified and adapted them to his system.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, H. S., &amp; Williams, E. H. (1910). ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=06W82x_i0PiNVhgY4to&amp;id=ti8KAAAAIAAJ Every-day science]''. New York: Goodhue Company. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Marconi's system had the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Marconi delineated his 1895 apparatus in his Nobel Award speech. See: Marconi, &quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1909.]&quot; Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901-1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196-222. Page 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A relatively simple [[oscillator]], or [[spark-gap transmitter|spark producing]] radio transmitter, which was closely modeled after one designed by Righi, in turn similar to what Hertz had used;
* A wire or capacity area placed at a height above the ground; 
* A [[coherer]] receiver, which was a modification of [[Edouard Branly]]'s original device, with refinements to increase sensitivity and reliability;
* A [[telegraph key]] to operate the transmitter to send short and long pulses, corresponding to the dots-and-dashes of [[Morse code]]; and
* A telegraph register, activated by the coherer, which recorded the received Morse code dots and dashes onto a roll of paper tape.

Similar configurations using spark-gap transmitters plus coherer-receivers had been tried by others, but many were unable to achieve transmission ranges of more than a few hundred metres. This was not the case for all researchers in the field of the wireless arts, though. &lt;ref&gt;In the beginning of 1894, [[Nikola Tesla]] was transmitting to a distance of 50 miles from New York City to West Point. See the PBS website, &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html Marconi and Tesla: Who invented radio?]&quot; (ed. this is noted as having been accomplished in Leland's book concerning Tesla's &quot;Work with Alternating Currents&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leland I. Anderson, Priority in the Invention of Radio — Tesla vs. Marconi, Antique Wireless Association monograph, 1980, examining the 1943 decision by the US Supreme Court holding the key Marconi patent invalid (9 pages). (21st Century Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Marconi could only signal over limited distances. In the summer of 1895 he moved his experimentation outdoors. After increasing the length of the transmitter and receiver antennas, and arranging them vertically, and positioning the antenna so that it touched the ground, the range increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt; This fact was known to many as, in 1893, Tesla stated in the widely known   &quot;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1893-02-24.htm On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena]&quot; speech which was delivered before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, in February, and before the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, in March, that &quot;''One of the terminals of the source would be connected to Earth'' [as a electric ground connection ...] ''the other to an insulated body of large surface''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Marconi may not have understood until later the reason, the &quot;ground connections&quot; allowed the earth to act as a [[waveguide]] [[resonator]] for the [[surface wave]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi did acknowledge this later in his Nobel Award speech. See: Marconi, &quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1909.]&quot; Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901-1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196-222. Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;) Soon he was able to transmit signals over a hill, a distance of approximately 1.5 kilometres (1 mile). By this point he concluded that with additional funding and research, a device could become capable of spanning greater distances and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily.

Finding limited interest in his work in Italy, in early 1896 at the age of 21, Marconi traveled to [[London]], [[England]], accompanied by his mother to seek support for his work. (Marconi spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) While there, he gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the British Post Office. The apparatus that Marconi possessed at that time was strikingly similar to that of one in 1882 by [[Amos Dolbear|A. E. Dolbear]], of [[Tufts College]], which used a spark coil generator and a [[Crystal detectors|carbon granular rectifier]] for reception.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Thomas Story, ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0_BNls1ruTf5Rr6WD5&amp;id=qFMbsXGH8pYC The Story of Wireless Telegraphy]''. 1904. Page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John J. O'Neill, ''Prodigal Genius:The Life of Nikola Tesla''. Ives Washburn, New York, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; A series of demonstrations for the British government followed&amp;mdash;by March, 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about 6 kilometres (4 miles) across the [[Salisbury Plain]]. On [[13 May]] [[1897]], Marconi sent the first ever wireless communication over water. It transversed the [[Bristol Channel]] from [[Lavernock Point]] ([[South Wales]]) to [[Flat Holm]] Island, a distance of 14 kilometres (8.7 miles). The message read &quot;Are you ready&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, &quot;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Impressed by these and other demonstrations, Preece introduced Marconi's ongoing work to the general public at two important London lectures: &quot;Telegraphy without Wires&quot;, at the [[Toynbee Hall]] on [[11 December]] [[1896]]; and &quot;Signalling through Space without Wires&quot;, given to the [[Royal Institute]] on [[4 June]] [[1897]].

Numerous additional demonstrations followed, and Marconi began to receive international attention. In July, 1897 he carried out a series of tests at [[La Spezia]] in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyds between [[Ballycastle]] and [[Rathlin Island]], [[Ireland]], was conducted on [[6 July]], [[1898]]. The [[English channel]] was crossed on [[27 March]] [[1899]], from [[Wimereux]], [[France]] to [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], England, and in the fall of 1899, the first demonstrations in the United States took place, with the reporting of the [[America's Cup]] international yacht races at New York. According to the ''Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute'' by the [[United States Naval Institute]], the Marconi instruments were tested around 1899 and the tests concerning his wireless system found that the &quot;[...] coherer, principle of which was discovered some twenty years ago, [was] the only electrical instrument or device contained in the apparatus that is at all new&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;United States Naval Institute, ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0X69Ty10xaRE_L8yAr&amp;id=egEjvWjbCQgC Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute]''. The Institute, 1899. Page 857.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transatlantic transmissions===
[[Image:Marconi at newfoundland.jpg|center|thumb|555px|Marconi watching associates raise kite antenna at St. John's, December, 1901]]
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:115%&quot;&gt;{{rquote|right|See if you can hear anything, Mr. Kemp!&lt;ref&gt;Page, Walter Hines, and Arthur Wilson Page, The World's Work. Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1908. Page 9625&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;
Around the [[turn of the century]], Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s. Marconi soon made the announcement that on [[12 December]] [[1901]], using a 152.4 m (500 foot) kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of [[Canada]]) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]]. The distance between the two points was about 3,500 kilometres (2,100 miles). Heralded as a great scientific advance, there was -- and continues to be -- some skepticism about this claim, partly because the signals had been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmission, consisting of the Morse code letter ''S'' sent repeatedly were difficult to discern from atmospheric noise. (A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/radio/radio_differences.html Fessenden and Marconi: Their Differing Technologies and Transatlantic Experiments During the First Decade of this Century]&lt;/ref&gt; The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/74/28992/01305565.pdf Marconi and the History of Radio]''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John S.

International Conference on 100 Years of Radio -- 5-7 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage operated at lower voltage and provided the energy for the second stage to spark at a higher voltage. [[Nikola Tesla]], a rival in transalantic transmission, stated after being told of Marconi's reported transmission that &quot;Marconi [... was] using seventeen of [[List of Tesla patents|my patents]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, ''Tesla, Man Out of Time'', New Jersey : Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth, ''Tesla: Master of Lightning'', Barnes&amp;Noble, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling challenged by [[Scientific skepticism|skeptics]], Marconi prepared a better organized and documented test. In February, 1902, the [http://www.purplesky.co.uk/sources/photos/00061.jpg SS ''Philadelphia''] sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced coherer-tape reception up to 2,496 kilometres (1,551 miles), and audio reception up to 3,378 kilometres (2,099 miles). Interestingly, the maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that for [[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions, radio signals travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had only been received up to about 1,125 kilometres (700 miles), less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists's  belief they were essentially limited to line-of-sight distances.

On [[17 December]] [[1902]], a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada, became the first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. On [[18 January]] [[1903]], a Marconi station built near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts]] in 1901 sent a message of greetings from [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.

Marconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904 a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radiotelegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907 between [[Clifden]] Ireland and [[Glace Bay]], but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide reliable communication.

===''Titanic''===
The two radio operators aboard the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] were not employed by the [[White Star Line]] but by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company. Following the sinking of the ocean liner, survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|''Carpathia'']]. When it docked in New York, Marconi went aboard with a reporter from the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Eaton &amp; Charles A. Haas ''Titanic - Triumph and Tragedy, A Chronicle in Words and Pictures''. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1912, Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Titanic regarding the marine telegraphy's functions and the procedures for emergencies at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Inquiry ''Loss of the S.S. Titanic'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent disputes===
:&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;''Main articles: [[invention of radio]] and [[history of radio]].&lt;/div&gt;

Marconi's work built upon the discoveries of numerous other scientists and experimenters. His original &quot;two-circuit&quot; equipment, consisting of a spark-gap transmitter plus a coherer-receiver, was similar to those used by other experimenters, and in particular to that employed by [[Oliver Lodge]] in a series of widely reported demonstrations in 1894. There were claims that Marconi was able to signal for greater distances than anyone else when using the spark-gap and coherer combination, but these have been disputed (notably by [[Tesla]]).&lt;ref&gt;

Marconi’s late-1895 transmission of signals was for around a mile. This was small compared to Tesla's early-1895 transmissions of up to 50 miles. For more see &quot;Nikola Tesla On His Work with Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power&quot;, Leland I. Anderson, Twenty First Century Books, 2002, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]] stated to the Congress of Russian Electrical Engineers that: &quot;[...]'' the emission and reception of signals by Marconi by means of electric oscillations ''[was]'' nothing new. In America, the famous engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] carried the same experiments in 1893''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Guglielmo Marconi Case;  [http://www.mercury.gr/tesla/marcen.html Who is the True Inventor of Radio]''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Fascist Party|Fascist regime]] in [[Italy]] credited Marconi with the first improvised arrangement in the development of radio.&lt;ref&gt; Gianni Isola, &quot;Italian radio: History and Historiography&quot;; Special Issue: ''Italian Media Since World War II''. ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'',  August, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy whether his contribution was sufficient to deserve patent protection, or if his devices were too close to the original ones developed by Hertz, Popov, Branley, Tesla, and Lodge to be patentable.

While Marconi did pioneering demonstrations for the time, his equipment was  limited by being essentially untuned, which greatly restricted the number of ''spark-gap'' radio transmitters which could operate simultaneously in a geographical area without causing mutually disruptive interference. (Continuous-wave transmitters were naturally more selective and less prone to this deficiency). Marconi addressed this defect with a patent application for a much more sophisticated &quot;four-circuit&quot; design, which featured two tuned-circuits at both the transmitting and receiving antennas. This was issued as British patent number 7,777 on [[26 April]] [[1900]]. However, this patent came after significant earlier work had been done on electrical tuning by [[Nikola Tesla]]. (As a defensive move, in 1911 the Marconi Company purchased the Lodge-Muirhead Syndicate, whose primary asset was Oliver Lodge's 1897 tuning patent.) Thus, the &quot;four-sevens&quot; patent and its equivalents in other countries was the subject of numerous legal challenges, with rulings which varied by jurisdiction, from full validation of Marconi's tuning patent to complete nullification.

In 1943, a lawsuit regarding Marconi's numerous other radio patents was resolved in the United States. The court decision was based on the prior work conducted by others, including [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Oliver Lodge]], and [[John Stone Stone]], from which some of Marconi patents (such as {{US patent|763772}}) stemmed. The U. S. Supreme Court stated that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Tesla patent No. 645,576, applied for September 2, 1897 and allowed March 20, 1900, disclosed a four-circuit system, having two circuits each at transmitter and receiver, and recommended that all four circuits be tuned to the same frequency. [... He] recognized that his apparatus could, without change, be used for wireless communication, which is dependent upon the transmission of electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;''[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/popov/sentenza.html Marconi Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States]''&quot;. 320 U.S. 1. Nos. 369, 373. Argued April 9-12, 1943. Decided June 21, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In making their decision, the court noted, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marconi's reputation as the man who first achieved successful radio transmission rests on his original patent, which became reissue No. 11,913, and which is not here [320 U.S. 1, 38] in question. That reputation, however well-deserved, does not entitle him to a patent for every later improvement which he claims in the radio field. Patent cases, like others, must be decided not by weighing the reputations of the litigants, but by careful study of the merits of their respective contentions and proofs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court also stated that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well established that as between two inventors priority of invention will be awarded to the one who by satisfying proof can show that he first conceived of the invention''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case was resolved in the U.S. Supreme Court by overturning most of Marconi's patents. At the time, the [[United States Army]] was involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with Marconi's company regarding radio, leading observers to posit that the government nullified Marconi's other patents to render moot claims for compensation (as, it is speculated, the government's initial reversal to grant Marconi the patent right in order to nullify any claims Tesla had for compensation). In contrast to the United States system, Mr. Justice Parker of the British High Court of Justice upheld Marconi's &quot;four-sevens&quot; tuning patent. These proceedings made up only a part of a long series of legal struggles, as major corporations jostled for advantage in a new and important industry.

Over the years, the Marconi companies gained a reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could only be used for radiotelegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with [[continuous-wave]] transmissions, which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). In 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter, the [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]] Marconi factory was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the United Kingdom&amp;mdash;one of these featured Dame [[Nellie Melba]]. In 1922 regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Writtle]].

{{rquote|right|His Excellency the Senator Marchese Guglielmo Marconi, president of the Royal Academy of Italy, Member of the Fascist Grand Council}}&lt;/div&gt; 
In 1914 Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Italian Senate]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in the UK. During [[World War I]], Italy joined the Allied side of the conflict, and Marconi was placed in charge of the Italian military's radio service. In 1924, he was made a ''[[marchese]]'' by King [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. 

Marconi joined the [[Italian fascism|Italian Fascist]] party in 1923. In 1930, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] appointed him President of the [[Accademia d'Italia]], which made Marconi a member of the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Fascist Grand Council]]. Marconi was a participant in rallies that fostered fascist beliefs and composed fascist propaganda. Marconi also made speeches as an apologist for the actions of the fascist regime in Italy. 

In 1935, Italian forces [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|occupied]] the African nation of [[Ethiopia]], resulting in near universal condemnation of Italy. Marconi made numerous radio speeches supporting the unprovoked attack, notorious enough that the BBC banned him from speaking on the subject. Marconi was pro-war in the era between the First and Second World War, and he was condemned for such beliefs by many.&lt;ref&gt;EPN, &quot;''[http://www.epn-online.com/page/20084/the-unseen-marconi-get-involved-.html The Unseen Marconi]''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marconi died in Rome in 1937 at age 63, and Italy held a state funeral for Marconi. As a tribute, all radio stations throughout the world observed two minutes of silence. His remains are housed in the Villa Griffone at [[Sasso Marconi]], [[Emilia-Romagna]], which assumed that name in his honour in 1938.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An engineer has to keep in mind that every device he or she creates will eventually fail.  Catastrophic failure should be avoided by all means since this could result in injury or even death. Some main causes of engineering failures are insufficient knowledge, underestimation of influence and ignorance or negligence.

In this chapter some examples of catastrophic failure are given. By studying these examples the engineer can learn how to avoid failure in his or her designs.

==Examples of engineering failures==

===&lt;u&gt;Patriot&lt;/u&gt;===

On February 25, 1991, during the Gulf War, an American Patriot Missile in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#Failure_at_Dhahran]. The result of this failure was the death of 28 US soldiers.

====Problem====

The cause of the problem is located in the computer responsible for the tracking calculations of the incoming Scud missile. This computer keeps time as an integer value in units of tenths of a second, and stores it in registers of 24 bits long. Afterwards, this value is multiplied by a fixed-point 24-bit representation of 0.1 to obtain a 48-bit floating-point value of time in seconds.

The failure is caused by the 24-bit representation of 0.1 in base 2. The base 2 representation of 0.1 is nonterminating: 0.0001100110011001100110011001100....  The 24 bit register in the Patriot stored instead 0.00011001100110011001100 introducing an error of 0.0000000000000000000000011001100... binary, or about 0.000000095 decimal. This means the accuracy of the time is reduced by 0.0001%.

However, the tracking of a missile doesn’t depend on the absolute clock-time, but rather on the time that elapsed between two different radar pulses. Since this time difference is very small, the error of 0.0001% is truly insignificant. This doesn’t explain the deviation of the Patriot missile, but there is a second problem.

The software used by the computer was written in assembly language 20 years ago. It was updated several times to cope with the high speed of ballistic missiles, for which the system was not originally designed. One of these updates contained a subroutine to convert clock-time more accurately into floating-point. However, the subroutine was not inserted at every point where it was needed. Hence, with a less accurate truncated time of one radar pulse being subtracted from a more accurate time of another radar pulse, the error no longer cancelled.

At the time the Scud missile arrived, the computer had been active 100 hours, so the calculated elapsed time had an error of 0.000000095×100×60×60×10=0.34 seconds. A Scud travels at about 1676 meters per second, and so travels more than half a kilometer in this error time. This was far enough for the incoming Scud to be outside the &quot;range gate&quot; of the Patriot.

====Solution====

The solution to this problem was already suggested before the accident. Increase the accuracy of the time representation, by the use of more bits. However, this solution avoids the problem from happening, but doesn’t solve it. If the computer is activated for years without rebooting, the same failure can still occur.

There is a better approach. Simply measure the relative time between the two radar pulses. The clock should always be reset at the first pulse and stopped at the second pulse. This avoids the subtraction of two almost identical big numbers, and its numerical problem.  

====Lesson====

* An algorithm where big numbers are subtracted from each other should be rewritten to avoid this loss of numerical accuracy.
* It’s important to analyze the number of bits used to represent physical parameters, i.e. time, in the design.
* The system designer needs very detailed specifications of all the components he uses.

===&lt;u&gt;Mars Pathfinder&lt;/u&gt;===

On July 4th 1997, [[w: Mars_Pathfinder |the Mars Pathfinder]] successfully set foot on the Martian surface. However, a few days after the start of its mission, the vehicle started losing information due to several system resets. The cause of this problem was located in the embedded systems kernel used in the Pathfinder.

====Problem====

The tasks of the spacecraft are executed as threads with priorities, reflecting the urgency of each task. There are 3 types of threads:

* high priority threads, i.e. the bus management task. 
* medium priority threads, i.e. the communications task.
* low priority threads, i.e. the meteorological data gathering task.

During execution of the bus management task, it will move data in and out of the information bus (the bus that connects all the components of the spacecraft). Access to this bus is synchronized with [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Operating systems#Inter process communication | mutexes]]. The meteorological data gathering task uses the information bus to publish its data. When publishing, it acquires a mutex, writes to the bus, and releases the mutex. Using the mutexes guaranties that each bus thread waits until the previous one is finished.

Normally, the threads system with priorities and the bus management with mutexes works fine. However, a problem known as [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Design Patterns#Problems of real time programming | priority inversion]] can occur. Assume that a medium priority communications task is scheduled while the high priority bus management task is blocked waiting for the low priority meteorological data thread. The communications task, having higher priority than the meteorological task, would prevent it from running, consequently preventing the blocked bus management task from running.  Since the communications task is a long-running task, a [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Real Time Operating systems#Watchdog timers | watchdog timer]] will eventually go off, noticing that the data bus task had not been executed for some time. The watchdog task will conclude that something had gone wrong, and initiate a total system reset. This reset is comparable to a home computer reboot; it clears the registers so that the system can restart without errors.

====Solution====

There are several solutions available for this problem. One of these is called [[w: Priority_inheritance|priority inheritance]]. The meteorological thread will inherit the priority of the bus management task, causing it be scheduled with higher priority than the communications task.

Fortunately, VxWorks contains a C language interpreter intended to allow developers to type in C expressions and functions to be executed on the fly during system debugging. After uploading the right program to change the software of the spacecraft, the problem was solved.

It’s important to realize that priority inheritance is not the best solution to this problem. In complex systems, with dozens of bus tasks interacting, all the tasks will eventually obtain highest priority, and the problem remains. However, in case of the Pathfinder, it sufficed.

====Lesson====

* Coordinate tasks by the use of priorities is not the best approach. This indirect way gives the scheduler all responsibility. It’s better to include the coordination in the system itself [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Asynchronous_activities]. 
* It is important to provide support to intervene when unforeseen errors occur.  
** the watchdog: every ECS should contain a watchdog task, because a system block can never be excluded.
** debugging facilities in the field: without the ability to modify the system in the field, the problem could not have been corrected.
* It is not possible to test every situation completely. If timing (coordination) is important, the amount of bytes is important,…, debugging can always be necessary. 
* Good theory is important: the theoretical solution for this problem was presented in a paper many years ago.
* Correctness is important: the engineer's initial analysis that &quot;the data bus task executes very frequently and is time-critical -- we shouldn't spend the extra time in it to perform priority inheritance&quot; was wrong. It is precisely in such time critical and important situations where correctness is very important, even at some additional performance cost.


===&lt;u&gt;Ariane 5 Flight 501&lt;/u&gt;===

The[[w:Ariane_5_Flight_501| Ariane 5, Flight 501]], was launched on June 4, 1996 and was the first unsuccessful European test flight. Due to a malfunction in the control software, the rocket veered off its flight path 37 seconds after launch 
and was destroyed by its automated self-destruct system when high aerodynamic forces caused the core of the vehicle to disintegrate. It is one of the most infamous [[w:Computer_bug|computer bugs]] in history. What could be the reason behind the sudden change in flight path of the first flight of the Ariane 5? Certainly, reusing similar software code as in the previous [[w:Ariane_4| Ariane 4]] project without simulating was a big mistake.

====Problem====

An operand error occurred due to an unexpected high value of an internal alignment function result called BH, Horizontal Bias, related to the horizontal velocity sensed by the platform. This value is calculated as an indicator for alignment precision over time. The value of BH was much higher than expected because the early part of the trajectory of Ariane 5 differs from that of Ariane 4 and results in considerably higher horizontal velocity values. An internal software exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from [[w: Floating_point |64-bit floating point]] to [[w:16-bit|16-bit]] signed integer value. The floating point number which was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. This resulted in the operand error, causing the on-board computer to send diagnostic data instead of real flight data. This diagnostic data commanded sudden nozzle deflections and induced a high [[w: Angle_of_attack |angle of attack]]. (for more detailed information, see [http://www.cs.unibo.it/~laneve/papers/ariane5rep.html Report paper Ariane5])

====Solution====

A simulation of the whole trajectory ([[w: Static_code_analysis |static code analysis]]) should have pointed out the overflow error immediately. This step should have been performed at the stage of architectural design or implementation (prototyping) within the design process. 

====Lesson====

This example illustrates the dramatic consequences of a data overflow software failure, whereby the onboard computer only received diagnostic information instead of realistic flight data. Although there was a back-up system of the failing part apparent in the Ariane5, failure could not be prevented because the backup system used the same software code. 
Some lessons came forward after the disaster with flight 501 happened: 

* Prepare a test facility including as much real equipment as technically feasible, inject realistic input data, and perform ''complete'' and closed-loop [[w: Software_testing |testing]] of the ''total'' system: Although a (software) subsystem worked perfectly on a previous embedded control system, it can still fail as a subsystem in a new embedded system, i.e.: Always question the ''reusability'' of a subsystem. In this case software failed on the Ariane5 whereas it worked very well on the previous [[w: Ariane_4 |Ariane4]] rocket! After the accident, a static code analysis painfully showed the overflow.
See the [[#Therac]]-25 for another failure due to reusing software.
* A sensor has to return reliable data in all circumstances: In this case, the IRS (Inertial Reference System) returned diagnostic data instead of real flight data because of a data overflow of a 16 bit signed integer value. In some cases it should be better that the sensor returns nothing at all (or just a warning sign) instead of unreliable data.
* The high risks associated with complex computing systems took the attention of the general public, politicians, and [[w: Corporate_officer| executives]], resulting in increased support for research on ensuring the reliability of safety-critical systems. The subsequent automated analysis of the Ariane code was the first example of large-scale [[w: Static_code_analysis |static code analysis]] by [[w: Abstract_interpretation | abstract interpretation]].

Note: ''In practice there should always be a trade off between safety, economic, ([[w: Ecodesign|environmental]]) ,... aspects. For example: In the above example the sensor is a critical component to safely put the astronauts back on the planet, whereas a sensor as part of a conveyer belt system is much less life-threatening. Typically, safety is of most priority at the [[w:Aviation|aviation]], aerospace and [[w: Nuclear_fusion|nuclear]] sector!''


===&lt;u&gt;The Space Shuttle Challenger&lt;/u&gt;===

On his 10th flight into space, the [[w:Space_Shuttle_Challenger|Space shuttle Challenger]] disintegrated 73 seconds after take off. 7 astronauts died. The cause of this failure was not only mechanical but also psychological, the so called [[w: Groupthink |groupthink]]!

====Problem ====

Officials of he NASA team decided to launch the spacecraft while ignoring admonitions of the engineers with a sense of invulnerability, given the successful history of NASA. The team worked closely together for a long time and they were under intense pressure  to launch the shuttle without further delay that they all collectively went  along with the launch decision. Engineers however knew that the rubber sealing (an [[w: O-ring |O-ring]]) of the propellant rocket wasn't functioning optimal under freezing temperatures. The cold temperature on the 28th Januar 1986, causing a leakage of heat flow along the O-ring therefore was the avoidable origin of the death of 7 human beings.

====Lesson====

This example shows a hardware failure mode: the effect of temperature on the deformation of material. All components of a system can work perfectly together in most of the cases, but fail in bad [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hostile_Environment|environmental conditions]], such as the freezing conditions in this case.&lt;br&gt;
An other important conclusion comes forward. A bad design isn't always the only cause of failures. Also psychological aspects matters. This is where the engineer has to be critical in all circumstances and not collapse under [[w: Peer_pressure |peer pressure]]. Especially at the stage of usage of an embedded control system, operators have to check whether the environmental conditions fall within the design characteristics before starting up the system. Failures because of such psychological aspects are often hard to overcome and can be seen as an [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Failure_modes_and_prevention#operational|operational failure cause]].


===&lt;u&gt;Corrosion disasters&lt;/u&gt;===

Corrosion is often a hard to fight ''hardware failure mode''. Many times disasters happen when materials collapse because of corrosion. Two of them are given below:

*Sinking of the [[w:MV_Erika|Erika]]:
Erika was the name of a tanker built in 1975 and sank 70 km from the coast of France on December 13, 1999.Tons of heavy fuel oil ended up in middle of the sea, causing one of the greatest environmental disasters in the world. The ''economic consequences'' of the incident have been dramatically felt across the region: a drop in the income from tourism, loss of income from fishing, and a ban on the trade of sea products including oysters and crabs have added to the discomfort.

Corrosion problems had been apparent on the Erika since at least 1994. In addition, there were numerous deficiencies in her firefighting and inert gas systems, causing explosion risks. [[w:Lloyd's_List|Lloyd's List]] reported that severe corrosion had been discovered just weeks before the incident. However, no immediate remedial action had been taken.

*The [[w:Aloha_Airlines-vlucht_243|Aloha]] incident: 
On 28 April 1988, the Aloha Boeing 737 aircraft serving the flight suffered extensive damage after an explosive decompression in flight, but was able to land safely at Kahului Airport on Maui. One hostess was the sole fatality as she was blown out of the airplane, while another 65 passengers and crew were injured. In the  aircraft, evidence was found of multiple site [[w:Fatigue_(material)|fatigue]] damage leading to structural failure. The [[w:National_Transportation_Safety_Board|National Transportation Safety Board investigation]] report issued in 1989 attributed the incident to the failure of the operators maintenance program to detect corrosion damage. Because older airplanes are commonly not destroyed and will probably end up in service with another operator, safety issues regarding aging aircraft need to be well understood by the engineer and safety programs need to be applied on a consistent basis.

====Lesson====

Aging effects and corrosion of materials are not visible while the product is in test phase but have to be considered unavoidably! While designing large embedded control systems, engineers should have a long term vision and therefore look at the different Points Of View in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process the design process] of the company. Services, maintenance and testing after sale can be solutions for large embedded systems and can prevent the company from a bad name at long term.

=== &lt;u&gt;Case Study: The Therac-25&lt;/u&gt; ===

The [[w:Therac-25|Therac-25]] was a computer-controlled [[w:Radiation_therapy|radiation therapy]] machine, which severely overdosed six people between 1985 and 1987. Three of them died.
A case study of the Therac-25 will reveal following design difficulties:
* Software can fail
* Testing can be difficult, but is indispensable
* Reuse of software can be dangerous 
* Safety and usability are conflicting design criteria
In this case the mistake was made of reusing and trusting old software. This is typically a mistake made in [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#High-level_design|high-level design]].

This text will first discuss the background of the machine. In a following section some relevant accidents are described. Next, the text will focus on some software issues related to the accidents. In a final section some engineering lessons that can be learned from the accidents will be discussed. 

==== Background ====

The Therac-25, produced by [[w:Atomic_Energy_of_Canada_Limited|Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) and CGR, was a medical linear accelerator. Such accelerators produce high-energy beams in order to destroy tumors with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissue. The Therac-6, capable of producing [[w:X-ray|X-rays]] only, and the Therac-20, a dual-mode (X-rays or [[w:Electron_beam|electron beams]]) accelerator, were predecessors to the Therac-25. Both machines were versions of older CGR machines, which already had a history of clinical use, augmented with a minicomputer. They both had limited software functionality: the computer merely added convenience to the existing hardware. Hardware safety features from older machines were retained.

A few years later, AECL developed a new acceleration concept (“double pass”) which required less space, was easier to use and more economical to produce. This concept was used in the Therac-25 dual-mode linear accelerator.

In each mode (electron or X-ray), the necessary tools to create the proper beam were attached to the turntable, which rotated the equipment into the beam. Correct operation of the Therac-25 thus was dependent on the position of the turntable.
In the case of the X-ray mode, a beam flattener, mounted to the turntable, was used to create a uniform treatment field. In order to produce an output comparable with the electron mode output, this required a high input dose rate. A wrong position of the turntable lead to the wrong position of the flattener and resulted in a high output dose. Obviously, this is a grave hazard when using dual-mode machines.

Although the Therac-25 was controlled by the same computer as the Therac-6 and Therac-20, there were some differences. The hardware of the Therac-6 and Therac-20 was capable of standing alone (for instance, mechanical interlocks which ensured safe operation). However, the software of the Therac-25 had more responsibility for maintaining safety: the machine relied much more on the software instead of hardware safety mechanisms. For the software design of the Therac-25, design features and modules of the Therac-6 were reused. The software also contained some Therac-20 routines.

In the Therac-25, it was the software’s task to control and check the turntable’s position. The software was not flawless though as six people received a massive overdose. This is explained more in the section [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Learning from failure#Accidents|Accidents]].

When the software detected an error the machine could shut down in two ways:

* ''Treatment suspend: ''which required a machine reset to restart
* ''Treatment pause:'' which required a single key command to restart the machine.
When a 'treatment pause' occurred, the operator merely had to push the P-button to &quot;proceed&quot; and resume treatment without having to reenter treatment data. When this feature was called five times the machine would automatically suspend treatment.

==== Accidents ====

&lt;u&gt;July 1985, Ontario (Canada)&lt;/u&gt;

About five seconds after activation of the Therac-25, the machine shut down. It indicated a 'treatment pause' and that no dose was given. The operator tried a second attempt at treatment by pushing the &quot;P-button&quot;, but the machine kept shutting down four more times until it went into 'treatment suspend'. After the treatment, the patient complained of a burning sensation to the treatment area. In reality the patient was given a large overdose, approximately 100 times the intended dose.
Normal single therapeutic doses are about 200 rads. Doses of 1000 rads can even be fatal, if delivered to the whole body.

After investigation of this accident AECL found some weaknesses and mechanical problems, but could not reproduce the malfunction that occurred. AECL then redesigned some mechanisms and altered the software to tackle these problem. After these improvements AECL claimed that &quot;analysis of the hazard rate of the new solution indicates an improvement over the old system by at least five orders of magnitude&quot;. The hazard analysis, however, did not seem to include computer failure. Thus, more accidents occurred.


&lt;u&gt;March 1986, East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC)&lt;/u&gt;

The operator had lots of experience with the machine and could quickly enter prescription data. She wanted to type &quot;e&quot; (for electron mode), but she had pressed the &quot;x&quot;-button (for X-ray) by mistake. To correct this, she used the &quot;up-key&quot; and quickly changed the mode entry. The other treatment parameters remained. To start treatment she hit the &quot;B-key&quot; (beam on). After a moment the machine shut down and showed the error message: &quot;MALFUNCTION 54&quot;, which was not explained nor mentioned in the machine's manual. The machine went into ‘treatment pause’ which indicated a problem of low priority. The machine showed an underdose, so the operator hit the &quot;P-button&quot; to proceed treatment. Again the machine shut down with a MALFUNCTION 54 error.
The patient complained he had felt something like an electric shock and was immediately examined. The physician however suspected nothing serious. In reality the patient received an immense overdose. Real doses of 16500 to 25000 rads were estimated after the facts. Five months later, the patient died from complications of the overdose.


&lt;u&gt;April 1986, East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC)&lt;/u&gt;

Three weeks after the first accident at ETCC, a similar one occurred. The same operator noticed an error in the mode and used the &quot;up-key&quot; to correct it. Again the machine showed a MALFUNCTION 54 error. This patient died from overdose three weeks after the accident.
The ETTC physicist immediately took the machine out of service after this second accident and investigated the error on his own. The operator who remembered what she had done, worked with him. With much effort they were able to reproduce the MALFUNCTION 54 error. The key factor in reproducing this error was the speed of entering data: if the data were entered quickly the error occurred.

The same computer bug was present in the Therac-20. But because the Therac-20 had independent hardware protective circuits, this problem was just a nuisance.

==== Problem ====

Just a small part of the software will be studied, yet this can demonstrate the overall design flaws.

The two basic mistakes involved in the accidents are:
* poor software engineering practices
* building a machine that relies on software for safe operation


[[w:Race_Condition|Race conditions]] as a result of the implementation of multitasking are possible. Following reasons state why:
* Concurrent access to shared memory is allowed
* Aside from data stored in shared variables, there is no real synchronization
* The &quot;test&quot; and &quot;set&quot; for shared variables can’t be divided into two single operations.
These race conditions played an important role in the accidents.

[[Image:Treat_Therac_25.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 1: Tasks and subroutines responsible for the ETCC accidents (inspired by Nancy Leveson)]]


&lt;u&gt;Software bugs for ETCC accidents&lt;/u&gt;

Figure 1 illustrates the treatment process. The treatment monitor (Treat) controls the eight treatment operation phases or subroutines according to the value of the Tphase variable. The subroutine Datent (data entry) and the Keyboard Handler task use a shared variable (data entry complete flag) to communicate with each other. Once the data entry is complete, the Keyboard Handler task changes the value of this shared variable, which denotes Datent to change the value of Tphase. The Datent subroutine exits back to Treat, which will reschedule itself in order to start the following subroutine.

Another shared variable, MEOS, contains the mode and energy level specified by the operator. MEOS exists of 2 bytes: a low-order byte to set the turntable and a high-order byte, used by Datent, to set several operating parameters.

The operator is forced to enter mode and energy level by the data entry process but he can edit the data later. A problem can occur when the operator changes the data in MEOS after the ‘data entry complete’ flag has been set by the Keyboard Handler task. Datent is then already exited and thus won’t detect the changes. However, the turntable is set in accordance to the low-order byte of MEOS and can therefore be inconsistent with the information in the high-order byte. This inconsistency apparently can’t be detected by the software.

After Datent finished setting the operational parameters, via the high-order byte information, it calls the subroutine Magnet, which sets the bending magnets of the turntable.
Following pseudocode shows relevant parts of the software (taken from the paper of Nancy Leveson, p. 27):

'''Datent'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy specified &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;begin&lt;/b&gt; calculate table index
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/b&gt;
       fetch parameter
       output parameter
       point to next parameter
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;until&lt;/b&gt; all parameters set
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;call&lt;/b&gt; Magnet
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy changed &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then return&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;end&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; data entry is complete &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; set Tphase to 3
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; data is not complete &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; reset commando entered &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; set Tphase to 0
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;
'''Magnet'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 Set bending magnet flag
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/b&gt;
   Set next magnet
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;call&lt;/b&gt; Ptime
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy has changed &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; exit
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;until&lt;/b&gt; hysteresis delay has expired
 Clear bending magnet flag
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;
'''Ptime'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; bending magnet flag is set &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; editing taking place &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
       &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy has changed &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; exit
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;until&lt;/b&gt; hysteresis delay has expired
 Clear bending magnet flag
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;

It takes about 8 seconds to set the magnets. The subroutine Ptime is used to introduce this delay. Ptime is entered several times, because several magnets have to be set. To indicate the bending magnets are being set, a flag is initialized when Magnet is entered. This flag is cleared at the end of Ptime. When an editing request is submitted, the keyboard handler sets a shared variable which is checked by Ptime. If edits are present, Ptime will exit to Magnet, which then exits to Datent. However, this shared variable is only checked when the bending magnet flag is set. But this flag is cleared after the first execution of Ptime. So any edits performed after the first pass through Ptime will not be noticed! In the ETTC accidents the error occurred, since the edits were made within 8 seconds. Hence Datent never detected the changes. This problem was partially solved by clearing the bending magnet flag when all magnets are set (at the end of Magnet).
==== Lesson ====

Some lessons can be learned from these accidents.

*'''Do not ignore or overrely on software'''&lt;br&gt;Engineers may not assume a problem is caused by hardware. Extensive testing and safety analyses at software level is necessary, not on system level alone. Every safety-critical system should have incident analysis procedures that are applied whenever a problem is about to occur that might lead to an accident.


*'''Be careful reusing software'''&lt;br&gt;The reuse of software does not imply safety because it already has been exercised extensively. Revising and even rewriting the entire software may be safer in many cases, because every new development will introduce its own (new) errors.


*'''Design for the worst case'''&lt;br&gt;It is crucial that an error is detected and indicated properly (towards the operator) in order to take the right steps. A way to obtain correct information about the errors is by designing error detecting code into the software from the beginning. Self-checks, error-detection and error-handling features must be given high priority in making tradeoff decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Personal Development: Classroom Community and Character Development - The Tribes Program'''&lt;/big&gt; - (Kate R, Ayanda, Jeff M, Natalie, Laura B, Jamie T)

===Thesis===

	The education system today is evolving beyond traditional teaching methods.  Presently, educators are becoming more aware of the significant role that schooling plays in the personal and social development of students.  The atmosphere of a classroom has the ability to contribute to or detract from a student’s development and opportunity to learn.  Successful students will emerge from positive learning environments that promote community development, cooperative learning, and character education.  The Tribes program focuses on implementing these characteristics into every school in order to ensure that all students succeed.   
	
The Tribes program is a process of establishing a positive culture of learning and human development throughout an entire school community.  Tribes began in the early nineteen seventies in response to the concern that educators and parents were having over low test scores and a rise of school behavioural problems.  Jeanne Gibbs, the former Executive Director of the Centre for Human Development and co-creator of the Tribes process, piloted a group development process that would fundamentally change the atmosphere of schools.  Gibbs believed in the good of all students and argued that it was the systems that surrounded the students that impacted their lives and needed to be the focus of change (Gibbs, 1995, p.399).  The pilot program was a success and led to the creation of Tribes.  The overall goal of Tribes is, “to engage all teachers, administrators, students, and families in working together as a learning community that is dedicated to caring and support, active participation and positive expectations for all students (Gibbs, 1995, p.22).” Tribes is an effective and practical program that all teachers have the ability to implement in their classrooms.  The program is appropriate for all levels of the school system and can be successfully implemented in the music, drama, and arts classroom.  Tribes ensures that all student receive a complete personal and social education.  

===Community Development===

	The Tribes program involves the creation of long-term learning groups in the classroom.  However, before the class is ready to build their tribes, it is important that the whole class is an inclusive environment.  The first several weeks of a school term should be used to build community in the classroom and to establish a positive social climate.  Students should engage in activities where they are able to get to know each other, learn the important norms in the classroom, and become comfortable in the environment.  The teacher should encourage participation and help students become comfortable with group sharing.  The teacher must also demonstrate what their role is in the classroom.  In the Tribes model the teacher is there to guide the students in their learning process.  The role of the teacher is to present the subject to students, challenge them to work cooperatively through the information, and be there to give support and answer questions (Gibbs, 1987, p.36).  The teacher must therefore establish effective communication with the students.  This is a necessary component to the development of a positive teacher student relationship (Woolfolk, p.427).  This period of community building is essential to the success of the Tribes model.

	Throughout the community building period it is important to develop guidelines for what students need to do in order to feel they are in a trusting group.  The Tribes program has created four basic tribal norms for all classrooms to abide by.  The first norm is Attentive Listening.  Students should learn how to pay close attention to the words and feelings of their classmates.  Respect and care should always be a part of attentive listening.  The second norm is No Put-Downs/Appreciation (Gibbs, 1987, p.21).  The Tribes program believes in the importance of nurturing students’ self-esteem, and the discouragement of negative remarks is a key component to the increase of self-esteem (Woolfolk, p.71).  Encouraging students to value each other and state the appreciation of other’s unique qualities is another important part of helping students to feel self-confident.  The Right to Pass is the third tribal norm.  This norm means that students have the right to determine to what extent they will participate in group activities.  This norm helps to develop a safe space in the classroom because students are aware that they have a right to privacy.  Students also see that they are able to take responsibility over their own well-being and through this process students will develop the courage to become more open with their peers.  The last tribal norm is Confidentiality.  Students are assured that all sharing that is done within the classroom is honoured and will not be revealed.  It does not mean that students cannot share what they did in class, but rather that gossiping is forbidden (Gibbs, 1987, p.40-41).  Each of these tribal norms has equal value in the classroom and should be observed at all times.  Teachers should encourage the class to help each other stay true to the norms so that the students are also responsible for the creation of a whole class community.  

===Cooperative Learning===

Once the teacher feels that the class has created a positive and inclusive environment the students are ready to create their long-term learning groups.  In order for the groups to be successful the teacher must balance the members sociometrically.  The teacher must assign an age appropriate number to each tribe.  For elementary and middle school students there should be groups of four and five.  For high school and adult classes groups of five and six are appropriate.  The number of male and female students in each learning group should also be balanced.  Leaders in the class should be distributed among all the tribes.  Students who are of high and low peer acceptance should also be distributed evenly among the tribes.  Once the composition of the tribes has been determined the teacher should create an exciting activity for students to find their tribe (Gibbs, 1987, p.51).  The process of building tribal cohesion should then begin.  Each group should go through the process of inclusion, influence, and affection.  These stages involve the students building trust within the group, creating an atmosphere of support and care, and discovering their value within the group.  This process ensures that groups become unified and will be able to act as a true cooperative learning group (Gibbs, 1987, p.24).  
	
The purpose of the tribes is to not only create social connections among students, but to allow students to engage in cooperative learning.  Cooperative learning allows students to work together to maximize each other’s learning.  In a tribe, students share personal concerns and feelings with each other, as well as plan, problem-solve, discuss, and complete work from the curriculum.  Cooperative learning is beneficial for students because it has positive effects on their personal and social development, as well as their learning process.  For example, studies have found that cooperative groups can help increase students’ empathy, tolerance, and friendships (Solomon et all., Woolfolk, p.333)  In addition, it has been discovered that cooperative work can help students with their information processing.  Through discussions students are better able to organize and expand their knowledge, make connections and review material.  Cooperative work also encourages students to think critically and problem-solve in a group situation (Woolfolk, p.333).  In order for cooperative learning to be successful the groups need to maintain an atmosphere of positive support for all members.  Groups must also assume responsibility for themselves and their achievement of goals.  The teacher should never participate directly in the group, but should always maintain control and intervene if the social cohesion of a group breaks down.  The Tribes program is an effective way to create an environment for successful cooperative learning.  The tribes become support systems for the students and create a positive space for learning (Gibbs, 1995, 49).

===Character Development===

	The overall mission for Tribes is, “to assure the healthy and whole development of every child so that each has the knowledge, skills, and resiliency to be successful in a rapidly changing world (Gibbs, 1995, p.22).”  Essentially, the mission of tribes is to help students with their character development so that they can make a positive influence in society.  Throughout the entire process of tribes character development is a main component.  Character education is embedded in the Tribes program without it being lessons based on specific values.  The process of working in groups, for example, encourages helpful behaviour in students, it promotes inclusion and the celebration of diversity.  Students are encouraged to express their views as well as respect different points of view.  In groups, students also learn to establish trust among members, and through group work they become kind and caring individuals.  In addition to social values students also develop their self-actualization.  Students are encouraged to build their personal identification, and their skills, talents, and gifts are identified and valued by the whole class.  Students are also encouraged to develop self-respect and resiliency so that they can be socially responsible both in the classroom and in society (Gibbs, 1987, p.69-70).  Overall, the Tribes program is a beneficial process for students to participate in because it helps students to better develop their whole selves.



===From Theory to Practice===


The Tribes program has numerous connections to a number of the concepts outlined and discussed in the textbook.


&lt;u&gt;Motivation&lt;/u&gt;

The Tribes program fosters both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in several ways.  Tribes places emphasis on the acquisition of knowledge and skills that will serve students throughout their lives.  For this reason, the Tribes program is applicable and valuable to students – in and out of school – and many may be intrinsically motivated to participate and develop as individuals.  
The group dynamic around which Tribes is centered also contributes to students’ extrinsic motivation in a number of capacities.  For one thing, students’ may experience an increased desire to participate in activities that are community, or group, based.  Students often appreciate the opportunity for increased interaction and collaboration among peers. Tribes requires participants to provide each other with positive feedback and reinforcing statements of support which can be a powerful motivating factor.  Additionally, students may mimic the positive behaviour of others in their Tribes group(s).  
Tribes has the potential to help students develop as more self-regulating and responsible individuals.  Because students are extremely involved in the learning process, they have great control over their own learning and actions in general.  


&lt;u&gt;Self Concept&lt;/u&gt;

	Tribes can have a powerful impact on students’ positive perception of themselves.  The appreciation statements students are required to make about one another may help individuals to recognize their particular strengths and talents.  Tribes also offers students the opportunity to work in groups and be independent with regard to their own learning and behaviour, all of which may lead to increased self confidence in their abilities, as well as increased self-worth.
The four sources of self-efficacy (listed below) outlined in the textbook relate closely to this aspect of student development.
1.	Mastery experiences
2.	Level of arousal
3.	Vicarious experiences
4.	Social persuasion
When a student’s self-efficacy is healthy and well developed, he/she will put forward greater effort.  Additionally, increased self-efficacy also effects the student’s ability to set goals for him/herself and directly connects to his/her motivation with regard to a particular task or tasks.  This co-operative goal structure can support and enhance students’ motivation within a community-based setting.

''Potential problem'': While the group dynamic supports both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, it may also affect some students in a negative way.  Students may feel increased pressure or anxiety to contribute to the group, while others may refrain from participating at all for fear of humiliation. 


&lt;u&gt;Behavioural Views of Learning&lt;/u&gt;

The positive/affirming statements involved in the Tribes program act as reinforcers –  they strengthen or maintain the students’ positive behaviour and/or response(s).  One of the great things about Tribes is that is does not involve or condone punishers/punishment.  In fact, the program goes out of its way to ensure that this negative reinforcement does not take place – for example, all participants are enabled with the ‘right to pass’ on any given activity, without negative consequences or repercussions of any kind.

''Potential problem'':  One of the possible problems with the group/community approach is that, while all opinions are respected and all participants are expected to be positive and contributing group members, there may be individuals who are not satisfied with a particular group decision.


&lt;u&gt;Classroom Management: Establishing goals&lt;/u&gt;

	One of the ways in which Tribes positively impacts the positive environment is through increased student engagement. For reasons previously outlined, the Tribes program supports both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for students.  Increased motivation will lead to increased engagement in the classroom activities and environment and thus students will have the opportunity to participate in and produce quality, meaningful experiences.  Additionally, as mentioned above, Tribes helps students developed greater self-management, self-control and responsibility, all of which are extremely valuable with regard to ease of classroom management.
	
The 4 Agreements of Tribes communities:
1.	Attentive listening
2.	Appreciation/no put downs
3.	Right to participate/pass
4.	Mutual respect
The clearly established rules and procedures of Tribes also help to establish a positive classroom environment and decrease issues related to classroom management.  These four agreements, in particular, are designed to foster cooperation among students as well as self-acceptance.


&lt;u&gt;Classroom Management: Prevention&lt;/u&gt;

Kounin identifies a number of factors that help to prevent classroom management problems:
1.	Teachers must take student differences into account
2.	Teachers must maintain student motivation
3.	Teachers must reinforce positive behaviour.
Kounin goes on to state that individuals who are skilled at preventing classroom management issues all have four areas of skill:
1.	“Withitness”
2.	Overlapping
3.	Group focussing
4.	Movement management

The connection between Kounin’s ideas and the Tribes program are highly evident and, additionally, Tribes builds on these concepts by expanding the ‘preventer’ to include students as well as teachers. Because Tribes places great importance on student-directed learning, activities and environment, the students are all actively involved in contributing to the atmosphere of the classroom and directly connected to the classroom management problems (or lack thereof).


&lt;u&gt;Learning Environment: Establishing Community&lt;/u&gt;

Johnson and Johnson outline ‘three Cs’ of establishing a positive classroom community:
1.	Cooperative community
2.	Constructive conflict resolution
3.	Civic values

These principles are essentially the basis for the Tribes program. Johnson and Johnson identify ‘positive independence’ as individuals working together to achieve mutual goals.  This concept is a crucial part of Tribes – connecting to student self-direction, motivation as well as cooperation and affirmation.  Constructive conflict resolution is another important part of Tribes – seen in students’ right to pass as well as the ban on put-downs.  Additionally, Tribes supports the ‘I feel’ method of communication between students – particularly those in conflict with one another – and helps students to understand the emotion behind actions and behaviour, rather than allowing an aggressive action/behaviour to proceed with no understanding on the part of the aggressor or the recipient.  
Finally, because Tribes also aims to foster students’ character development, the idea of ‘civic values’ is also extremely applicable.  According to Kounin, students come to understand values through direct teaching, modelling, literature, group discussions and the sharing of concerns.  Again, Tribes takes this a step further by assigning these duties to, in addition to the teacher, the students themselves.

===Structuring a Tribes Lesson Plan===

Tribes lesson plans are generally structured to include 5 distinct steps:

1.	Energizer

2.	Circle Talk

3.	Learning Activity

4.	Reflection

5.	Appreciation


Each step addresses at least one of the  “Five E’s”: 

1. Engage

2. Explore

3. Explain 

4. Elaborate

5. Evaluate


'''&lt;u&gt;'''Step One: Energizer (Engage)'''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The purpose of the energizer is to serve as a warm-up and transition.  The energizer should prepare students physically and mentally for the upcoming learning experience in a fun and engaging manner. 


'''&lt;u&gt;'''Step Two: Circle Talk (Engage, Explain, Explore)'''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The circle talk is a way for students to become more familiar with themselves – their strengths, abilities, gifts, etc. in relation to the upcoming learning experience.  It is important that during the circle talk all students adhere to the four “community agreements” of the Tribes program.  This includes listening attentively while others speak, showing respect for the feelings and ideas of others, avoiding put-downs and showing appreciation, and honouring each others’ right to pass.  


It is up to the individual teacher to ensure that the circle talk is effective.  Some suggestions include:


- Remember that this is a time for everyone to speak – not just the teacher

- Allow at least 3 second of thinking time after asking a question

- Consider your students and decide what method of taking turns will work best.  Can the group handle speaking out randomly whenever they have something to contribute, or do they need more structure, such as using a ‘talking stone’?


&lt;u&gt;Step Three: Learning Activity (Engage, Explain, Explore, Elaborate)&lt;/u&gt;

Learning activities should help students to connect the new information being presented to prior knowledge and experiences.  A good way to do this is by starting the activity with personal YOU questions.  Examples of YOU questions include:


- How do you feel about the subject?  

- What experience do you have with this subject?
 

When students are responding to these questions, it is best for them to be in groups of no more than four.  This allows every student a chance to speak, and is less intimidating than sharing personal thoughts and experiences with the entire class.

The learning activity should require cooperative interdependence from students, so that every student is an important and necessary part of the process.  A great way to ensure cooperative interdependence is by having each member of each group take on a specific role.  Examples of roles include:

-	Facilitator

-	Recorder

-	Encourager

-	Summarizer

-	Time Keeper

-	Materials Manager


NOTE: It is important that students do not take on the same role every time – all students must have practice fulfilling each role.


'''&lt;u&gt;'''Step Four: Reflection (Engage, Explain, Explore, Elaborate, Evaluate)'''&lt;/u&gt;'''

Reflection is an important step in any learning process.  Research has shown that reflection can significantly increase the amount of information and number of concepts students retain.  There are three types of reflection questions:


1.	Personal Learning Questions (about what the student has learned or felt)

2.	Social Questions (about the interactions between group members during the learning activities, and what collaborative skills were used)

3.	Thinking Questions (about the actual content of the lesson, and what skills were required to understand and work with the information and concepts)


NOTE: It is not necessary for students to always answer the reflection questions out loud.  Students should be allowed the option of simply thinking about their answer, or of writing it down.


&lt;u&gt;
Step Five: Appreciations (Engage, Explore, Evaluate)&lt;/u&gt; 

This step is a great way for students to develop a sense of community and trust with one another.  Students can express appreciation for the efforts and accomplishments of the other members of their group, and can point out each other’s strengths and skills.  This step is especially important for high school students, who greatly value the opinions of their peers.  High school students often find praise or acknowledgement from a peer to be more meaningful than praise or acknowledgment from a teacher.

===Sample Tribes Lesson Plan===


This is a sample of a lesson plan that could be used on one of the first few days of a semester to introduce the Tribes program and help students develop a trusting and collaborative atmosphere in the classroom.


&lt;u&gt;Energizer: Three Ball Pass (5 – 7 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


This game helps students learn and remember each other’s names.  It also requires them to work collaboratively as a team. 

Start with the students standing in a circle.  The leader will begin the game by calling out the name of a student and tossing the ball to him/her.  That student will then call out another student’s name and toss the ball to him/her.  This will continue until every student has been tossed the ball, with no repetitions.  

The students should then repeat the same pattern of tossing, trying to increase their speed.  Once they have accomplished this pattern once or twice, a second ball can be added.  The second ball should be tossed in the same pattern as the first.  Once a ball has reached the end of the pattern, it should start all over again, so that the two balls are constantly in motion.  A third ball should then be added.

To increase the challenge of the game, any of the following strategies can be used:

-	The second ball can be thrown in the reverse pattern of the first

-	Each ball can be given its own pattern

-	The group can time themselves and try to beat their own best speed


&lt;u&gt;Circle Talk: Elements of a Positive Classroom (10 – 15 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Discuss what elements help to create a positive classroom environment.  Students can suggest what they would like to see/feel in the class, and things they would like to avoid.  Students can share examples of situations and environments that have been positive and why, and ways they personally can contribute to a positive classroom.  


&lt;u&gt;Learning Activity: Brainstorming the 4 Agreements (15 – 20 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Split the class into 4 groups.  Each group will start at one of the four flip-charts that have been set up around the room.  Each flip chart will have one of the Tribes Agreements written at the top:

1.	Mutual Respect

2.	Attentive Listening

3.	Showing Appreciation/ No Put-downs

4.	The Right to Pass


Explain to students that this is a brainstorming activity, and that there are no right or wrong answers.  Explain that the idea is to write down or sketch thoughts, ideas, feelings or images that come to mind when they consider the words on the flip-chart.  Remind them that they should work quickly, without commenting or discussing.

Give the groups 3-4 minutes at the first flip-chart to record their immediate reactions.  Once the time is up, have them rotate around to the next flip-chart. Each group should spend 3-4 minutes at each flip-chart, rotating through until they have worked at all four stations. 


&lt;u&gt;Reflection: Reflecting on the 4 Agreements (5 – 10 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Post the charts up where everyone can see them, and have the students sit facing them.  Pose the following questions to students:


Personal Learning:

-	How do you feel about each of these agreements?

-	Which agreement do you personally think is most important and why?


Social Learning:

-	What would have happened differently during this activity if we had judged, commented or discussed the ideas instead of simply writing them down?

-	How much did you personally participate?


Cognitive Learning:

- Did you learn anything new about these concepts and their importance?
 

&lt;u&gt;
Appreciations: Appreciating the Members of Your Group (5 – 10 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Invite students to share statements of appreciation, or recognition for others in their group.  Because this is the first time the class has done this, you can suggest that they start their statements in any of the following ways:

-	I like it when …

-	Thanks (name) for …

-	I thought (name) did a really good job at …

===Tribes in Action: The Secondary Dramatic Arts Classroom===


After a basic introduction to the Tribes program it is clear that there are four agreements required to initiate the tribes program into a school or a classroom are attentive listening, appreciation/no put-downs, right top participate/pass and mutual respect.  It is also clear that there are three stages of group development, beginning with inclusion, building through influence and ultimately creating a community.  If Tribes is a medium through which a community can in fact be created, one must understand what a community in a drama classroom might look like.


&lt;u&gt;A Community in a High School Drama Classroom&lt;/u&gt;

It is especially important for students in a dramatic arts classroom to feel safe since many of the techniques and issues raised, as well as the collaborative nature of drama projects require students to stretch their comfort limits and take risks.  Building a community among the students is an essential part of a functional and productive drama classroom.   Since drama involves taking risks, it is appropriate to look at strategies of creating communities for high risk students.   In their case study, “Serving Rural Youth at Risk: A Portrait of Collaboration and Community,” Robert Rossi,  Pamela Vergun and Larry Weise describe eight commitments that students must share in a community:  a shared vision and shared values, a sense of purpose, an incorporation of diversity, open communication, active participation, caring and trust, teamwork, respect and recognition.* Although this case study is focused on serving rural youth at risk, all eight of the aforementioned commitments are also essential in a drama classroom.  Consider the production of a play;  a diverse group of students, with a diverse mix of skills and interests, share a vision of performance in which every person plays a respected and recognized role whether that be as an actor, technician, designer, musician or writer.  As the show approaches, everyone must trust the individuals of the group and actively work together. 


&lt;u&gt;Inclusion and Influence as Community Builders&lt;/u&gt;

Since community building is a necessity in the dramatic arts classroom and the Tribes program describes community as the product of inclusion and influence, then a dramatic arts teacher needs practical strategies to incorporate inclusion and influence in their classroom. The Tribes program breaks these strategies into four categories: active listening, expression of appreciation, reflecting upon experience and collaborative work.  Each of these categories involves an essential aspect of the dramatic art form and each can also be cultivated through a variety of exercises that can easily be incorporated into the dramatic arts classroom.  


''1)  Active Listening''

Drama inherently requires active listening for acting and improvisation.  An actor can not act in a scene without listening to their partner or improvise a scenario without listening to the offers on the table.   Try these games to train active listening skills:


  '''Blind Association Circle''' 
  With the entire group standing in a circle, establish a rhythm, by swinging a hand. Once a rhythm 
  is established, one player starts by tossing a word to their neighbour, who associates on the word 
  and tosses another word.  It is important to stay in the rhythm. Tell the players to just say 
  `banana` if they feel they cannot think of a word, as long as the rhythms does not get broken. 
  Once the association has been to each player, continue, repeating the same pattern.  As this is 
  going on, the teacher will tap all players, gently on the shoulder, at tree different times.  The
  first tap: players close their eyes but continue the free association, sticking to the rhythm.  
  The second tap: everyone starts walking around (carefully!), eyes still closed.  Players have to 
  recognize the voice of their ex-neighbour in the circle to know when it is their turn.  Third tap: 
  all players, still eyes closed, and still associating, try to reconstruct the circle.  Exercise is
  over when everyone is in a circle again. Trainer should keep an eye on players so they do not 
  walk into anything.
  

  '''The Paperclip Game''' 
  Have the players form a line across the back of the playing area.  One person steps forward and 
  says what object he/she is and what their function is, such as &quot;I'm a paperclip, and I hold loose 
  papers together.&quot; A second person steps up and says what object he/she is, and what their similar 
  function is, such as &quot;I am a rubber band and I hold loose pieces of mail together.&quot; At that point
  a pattern is established and one-by-one everyone steps forward to heighten the pattern: 
  •	I am twine and I hold loose recyclable newspapers together. 
  •	I am shackles and I hold loose chain gang prisoners together. 
  •	I am religion and I hold loose communities together. 
  Repeat until it is as heightened as it is going to get, then start over again with a new object 
  and function.  This game is great to encourage students to actively listen for patterns and 
  heighten what has already been established.

Active listening is also an important skill for audience members to learn and apply. Encourage students to employ proper audience etiquette through active listening.  Create checklists or questions for students to answer while viewing each other’s work.  
  
  '''Questions could include:'''  
  •	What particular gestures, lines, or moments stood out as creating a believable 
         character?
  •	How did the performers relate to one another and when was it clear that they were 
         listening and responding to each other?
  •	Did the pace or rhythm of the production seem smooth or did it drag?
  •	How was the meaning of the text communicated through words, actions, or symbols? 
  •	What were the major desires, goals, objectives, and motivations of the characters 
         and how did these help you understand the meaning of the text? 
  •	Were the characters realistic, symbolic, allegorical or totally divorced from reality? 


''2)  Expression of Appreciation''

Teachers can build in activities to help students express their appreciation for one another’s work after a specific exercise, at the end of each week or at the conclusion of a unit or production.

  '''End of an Exercise: Oscar Speech Journal'''
  Ask each student to write an “Oscar Speech” thanking those who made their success in this activity 
  possible today; who helped you and in what way? Remind students that they can also thank themselves. 

  '''End of the Week: Secret Admirers'''
  At the beginning of each week, give each student a small card with the name of another student in 
  the class written on it.  (Be sure to keep track of who has been given what names which will help 
  you minimize repeats and deal with any inappropriate notes.)  Over the course of the week everyone 
  has to watch for one great thing they noticed their person do in class and then record it on the 
  card.  On Friday collect the cards then hand everyone their secret admirer note.

  '''End of a Unit: High Fives''' 
  Give each student a piece paper and instruct them to trace their hand on it.  Then they must 
  creatively add their name to the hand.  Sitting in a circle, pass the hands around so everyone 
  can write a thank you, complimentary or congratulatory message on each persons hand: a high five. 



''3)  Reflecting upon Experience''

Here are a couple of ways to facilitate personal reflection within a group.  Either can be done after any significant shared experience such as a production, unit, trip, or exercise.

  '''Spider Webs'''
  Have the entire class sit in a circle and give one person a ball of yarn.  That person will reflect 
  upon the present experience: something that worked well, something they learned or really enjoyed, 
  something that was memorable, etc.  Once they have finished they will wrap the yarn around their 
  wrist a couple of times and then through it across the circle to another person.  That person will 
  do the same thing.  Once the yarn has been to everyone once or twice, a web will have been created 
  in the middle of the circle.  Open a discussion about the nature of a web and how that relates to 
  our shared experiences here in the drama room.


  '''The Good, The Great and The Goal Tableaux''' 
  Divide the class into groups of 3 or 4.  Each group will decide upon a good part and a great part
  of the present experience.  The group will also think about what their goal or goals might be in 
  relation to the present experience.  Once all three things have been clearly decided upon, the group 
  will create a tableau to illustrate each.  The groups will present all three and the class will 
  describe what they saw, opening a group discussion after each presentation.  


''4)  Collaborative Work''

The majority of all work in the dramatic arts classroom is collaborative.  The curriculum itself is working to build community through inclusion and influence, however, an easy way to introduce the idea of collaborative work is through cooperative games.  These types of activities are great for early in the semester and require students to work in order to solve a problem or succeed as a group. 

  '''Shrinking Island'''
  Divide the class into groups of 6-10 students and give each group a blanket.  Ask the students to 
  stand on their   blanket and then explain that this blanket is a shrinking island.  The students 
  must get off their island and make it shrink (fold it in half) now the students must al get back 
  on. Continue shrinking the islands to see which group can work together to stand for five seconds 
  on the smallest island.
 

  '''Magic Carpet'''
  Divide the class into groups of 6-10 students and give each group a blanket.  Ask the students 
  to stand on their blanket and then explain that this blanket is a magic carpet.  Describe flying 
  through the air and get them to act out their adventure.  Now the carpet loses control and is 
  about to crash.  The landing instructions are on the bottom of the carpet, so each group must 
  work together to flip the carpet, while it is in mid air, in order to see the instructions.  
  No one can fall off!

===&lt;u&gt;Elements of Tribes that Relate to Visual Arts&lt;/u&gt;===

There has been an educational movement where teachers and administrators alike where they have become very interested in a program named Tribes.  In this part of the paper, two concepts are going to be explained. For the first part the ideas and process of Tribes in relationship to Visual Arts will be explain.  Through this explanation, an evaluation and critical ideas are presented in order to figure out away in order to incorporate Tribes in a Visual Arts classroom in a high school setting. 
	

Tribes is a program which was first developed for elementary school but has recently been modified to be able to be incorporated into high schools.  It is a step-by-step program which is designed to achieve precise learning goals. In order to achieve these learning goals, there are four agreements which need to be introduced by the teachers and honoured by the students within the whole school. Tribes in Visual Arts, is a process of establishing a positive culture of learning and human development not just within individual classrooms but in an entire school based community.  For the program, Tribes wants to assure the healthy and whole development of every child so when they go out into the work force they are able to be knowledgeable, skillful, and determined to be successful.


There four agreements which can be easily incorporated into Visual Arts which are key to Tribes.  These four agreements are (1) attentive listening, (2) appreciation/no put downs, (3) mutual respect, and (4) the right to pass.  In order to achieve all these elements within the Tribes program students need to learn a variety of skill which will help them to be able to collaborate and work will in long-term groups.  These skills include: helping each other to achieve tasks together, set goals and solve problems, monitor and assess progress and celebrating achievements.
	

When introducing Tribes to your Visual Art classroom, there are a number of things the teacher needs to do in order to make the program successful.  The first thing the teacher needs to do is introduce Tribes and explain it to the students in student friendly language.  The second thing the teacher needs to do is divide the class into groups which are balanced in terms of student strengths verses student's weaknesses.  Thirdly, the teacher needs to establish tools and techniques to help build group inclusion within the individual groups and as a class as a whole.  Once the students are in their groups and they have ideas about inclusion the teacher now can start transferring their power over to the students. 


In order to implement Tribes into a Visual Art class there needs to be a structure established based off of three things.  The first thing is cooperative learning, the second being character education and last of all, community development. Students become members of long-term learning groups.  In terms of cooperative learning students would be divided into groups.  For junior grades the groups would consist of 4 to 5 members and in high school the groups would consist of 5 to 6 members. For character development students incorporate their values into the everyday life in the classroom and they also learn essential collaborative skills.  Last of all, for community development students need to feel like they are part of a caring and safe classroom environment.


As mentioned above, for Tribes to work to the fullest extent, it has to be implemented in all classrooms.  This part of the paper will examine one possible way in order to implement it into a visual art classroom through a mural project.


===&lt;u&gt;Visual Arts Mural Project and Tribes&lt;/u&gt;===


In visual arts students develop many skills which can be directly linked to the ideas of Tribes.  Visual arts, developed respect for other opinions and feelings without being judgmental, promote cooperative learning where students develop problem solving skills, create a caring and trustworthy environment where students feel they can express themselves freely and last of all, the appreciation of cultural values.  All these elements that are developed in a visual art classroom help students socially develop so they will be able to be active citizens within a community.  It also helps student to be able to cooperate and work well together in large group in order to successfully create a class mural.
	

When starting a class mural project in a visual art classroom, a community must be build just like in Tribes classroom community must be created.  When building a community, make sure students understand that the activity is a group activity and they will have to work with everybody in the class.  This might be a hard thing to do in a visual art classroom because for many visual art project students work alone reflecting and thinking about their art.  Many students might be reluctant to have to work and create art with their fellow classmates when they are generally used to working alone on their art.  Students need to understand that many project that artist work on in today's world are done collaboratively.  To prove this point you might want to show students examples of work done by a group of artist.  Overall, students need to understand that large scale murals are done by groups of people.  
	

Once the students understand that they will have to work in group to create the class mural, the teacher can start and activity where the class brainstorms possible ideas for the mural.  It is really important to be inclusive and make sure all the students understand that every body's ideas are important.  This concept in Tribes is also important.  One issue that might develop with the students is decided on one idea when you might have several.  One way to solve this issue is to create lists where students would vote of the ideas presented. 
	

Keeping with the ideas of Tribes students need to influence the look of the mural.  In order to do this the teacher can create design projects to give students the power to influence to look and ideas behind the mural.  What students can do is create their own drawings on how they wish the mural to look.  Once the drawings are finished, have all the drawings posted around the class and develop a classroom discussion on which images they want to use for the mural.  Remember when having such a discussion it is important that students are nice and not mean and degrading towards their classmate's image.  To avoid negativity you might want to create an answer sheet for the murals so when the student talks they are using their sheets as a reminder of what they want to say.  Once decided on the design of the mural divide the mural up so every student gets an equal amount of the mural to create as their own.  
	

There are many things that teachers need to keep in mind when creating Tribes in their classroom particularly in terms of a large scale mural project.  Teachers have to make sure their instructions are clear and that every student in their class understands them.  Secondly, in order to make the project run smoothly teachers need to create a time schedule and emphasise how important it is to following it. Overall, when creating such a large collaborative piece or any visual arts project it is really important for the teacher to keep the students engaged.  Also, when creating a mural or class project of this scale it’s a great opportunity for teachers to get the parents involved in a school art exhibition.

===&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;===



'''Preamble'''


One of the key tasks for teachers of all subjects is to be able to assess and evaluate student performance.  Various disciplines employ a range of assessment and evaluation techniques, which can be tailored to meet specific student needs and goals.  Although it can sometimes be a challenging task for all teachers, it is especially so within disciplines where subjective/qualitative assessment is required – the arts.


Assessment and evaluation are uniquely elusive when it comes to subjects like Visual Art, Music and Drama.  In addition to measuring knowledge and understanding, thinking, communication, application, effort and technical skill, teachers are given the difficult task of gauging a student’s creativity.


Creativity is understood to be a highly individualized quality – it can materialize in an infinite number of ways that rarely fit into a given set of criteria.  In fact, the premise of creativity rests on the synthesis of new and unconventional ideas.  Creativity is also something very personal – it often represents an emotional investment by the student and, therefore, requires sensitivity on the part of the teacher.  These challenges raise an important question: '''''how might teachers go about assessing and evaluating creativity in student work?'''''



'''What does it mean to be creative?'''


According to dictionary.com, the adjective ''creative'' is defined as ''having the power or ability to create''.  This definition appears to focus on someone’s ability to produce rather than the quality of the work produced.  This view of pluralism is sometimes criticized in artistic circles for perpetuating the trend to make things for the sake of making things.  An example might be an artist who produces vast volumes of work, but spends little time contemplating the significance of each piece.  This person is productive but is he or she creative?  Later in this book, we will be looking more closely at the role of self-reflection and self-assessment in creative processes.


'''''Creativity''' – the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.; originality, progressiveness, or imagination.'' (dictionary.com)


The initiative to transcend conventions and create meaningful new ideas engages the students’ higher order thinking skills that deal with Application and Synthesis as per Bloom’s Taxonomy.  This indicates that creativity operates at a fairly high level of cognition.  It also means that in order to function at that level, students must build upon the more fundamental cognitive skills such as Knowledge, Comprehension and, in turn, Analysis.


So, for example, a student of classical music will learn notation first (knowledge).  He or she will then gain an understanding of musical theory (comprehension).  Finally, the student will practice the ability to examine the qualities of existing pieces of music (analysis) before applying all of the above to compose an original piece (application and synthesis).


The way we assess or evaluate higher order thinking is important because there is a certain risk involved for students.  In synthesizing new ideas, students open themselves up to peer criticism and possible embarrassment.  For this reason alone, many learners choose to “play it safe” and conform to what the majority of their peers are producing.  Therefore, it is crucial to consider the effectiveness of the different methods of measuring creativity.



'''Assessment vs. Evaluation'''


For the sake of further discussion, it is important to distinguish between ''assessment'' and ''evaluation''.  While the two functions are commonly paired, they differ considerably in purpose and approach.


'''''Assessment''''' is generally understood to be formative.  In other words, assessment takes place while learning is happening.  It is an ongoing process that is intended to improve learning by allowing the teacher to respond to student needs as they become apparent.  This approach is associated with holistic/constructivist methodology because it provides a “safe to fail” environment that encourages self-expression and creative risk-taking.
 

'''''Evaluation''''' is summative – it is normally done ''after'' a unit of learning has been completed.  Evaluation focuses on the formal grading of student work and, therefore, it is numerical and final.  It is often associated with competition, performance and risk.  While grades can be a powerful extrinsic motivator, they do little to encourage students to try new things because students want to minimize the above risk.


Are both assessment and evaluation appropriate methods for gauging creativity?  Teachers, students and parents would agree that creativity should be rewarded.  While assessment tends to offer more flexibility in working with subjective qualities, evaluation appears more readily applicable to the appraisal of technical skill and effort levels.

===&lt;u&gt;Peer Assessment and Professional Arts Juries&lt;/u&gt;===



This report uses the &quot;Peer Assessment&quot; model as prescribed by professional arts funding agencies such as The Canada Council for the Arts, the Ontario Arts Council, and the Toronto Arts Council to address the issue of how creativity may be evaluated in a contemporary high-school arts classroom.  For the purpose of this address, my principal source is The Canada Council for the Arts. In brief, there are advantages and disadvantages to this model, however, its' effective use in the classroom makes specific demands on the evaluated which may, or may not, be compatible with the learning objectives of the teacher. 


The following discussion on Arts Juries is broken into four parts: 
:'''1) How They Work;''' 
:'''2) When They Work Well'''; 
:'''3) When They Don't Work'''; 
:'''4) Peer Assessment in the Classroom'''.


'''1) &lt;u&gt;How They Work&lt;u&gt;''' 

Juries are selected from creative practitioners within the discipline being judged,  (dance, theatre, music, visual art), and are—within each discipline—specific to certain job descriptions like, performer, writer, director, producer, administrator. Juries must also be balanced in terms of gender, cultural background, and political/religious/aesthetic affiliation. Most juries need four to six people. Canada Council (CC) Jurors are paid well relative to a freelancer’s wage.


Juries are selected by an executive board, who also produces the event: handling communications; travel and lodging for out of town jurors, delivery of all print materials (a substantial amount of paper is used), and catering.


The executive also administers the adjudication, handling applications, to printing, to overseeing the 2 to 3 day process by providing structure to the meetings, and accelerating the process of elimination, which is what the whole thing is about. The criterion of adjudication is determined by the jury, based on vague administrative guidelines. 


Essential parts of the application:
*a clear and justifiable mission statement
*an accessible track record: media documentation, press reviews, endorsements and testimonial
*an application is judged by comparing the proposition with the company’s mission statement and track record 



'''2) &lt;u&gt;When They Work Well&lt;u&gt;'''

In brief, when the process works well, you get the funding you asked for, then execute the responsibilities you’ve outlined in your grant application.  Although it is hard to guage what any one successful candidate may learn from the process, there are a number of qualities successful applicants seem to have in common. By looking at a few of these it is possible to infer a learning curve for the evaluated over time.


'''organizational:''' Good grant writing requires detailed record-keeping and the maintenance of healthy professional relationships. Because most grant applications require a press file—print reviews, features, interviews and transcripts from broadcast media—the artist has to have these at hand. Also, because most applications require a sponsor, or professional endorsement of some sort, successful artists must maintain relationships with respected, often senior, members of their artistic community. Having a friend is one thing. Having a friend who is a respected member of your artistic community who is willing to both, risk his or her artistic reputation before the CC, and, take the time necessary to review your application then write an endorsement which speaks to the details of your proposal, is quite another thing.  


'''metacognative:''' Successful, grant-getting, artists must be rigorously self-aware of not only their body of work, but also, of their creative process because, for most artists funded by the Canada Council (CC), their initial successful grant application is the first substantial step in the creation of a new work. Also, because most grants are awarded to fund a specific phase of artistic development in the creation of new work, the artist is required to be detailed in imagining their artistic process, securing the personnel and means of production, budgeting for expenses, and determining the length of time necessary to fulfill their artistic obligations for the money awarded.  The end result is that a successful artist knows who they are, what they have done, what they plan to do, how they work, how they have failed and succeeded in the past, exactly how they hope to achieve their next task, who they can call on for help, and how much time they will need to accomplish their proposed short-term goals.  


'''responsibility:''' Accountability is the key to successful grant-getting. Artists have to make good on their previously funded promises, and continue to develop according to their own often-stated prescriptions for success. 



'''3) &lt;u&gt;When They Don’t Work&lt;u&gt;'''

There are significant downsides to Peer Assessment as practiced by the CC. Here are a few.


'''emerging artists:''' Because so much of the grant application is dedicated to assessing an artists’ creative ‘track record’ it can be difficult for the new artist to state their future claim against their past record. This aspect of the process requires new artists to seek respected artistic mentors for ongoing support, and legitimate media outlets for recognition. 


'''results are final:''' Lessons for unlucky applicants can only be achieved accumulatively over several failed attempts, and a synthesis of imperfect feedback.  Usually a simple sentence of anything like criticism appears in the rejection letter. A follow up appeal might yield something along the lines of, “…the jury didn’t feel that the application was strong enough to justify a new direction in terms of your mandate.”


'''subjectivity:'''  All judgments in any creative process, no matter how well structured, are subjective and fallible. At the extreme end of this paradigm is something called ‘low-balling’ whereby one low score from any juror on any round of evaluation can sink a proposal. This tactic is often the preserve of the grudge-bearing juror who has failed to disclose their bias to the rest of the jury.  This is rare, although every unsuccessful candidate will undoubtedly claim to have ‘an enemy’ on the jury…and sometimes they are right. What works against the tendency toward spurious judgment is the peer process itself. The process is intense, and usually lasts two or three full days. Also, any one juror may well find his or herself in the company of four or five substantially qualified, and well-connected, artistic peers who are more than capable of arguing aesthetic principles, and justifying their choices in a thoroughly rational manner. There is nothing whimsical about this process. Those who treat their role as an adjudicator lightly (or strictly emotionally) will not be asked back, will embarrass themselves in front of influential members of their community, and, will jeopardize their standing with the country’s most powerful arts funding body.  



'''4) &lt;u&gt;Peer Assessment in the Classroom&lt;u&gt;'''

The virtues engendered by successful grant-getting artists are compatible with the goals of arts education to a limited extent, namely, the virtues of self-awareness, metacognition, demonstrable discipline in terms of process, organization, and accountability. In the classroom however, it is difficult to establish a deep sense of accountability because the goals for success in the classroom are not as well defined for the students as they are in the professional arts where all candidates strive for just one goal: to get the money. If all students were driven to achieve but one goal—good marks for instance—then it might be easier for the teacher to police against favouritism, and harsh judgments, but this is not the case. Many students are all too willing to risk getting a good mark for the sake of peer-pressure, status-achieving behaviour, or short-term popularity.  


The task then, for a teacher who wishes to implement this type of assessment structure, is to start early in the academic year, work closely with the jurors for the first few cycles, and then be willing to use the process as many times as is necessary for the students to see the repercussions of their actions as jurors and prospective candidates.  The learning curve really takes off once students can weigh the cost of a previous harsh judgment when it is their turn to be judged. 


If well-done, this type of assessment can foster academic skills for students in three significant areas: metacognative; critical/analytical; intra-personal accountability. It does need to be scaffolded though, and the likelihood of success is much greater with mature students in a studio/conservatory type of environment where students learn together in close-quarters over the course of more than one year.

===&lt;u&gt;Self-Assessment &amp; Evaluation&lt;/u&gt;===



'''Definition''': &quot;The evaluation or judgement of ‘the worth’ of one’s performance and the identification of one’s strength and weaknesses with a view to improving one’s learning outcomes” (Klenowski, quoted in Ross 2).


&lt;u&gt;Three Types of Self Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (Rose 4-6)

:1.  Co-created rubrics for assignments:  Students and teacher discuss and list what the evaluative criteria or goals of an assignment should be as well as defining the levels of success for those criteria.
:2.  Short answer questionnaire: Students are asked to respond to questions about their performance.  For example:
::- What was good about your performance today?  Name three things and explain why.
::- What needs improvement?  Give 3 ideas.
::- Explain some exercises that would help you make those improvements.
:3.  Students rate themselves in specific areas of their performance and conduct.  For example:
::- On scale of 1-5, rate yourself on the following criteria:
:::i.  I came to class having practiced all of my parts.  
:::ii. I  come to class on time and promptly assemble my instrument. 
:::iii.  I can hear when I am playing well.

				    
&lt;u&gt;Why Teacher’s Use Self-Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 2)

:1.  It gives students the opportunity to contribute to the criteria on which their work will be evaluated increases their engagement with the work.
:2.  It contributes to variety in assessment methods, which aids in maintaining student interest and attention.
:3.  It provides information that might otherwise not be as easily determined:
::- Students are given a forum to assess and comment on the degree of effort they put into an assignment.
::- Students often bring unthought-of criterion to attention that a teacher might have otherwise overlooked.
:4. Some argue that students learn more when they share the responsibility for assessment and that increased attention and engagement lead to increased learning.


&lt;u&gt;Is Self-Assessment Reliable?&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 3)

Research shows that self-assessment strategies have been largely consistent, especially with older students (i.e. Grades 7 and up) who might better understand the criteria and how to apply them.  Self Assessment strategies have been more effective with shorter assessment periods. Longer assessment periods would suggest larger assignments with a greater number of criterion that are harder for students to remember and regulate.


&lt;u&gt;Does Self-Assessment Provide Valid Evidence of Student Performance?&lt;/u&gt;(Ross 3)

There are some discrepancies in this area:
:1.  Student ratings are often higher than teacher ratings when the assessments contribute to a grade, as the temptation to inflate their own grades seems to skew student judgement. 
:2.  There tends to be more consistency in student ratings when students are informed that their ratings will be compared to the teacher’s (i.e. using the same rubric) and that they will have to explain any large discrepancies between their ratings and those of the teacher.
:3.  Students may confuse their ability to meet the criterion of an assignment with the effort that they put forth to meet that criterion.  In light of what students might regard as a great degree of effort that was put toward an assignment, they might be more inclined to inflate their ratings to reflect their efforts.  
::- As problematic as this might seem, it does give the teacher the opportunity to identify and act upon student difficulties that might otherwise go unidentified.


&lt;u&gt;Strengths of Self-Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 7)

:1.  Students have a better understanding of their goals through their active role in creating the dimensions of a rubric.  Thus, there is often a greater degree of success in attaining those goals. 
:2.  Students have commented that self-assessment was a fairer form of assessment because it allowed them to incorporate criterion that would not otherwise be included (such as student effort or extra-curricular time commitments).
:3.  Students can communicate information to the teacher (i.e. goals and rationale) that they would otherwise not be able to.
::- Self-assessment gives students information that they can use to improve their own performance on an assignment by encouraging students to focus on attaining specific criteria and tracking their own improvement in those areas.  


&lt;u&gt;Weaknesses of Self-Assesment&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 7-8)

:1.  There is a concern that students will lower academic standards by inflating their ratings on their assessment of their own work.
:2.  Some students might not want to participate in the process, feeling that it is not their responsibility to carry out what they regard as the “teacher’s” job.
:3.  Such an attitude might decrease student motivation and commitment to their work.  Nonetheless, this does not apply as much to uses of self-assessment in the formative assessment of student work that would be taking place throughout the progress of a curriculum unit.  In conjunction, self-assessment and teacher feedback can be powerful tools in helping students succeed with their work.
:4.  It takes a lot of class time construct rubrics with students.  It can often take up to three periods to work out the details of a student created rubric.  Revised drafts often need to be presented to and reworked with the class over the period of a few days.   


&lt;u&gt;Four-Stages Involved in Making Self-Assessment More Effective&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 8-9)

:1.  The teacher should not surrender control when creating rubrics.  The teacher should use the process as a means to develop students’ deeper understanding of expectations in a manner that will allow them to relate to those expectations in their own language.  
:2.  The teacher must explain how to apply the criteria of a rubric by providing exemplars as well as modelling the desired expectations for the class.
:3.  The teacher should promptly provide comments and feedback for a student’s self-assessment in an effort to clarify the expectations and criteria within a rubric.  Comparisons between a student’s self-assessment and the teacher’s (or a peer’s) assessment of the same work using the same criteria may be use to resolve discrepancies and discourage inflated ratings.
:4.  The teacher should assist their students in using self-assessment data/ratings in a manner that would improve their performance with future assignments.  Providing students with recording forms to track performance over time will help them establish links between their immediate goals and their long-term goals.

===&lt;u&gt;Case Study: A Model for Self-Assessment and Evaluation&lt;/u&gt;===

In music class, students are expected to improve their technique and sound when it comes to playing an instrument.  Many teachers still enforce the standard practice of a playing test, which is typically done in front of one’s peers on a specific day.  But how can you truly assess someone of his or her growth when performance anxiety may play a huge role in the end result?  Some teachers have found that this rigid process is very ineffective in terms of progress assessment; although it may only require one day to ‘get through everyone’, it often becomes an unfair judgment.


Technology today is far more innovative than when I was in high school, even though that was only five years ago.  The following process is one that I plan to implement into my music classroom, and although I cannot take credit for the idea, I hope that other music teachers, like me will put this strategy into effect.  


A student enters the classroom knowing that today is the day that he will be tested on his trumpet.  He is a grade nine student who has only just begun playing and instrument for the first time in September.  It is now late in October, and he has been practicing hard both at home and in the morning ensemble classes.  He is not scared, because he knows that there is no pre-judgment, as he has never been tested before.  Yesterday, the teacher assured the class that they would not have to play in front of one another, but rather only her, in one of the practice rooms as the rest of the class has the period to work in sectionals on the two pieces of repertoire that they have been learning.  She then explains that she will be recording each of their playing tests as a way of assessing their progress throughout the year.


The teacher begins the class by leading a warm up so that everyone is in top-notch form.  Students will then take turns taking their test in the practice room as per a sign up schedule that was posted in the class last week.  Once the student enters the practice room, he or she is allowed to set up the music stand in which ever way is most comfortable for them, along with deciding whether they want to sit or stand.  From there, the teacher records the playing test while making a few notes.  Once the student has finished, her or she has the option to record again.  This is important especially for the first test as many students suffer from performance anxiety.  


A few days later, when all the playing tests are done, the teacher has each student listen to their playing test, assess what they have just heard, and only then does she explains to them their rubric markings.  The teacher may need to play the playing test a second time in order to accurately explain her assessment, and this is a good idea as it allows the student to have both a visual and aural assessment.  The teacher highlights the appropriate sections of a rubric in one distinct colour, gives a photocopy to the student and stores the original in a specific file for each student.  When the next playing test comes around, the teacher will use this original rubric for each student, but will highlight the appropriate sections in a different colour.  This process will allow students to visually see their own progress as well as areas in which they can improve.


This is a very strong way of assessing creativity as it includes both teacher and self-assessment.  It also allows the students to build on their learning, and to see how far they have come since the beginning of the school year.  Teachers should allow the students to compare their progress by listening to past recordings throughout the year, as this is also a great tool for motivating students to learn.  It is especially important that students listen to their first playing test following the last test of the year.  What a great way for students to see the actual result with documented proof.

===&lt;u&gt;A Unit Based on 'Creativity'&lt;/u&gt;===

'''''From Personal Experience...'''''

During second practicum, I decided that I wanted to further explore various approaches to assessing creativity within the classroom setting after having done a lot of research and engaging in great conversations with my seminar group.  With permission from my associate, I designed a ‘Self-Reflection’ unit for the grade nine vocal music classes that allowed them to explore their creative side while learning basic skills on how to analyze music.  I tailored this unit towards the current interests of the grade nines as I used a variety of music samples from those artists who they listen to on a daily basis.  I used weekly listening quizzes as a diagnostic assessment for what the students needed specific lessons geared towards and I fabricated my lessons to fill in the gaps in their learning.  


The summative activity for this unit was the ‘Self-Reflection’ project (or presentation), for which I allowed the students the freedom to choose how they wanted to create the visual aspect, but at the same time, I guided them through the assignment with a clear outline of specific requirements that needed to be included in some manner.  The various dates for this project were clearly outlined on a calendar in the classroom, so that the students would always know what to expect during each class.  A total of one hour of class time was given for this project over a span of two weeks (excluding other accompanying activities), which allowed them to collaborate with one another in order to format their project.  During this time I divided my time equitably between the class in order to give guidance or support in any possible means that I could.  


Just as there always seems to be one student who has trouble staying on task, so was the case in both of the grade nine classes.  In order to ensure success from all the students, I had the students write a ‘progress report’, which was their opportunity to tell me, in writing, what they were creating for their project, what they had done thus far, and most importantly what supports I could give them (if needed).  This activity confirmed many of my initial observations, which highlighted that the vast majority of the students in both classes were making good progress; however a few students did not fit into this category and I quickly turned my attention towards them.  A couple of the students had been off ill and needed some assistance as to how they might get started so late in the game, whereas other students were fundamentally unsure of their project.  I addressed each matter individually and offered extra help before and after school, which was an offer that I had extended to all students.  I myself created my own project to share with the students, which further excited some, or gave direction to those in need as the students became more self-directed.  


The summative project was due the week following March Break as I did not want any of the students to feel pressure to do work over the break.  I was thrilled with the projects that came in as they were all very individual and contained a great deal of creativity and imagination.  I received projects ranging from abstract drawings to music videos, dance presentations to original piano compositions.  I evaluated each project based on four rubrics, (*) which included assessment strategies both formal and informal: 
	
*1) Theory   
*2) Communication (the project/presentation itself)
*3) Creation* (the process) 
*4) Thinking and Inquiry (written reflection)

Marking these projects was very difficult even after creating a rubric with the students however, I decided to mark based on the rubric for everyone first, and then assigned four separate grades based on the rubric and strands of assessment and then gave consistent equitable grades.  I put a lot of thought and consideration into these grades and provided each student with detailed comments regarding their areas of strengths and personal connections to their project.


'''''Reflection'''''

The response that I received from this unit was overwhelmingly positive and not only did I receive praise from my associate (as this unit “encouraged students to explore other avenues of art”), but I received a phone call from one of the grade nine parents who was very thankful for my “allowing [of her] daughter to explore such creativity and share her gifts (for the first time) with an audience (the class)”.  This particular student had written an original piano composition based on the song Winter by Tori Amos, and not only was it an outstanding piece, but she performed it with extreme grace, passion and confidence.  


My experience with this unit was very rewarding, full of many unforgettable moments that I will always treasure.  I believe that each person has a gift to share and this project allowed me to uncover many hidden talents within the various arts disciplines.  It is projects like these that students will never forget as you take them ‘outside the box’ from the traditional ways of thinking.  The students have learned a new appreciation for songs they relate to on a personal level and I learned the value of assessment and feedback as seeing the students read over my comments was a very rewarding experience.

== Magical Creatures ==

Forgive me for poking my nose in here, but I see that withinFocus hasn't answered your question yet, so I thought that as another relatively major contributor I should try to answer.

Features in a magical creature? Well, that's very much up to you. What normally I would suggest there would be either a quick description of the physical or magical characteristics of a creature, with emphasis on the specific characteristics that are involved in the story. For instance, the Murtlap, characteristics could mention basic shape (rat-like with sea-anemone-shaped growth) and definitely should mention story related features (tentacles have healing qualities). Creatures like the Ashwinder, of course, that have no real story role, should only get a physical description. We have to limit the amount of description, that box being meant for a quick once-over only.

Hope that helps. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:46, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

:It did help. Seeing as some creatures have quite a few features, I was wondering which go in that box. Thanks --Cysiro ([[User:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;]]) ([[User_talk:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 17:11, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

::Just have to pick the most important... important being what, if anything, plays a part in the story. In the case of Acromantulae, it's hard to tell... spiders, venom, large size, sentience, and ability to talk are all important.

== Info boxes at the top of the article ==

I note that in the info area for the spell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]], you have added a link back to Magic#Spells. Generally, we haven't been doing that; normally, we would just leave it as &quot;Spell (Charm)&quot;. While I understand the reasoning, there are about a hundred magical items that would have to be altered at this point if we were to make that consistent, and probably two hundred characters... and characters would be a real bugbear, as (for instance) Draco is in the Slytherin House group, in the Death Eaters group, in the Malfoy Family group, and in the Inquisitorial Squad (if we have as yet created a group for them), and which of those would you link back to? I suspect it's probably best to just allow backtracking by means of the &quot;breadcrumbs&quot;. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:20, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
:I did see your response here, and felt I couldn't add anything to it... why I said nothing.
:I'm still not convinced of the value in having a back link to the magic page, but I have no objection to it. It is slightly redundant because of the breadcrumbs (top left of page, any Magic page will have links to Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter &gt; Magic on it) but because it goes back to the section rather than just to the Magic page, it still has some small value. I won't quibble, and won't revert, if you want to put those in. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:16, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

== Clabbert ==

I'm away from my sources and can't check that at the moment, but that page is scheduled for a visit soon anyway. If you wish, you can move the page, which would correct the spelling; or I can do that later -- someone's going to have to revisit that page anyway.

By the way, signing your comments with four tildes &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; is always appreciated, as that way we know immediately who made the comment. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:05, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

:I moved the Clabert to Clabbert, and changed it on the Magic page. I'm not sure how to delete the old one. ~''Cysiro'' ([[User:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;]]) ([[User_talk:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 07:14, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

== One other thing... ==

So long as you are going through the various magical items, there is one other thing that you might look at. We changed the standard framework some time back, so as to allow some magic description before the spoiler, and that change has not yet replicated throughout the Magic area. If you could, it would be useful to make that change as you go by...

The old framework looked, in part, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

== Analysis ==

&lt;/pre&gt;

Updated, the same part looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;

== Overview ==

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

== Analysis ==

&lt;/pre&gt;

If you could, inserting that Extended Description, and perhaps breaking the text into what belongs before the spoiler warning, and what belongs after, would be extremely useful. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:39, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

== First sentences ==

I have no real issue with it either way... but it has been bold italic since I started working here a couple years back, so I have continued in the same vein. If there is guidance in a Wikibooks style guide, I would accept that over Wikipedia's style guide. 

One thing to be aware of: I suspect there are at least 300 pages that are done consistently in the bold italic style. It would be a tedious job to make the change to simple bold, and we stand a very good chance of losing consistency. I personally feel that there is no point in making a change that involved for purely cosmetic reasons. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:30, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

:Actually, the [[WB:MOS#Content layout|Wikibooks Manual of Style]] states: &quot;It is suggested that: ...the first use of the title words or words that are akin in sentiment to the title words are marked in '''bold'''... when a new term is introduced, the term is ''italicised''.&quot; I suppose that the idea of bold and italics was that this is not only the title, but the first use of the term. And of course, it is only suggested, which tends to lighten the weight of the recommendation.

:That said... I have no objection if you want to change the standard, but I don't see any significant difference in appearance, and don't think it's worth the effort of doing it manually. If I felt a need for it, I would talk to Whiteknight, and see if he could do it with a bot. If you do want to it manually, I would drop a note on Whiteknight's, mike.lifeguard's, AdRiley's, and withinfocus' Talk pages, so they don't revert you thinking you're vandalizing.

:And I will quietly point out that you were, at one point, going to go through the magic pages classifying spell types, and lost interest after doing 9 of the hundred or so. If you are going to change formatting like this, you really should plan to set aside enough time to do the whole project, rather than leaving us with two different standards. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:37, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

Yeah, I'm not really interested in that so please don't continue. We've been doing it this way since the book's inception and I don't really care what any style guides external to our book are saying (despite that they don't disagree with what we're doing anyway). We have our own procedure and two of us (me, the person who created the entire system in the first place, and Chazz who does almost all the editing nowadays) aren't that interested, so I'll say this is a no-go. Please revert what you've done or tell me what you've done and I will take care of it. I like that you want to do work here, but I don't feel this is a supported change and there is better work to be done elsewhere. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:36, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for changing it back. In the end I feel we could definitely use your talents on something else and don't think such a change is necessary. If you were to see our book in LaTeX or PDF format you would notice that it's more pleasing to the eye as well. I certainly don't want to scare you away from the Guide. Good luck with all the other tasks our book needs. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:12, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

== Magic item... ==

Hate to trouble you with this. I note that you made a change so that Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was a footnoted reference... but somehow, that also made all of the Unforgivable Curses become footnoted with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Did you want to straighten that out? Or should I? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:32, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

:A bit of a fight to find information on reference groups, but it is now dealt with. And it's not ideal, but it is, I think, the best we can do for now. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:09, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

== In re Rolanda Hooch ==

I am somewhat unsure of whether Rolanda is actually given as a name for Madam Hooch in the books or not. I seem to have a faint memory of McGonagall using the name in warning at some point, but I don't know exactly where and I can't put my finger on it now.

On the other hand: According to the FAQs on Rowling's site, there were in fact two sets of cards, the trading cards game and the Chocolate Frog cards. While Rowling has stated that she was the author of the descriptions on the cards, she didn't say which set, though of course it could be both. As such we could consider the cards canon as well, though we tend to deprecate them. The reason we don't have Quirrell's full name on the article title is that one set of cards gave his name as Quirinus, the other as Slatero, leaving us with no valid authority. Apparently, both sets of cards give Madam Hooch's first name as Rolanda.

On the gripping hand: I am currently working my way through the characters, trying to complete at least the &quot;role in the books&quot; sections. Several supporting characters appear many more times in the books than they do in the summaries: Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan being classic examples, along with Alicia Spinnet, Katie Bell, and Angelina Johnson. I'm keeping notes of these characters as I find them, and will do a full re-read of the series with them in mind once I've finished the easy ones. Madam Hooch is already listed among them; if it turns out that her first name is not given in the books on careful re-read, I will change the article name.

I would suggest that the person to ask there would be Withinfocus. I'm really more of a writer; he's more on the policy side. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:31, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

== Umm... a small suggestion? ==

Instead of going over and over and over stuff that is already present, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|one particular chapter of the Muggles' Guide]], perhaps I could suggest that there are still a lot of empty areas, notably in analysis both of the books and of the characters, that could use new content? I'm not saying that what we have is perfect, but I think that at the moment we are still far more in need of new stuff, rather than polishing what we already have. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:40, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
:Where else? Oh, there are so many... let me see. At this point, we have summaries for all of the chapters of the books, but the Analysis and Greater Picture sections on all of them are sorely lacking, except in a few places like PS1, which has, I think, rather been worked to death at this point. We're sort of breaking questions in the chapters into Review for the ones that are answered in the summary, and Further Study for those that aren't. In Characters, I'm dealing with the role in the books sections, but the Analysis still needs work in a lot of places. Many bits of Magic still need Analysis and Greater Picture. Many of the magical creatures mentioned in FBaWTFT need actual write-ups; they are just placeholders now, but as it was ChazzJr who wanted them in there, if he doesn't write them up I guess it will fall to me. Major Events are languishing, and we're likely to have missed several, particularly ones that occur in DH. I guess, pretty much across the board, we need work on analysis. If you don't feel that your strength lies in analysis, we still need Overview and General Description work done on a lot of items in Magic and Major Events.

Ke2 is considered to be a very dubious move. The problems with 2. Ke2? are that the King move prevents castling to protect the King, endangers the King, ignores development and the center, and blocks the Queen and Bishop, which are the two pieces that are free after 1. e4. All that being said, it can be used as a surprise to unseat Black, as many novices may be unable to cope with the unfamiliar board positions of the Boungcloud Attack. However, if it has been encountered before, it usually results in a defeat for White.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Creativity and Mindfulness'''&lt;/big&gt; – (James C, Lisa, Eli, Jonathan, Christopher)


'''Thesis'''

Creativity and mindfulness are two psychological elements highly conducive to effective learning.  By facilitating creative approaches to educational tasks, students are better able to actively participate in the learning process in a potentially open, engaging and stimulating manner.  A creative mindset forces a teacher to think outside the box, abandoning more traditional approaches to education such as lecturing, excessive overheads, learning strictly by rote, or a “chalk and talk” methodology.  Creative thought (or divergent thought) is defined as “a mental process involving the generation of new ideas or concepts, or new associations between existing ideas or concepts” (Wikipedia).  In context of education, creativity encourages an educator to attentively assess the various types of learners within the classroom, and to actively employ original and appropriate approaches to learning to reach all levels and skill sets.  Attention is one of the most powerful tools to be exploited by an educator in terms of student engagement.  The question is: how does a teacher achieve and sustain high levels of attention within the classroom?  We would argue that innovative and creative approaches to lesson plans and classroom instruction are one of the most effective means of achieving this state. Let us now explore some strategies involved in creating such approaches. 

As explored by Woodfolk et al., educators can implement a variety of creative teaching techniques in the classroom including: spontaneous and surprising physical action, the use of bright colour on the board and with notes, the use of scripted and spoken word with academic subjects, posing intriguing questions, variance in tasks and instruction, changing physical environment (lighting, décor), and variance in vocal tone and volume level during instruction.  In order to gain student’s attention, avoid flicking lights or clapping hands as in a traditional approach.  Instead, try to incorporate the sound of a bell, a wind chime, or even a Tibetan singing bowl (as recently done in a class workshop).  The intention is to emphasize “variety, curiosity, and surprise” (Woodfolk et al.) within students. 

'''Mindfulness'''

Mindfulness, practiced both by teachers and students alike, is yet another positive means of maintaining focus, building classroom community, and optimizing learning potential.  Mindfulness can be approached from two major aspects: cognitive, psychological mindfulness (general awareness and attention), or an Eastern, Buddhist approach to mindfulness including the practice of meditation, consciousness and the application of current moment perception (the power of the “Now”).  From the Western standpoint, mindfulness is defined as an active attentiveness to task and detail.  This is a quality that all educators and parents alike strive to nurture within a student in terms of their daily focus regarding academic tasks.  From the Eastern standpoint, mindfulness is defined as “a technique in which a person becomes intentionally aware of their thoughts and actions in the present moment, non-judgmentally” (Wikipedia).  It should be mentioned that mindfulness is a skill that needs to be both practiced and developed.  Ideally, an educator could provide a student with the tools to enhance this skill.  Further, in order to facilitate an environment conducive to mindfulness, considerations around disciplinary measures needs to be taken into account.  Educators need to move away from a dictatorship approach to discipline to create an open, safe space for students and teachers alike to explore “the self”.

Let us explore the benefits of mindfulness in an educational setting and some of the tools used for its development.  Meditation is among the strongest act of pursuing mindfulness and there are several forms to partake of including: breath, mantra, visualization, and contemplation.  The intention of meditation is not necessarily to achieve a mindset completely devoid of thought, but rather a state of acknowledging thought and allowing it to pass through the consciousness without preoccupation.  Several studies have been conducted to display how mindfulness and meditative practices actively reduce distraction and help to avoid stress.  This is of particular use in the classroom to assist students with focus, and coping skills around stressful situations such as testing and examinations. 

Current moment perception also assists a student with actively receiving a speaker by removing a preoccupation with either the past (regret) or the future (anticipation).  With this type of self-focused exploration, students and educators develop the ability to “show up” in the classroom and in their daily lives.  They are better able to engage in active listening, be analytical with subject matter, and integrate their learning into their life experience.  Other benefits include the development of openness, self-awareness and insight, enhanced speaking and listening skills, and a consciousness of the diversity around them.  From a place of self-understanding comes an ability to appreciate the richness of another individual’s life experience.

'''Contemplative Education'''

A specific philosophy of higher education that actively implements the above-explored techniques is known as Contemplative Education.  Founded in the United State in 1974 by educator and practitioner Chögyam Trungpa, this mindful practice was incorporated into the Liberal Arts studies at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.  Contemplative education “ infuses learning with the experience of awareness, insight and compassion for oneself and others through the practice of meditation and contemplative disciplines. It seeks to integrate the best of Eastern and Western educational traditions, helping students know themselves more deeply and engage constructively with others” (Wikipedia).  The act of learning is not solely a thinking mind activity, but rather an opportunity for a student to also examine their inner beings as a means of completely integrating what they have been taught.  The engagement in mindfulness awareness allows a student to reside in the present moment and to potentially deepen their academic study.  This philosophy was further applied to higher arts education with the Bachelor of fine Arts in Jazz and Contemplative Studies curriculum at The University of Michigan School of Music.  Within this program, meditation practice was combined with related studies in jazz and overall musical training.

“The value of contemplative education is measured in students’ ability to put their wisdom and insight into practice through creative, helpful and effective action” (Wikipedia).

'''An Exploration of Community'''

Creativity and mindfulness are elements actively supported in present-day communities including private, public and independent educational institutions throughout the globe.  We will further examine the application of these elements through community and educational philosophy models that demonstrate how creativity and mindfulness are actively nurtured, and positively implemented to produce abundant learning outcomes.  Such pedagogical models and communities include the One World Program at George Vanier Secondary here with the Toronto District School Board, an intimate spiritual university in New Brunswick called St. Stephen’s University, and the international Waldorf system.  With the exploration of these models and communities, we hope to abundantly express to our readers the importance of creativity and mindfulness in combination, and the potential abundant learning outcomes from their application within the classroom.  These models will be explored in terms of our text's theories, and used further to make recommendations to us - the new teachers entering the profession.  We will also be exploring and suggesting techniques to both promote and develop mindfulness more deeply.

'''Creativity'''

'''Introduction'''

What is creativity?  Is it something that can be learned in a classroom?  Certainly creativity means many things to many people and is often dependent on context for its definition.  The creative process involves many complex layers of cognition and though it is questionable whether or not we will ever fully comprehend all of the exact science behind creative thought, we can offer four characteristics often associated with creativity.  First, creativity always involves thinking or behaving imaginatively. Second, overall this imaginative activity is purposeful: that is, it is directed to achieving an objective. Third, these processes must generate something original. Fourth, the outcome must be of value in relation to the objective.

'''Theory'''

The definition of creativity is often assumed to imply a purely artistic setting, but is creativity not also a large component of science, mathematics, engineering, and business?  Without a quick definition for creativity that will suit all people at all times, we can examine some of the thought processes behind creative thought so that we might better understand how to foster creativity in our classrooms.  Leslie Owen Wilson, a professor of philosophy and education at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, highlights two types of thinking that are involved in creative thinking - ''convergence and divergence''.  

'''Divergent''' thinking is most usually associated with the ability to elaborate, to fluently think of varied and original ideas.  Brainstorming is one example of this type of thinking. 

'''Convergent''' thinking is defined as “the ability to use logical and evaluative thinking to critique and marrow ideas to ones best suited for given situations, or set criteria.”  This type of thinking is used to make well-formed decisions after consulting and evaluating an array of ideas and information (Wilson, 1997).  

The creative process involves a combination of these two types of thinking, forcing the practitioner to constantly transition from the scattering of ideas (brainstorming) to the refining of thoughts and concepts most applicable to the given situation (convergence).  This process can involve a lot of trial-and-error type of experimenting, but, as Wilson points out, the most successful “creative thinkers” are the those who were/are persistent with their efforts.  

Though the definitions for creativity may be infinite one thing that seems to be a consensus among cognitive theorists is that a “eureka!!” moment, or moment of creative inspiration cannot come of its own volition.  In order to achieve such a breakthrough, the practitioner must first have studied and attained a workable knowledge of requisite techniques and/or subject matter.  Without such knowledge, creative thought becomes aimless (devoid of  purpose) and lacks any concrete objective on which to substantiate value or relevance.

'''Application'''

At Georges Vanier secondary school in Toronto, Ontario there is a program called the One World Youth Arts Program (OWYAP).  This program is offered to students as part of the music curriculum and provides an open forum where students can share ideas and develop their creativity.  It is an open-enrollment program, meaning there are no prerequisite courses or formal music training required for admission.  Along with being a music course, the OWYAP offers students a chance to explore and embrace the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Through their music, students are encouraged to promote positivity, a strong spirit of community, and the idea that change starts from within. 

The delivery model for OWYAP is more that of an art or music recording studio than a traditional instrumental-music classroom.  Using Cubase software, students work individually at computer stations composing original scores, learning basic piano skills and elements of harmony.  They also have opportunity to collaborate with classmates on recording projects and/or live performances.  

The OWYAP stays true to our statements regarding creativity in that the more knowledge and ability students gain in terms of music theory, piano skills (the main interface with the Cubase software is a piano keyboard), and the recording equipment, the better able they will be to create coherent, imaginative and original compositions.  The core components of the OWYAP curriculum are student-derived, which allows the course to be tailored to individual wants and abilities.  This strong personal element provides students with the time and confidence to experiment with their work, allowing them to explore both ''divergent'' and ''convergent'' methodologies.  The main task for the instructor in such a setting is making sure the students stay on task, encouraging them to realize how their final product shows true value and connection to the original objective.  Having several chances to create original works throughout the semester allows students to see (hear) the improvement in their work and realize that knowledge is necessary for progress.      

Through promoting acquisition of a stronger skill set and knowledge base in a practical setting, as well as providing opportunity to immediately implement such newly acquired skills in a supportive environment, the OWYAP exemplifies an ideal classroom model for the development of creativity. 

'''A Challenge to all Classroom Instructors'''

The One World Youth Arts Project at Georges Vanier is a unique setting indeed and we can’t all be expected to provide such a highly individualized atmosphere for our students.  However, what we can do is try to realize specific elements within the OWYAP that promote creative thinking, supportive community and engaging curriculum, and work towards incorporating those elements into our own lessons.  The push towards standardization over the past century has become infectious even to our own personalities.  As classroom instructors we should not strive to get everyone on the same page, but challenge our students to find their own page, bringing original thoughts and personality into our classrooms.

'''The Role of Community'''

'''Introduction'''

While creativity has long been held as a formative aspect of any learning community, its converse is said to be just as true. The community in which an artist is raised and develops her craft has incredible significance in terms of her effectiveness and growth. Specifically, learning communities that value genuine relationships and caring are better facilitators of creativity. 

Another factor that is directly related to the quality of one’s learning community is one’s capacity for self contemplation, or mindfulness. Logically, communities that intentionally create space for mindfulness, or put another way (ironically), are mindful of its members’ mental wellbeing, tend to demonstrate a greater overall level of mental health and stability. Throughout this section, the validity of these claims will be demonstrated both theoretically and by referring to a specific example of such a community, currently functioning on our planet Earth.

'''Theory'''

In order to proceed, it is necessary to both identify what constitutes a genuine relationship, and define the term caring. Woolfolk et al. refer to an author named Nel Noddings, who for over ten years has written extensively on the value and importance of caring within educational systems. A core argument under-girding Noddings’ views, is that caring is an intrinsic necessity of human life - all people want and need to be cared for. She claims that it is a “longing for goodness that arises out of the experience or memory of being cared for…” (Flinders 2001, p. 211). An encounter with a student is definitive of caring when it exhibits the following characteristics: the ‘carer’ is reflectively oriented toward the ‘cared-for’ in a way that is receptively attentive, the carer demonstrates an active helpful interest that assumes action, and all of this is recognized by the ‘cared-for’ as an act of caring - that is, a measure of perception is required to authenticate the experience. Relationships between teachers and students that consistently involve this kind of caring might be called genuine relationships. 

Hence, having defined these terms, it is the learning communities that deliberately incorporate the primacy of genuine caring relationships into their vision that are the focus of this section. These structures tend to exclude those educators who are concerned solely with the financial aspects of their occupations to the exclusion of all else - those who are “putting in time” and do not care about their students.

Creativity can be described as the spontaneous human response that results from provoked emotional dispositions. While such response might occur in an atmosphere of oppression or constraint, it absolutely flourishes when expressed from within an atmosphere of security, affirmation, and constructive inquiry. Hence, schools that foster these characteristics are excellent facilitators of creativity. 

Finally, while there are many individuals who have undertaken self-contemplative tasks, the degree to which a community encourages such behaviour directly affects the success of it. While this might seem obvious, it is imperative to recognize the simple reality underlying this idea: in our day and age, if you don’t make time for it, it will not happen. Also, it is important to note that, while certainly having roots in Eastern mythical religions, self-contemplation is a mental health activity that transcends boundaries of all kinds, being found in all major religions and people-groups throughout the world. For that reason, it is completely viable as a solution for stress, and may be effectively used in some capacity within any educational institution to promote mental health and wellbeing.

'''St. Stephen’s University'''

One such institution (though be it post-secondary) is a small trans-denominational Christian liberal arts school in the tiny town of St. Stephen, New Brunswick. This school has begun to draw world-wide attention for its uplifting community dynamics, which among many other things, foster both creativity and self-contemplation. The school is situated on a hill near the St. Croix river - a scenic property that supports a number of individual rustic multipurpose buildings, all of which have both bedrooms and classrooms. From simple maintenance to cleaning, students living within these buildings are responsible for their cleanliness on a scheduled weekly basis. Excellent cooking is also done by the students, who eat in a large family-like room with lots of small tables to facilitate interpersonal relationships: professors and students alike eat together and informally discuss issues both academic and personal.

Mindfulness, or contemplative space more generally, is fostered in many ways at St. Stephen’s University. First, there are three weekly chapel meetings that happen after lunch, where various members of the community and student body are invited to share an inspirational message. Second, time for prayer is allocated before the beginning of any meal. Specifically, those who are waiting in line for food form a rough circle, join hands, and rather than only offering words of thanks for their food, pray for those in need in their community, or even pressing issues facing the world. Third, contemplative space is considered especially important in class settings, where significant issues are often discussed in terms of their personal relevance and meaning. Lastly, physical space is abundant on the property, which is full of unique nooks and crannies that can be used for reflective purposes.

Genuine relationships and caring are of supreme importance for this school. Many of the professors at the university have moved to this small town of 3000, in order to be more closely involved with the school and deepen its sense of community. While professional boundaries are always upheld, many of them even invite students into their houses for meals or other events. Living in residence is mandatory at SSU, as they believe that the experience of living in close proximity to others is a valuable life tool. 

Within this context of genuine relationships and consequently acceptance, creativity flourishes. The school brims with artists of all kinds: musicians, sculptures, painters, poets, and more. Each year the school hosts a fantastic arts night featuring student compositions and works. Furthermore, students are specifically invited to use their creativity within the community for purposes of social justice and healing. In general however, the focus of the school is to promote academic excellence combined with competence in life. Overall, this produces highly motivated students unlike many other Canadian universities, whose students often report the contrary.

'''A Translation into Our World'''

Within the public school setting (at both elementary and secondary levels), deliberate considerations need to be made about the quality of the community the students and teachers are both involved in. While this is certainly related to external factors, perhaps the greatest factor is internal: the vision that unifies a school’s staff, and the degree to which its teachers adhere to it. Even if we as teachers, find ourselves in schools that do not overtly mandate their governing members to the necessity of genuine relationships or to the use of mindfulness, we ourselves can make choices to orient ourselves in such ways, and perhaps thereby provide the help and encouragement that students need to survive in such hostile places.

'''Waldorf Education''' 

'''History'''

Waldorf education has its roots in the spiritual-scientific research of the Austrian scientist and thinker Rudolf Steiner.  In April of 1919, Rudolf Steiner visited the Waldorf Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany. Germany, defeated in war, was on the brink of economic, social, and political chaos. Steiner spoke to the workers about the need for social renewal, for a new way of organizing society and its political and cultural life.  
Emil Molt, the owner of the factory, asked Steiner if he would establish and lead a school for the children of the employees of the company.  Steiner agreed but set four conditions: 1) that the school be open to all children; 2) that it be coeducational; 3) that it be a unified twelve-year school; 4) that the teachers, those individuals actually in contact with the children, have primary control of the school, with minimum interference from the state or from economic sources. Steiner's conditions were radical for the day, but Molt gladly agreed to them. On September 7, 1919, the independent Waldorf School opened its doors.
There are now more that 900 Waldorf schools in 83 countries around the world, Waldorf education is the fastest growing independent education movement in the world.  

'''Developmental Structure'''

The structure of the education follows Steiner's pedagogical model of child development, which views childhood as divided overall into seven-year developmental stages, each having its own learning requirements; the stages are similar to those described by Piaget.

'''Early Childhood'''

Waldorf schools approach learning in early childhood through imitation and example. Extensive time is given for guided free play in a classroom environment that is homelike, includes natural materials and provides examples of productive work in which children can take part; such an environment is considered by Waldorf pedagogues to be supportive of the physical, emotional and intellectual growth of the child through assimilative learning.

'''Elementary School Years'''

Waldorf schools regard learning at this stage as artistic and imaginative. The elementary school centers around a multi-disciplinary arts-based curriculum that includes visual arts, drama, artistic movement (eurythmy), vocal and instrumental music, and crafts.

'''Adolescence'''

To meet the developing capacity for abstract thought and conceptual judgment Waldorf schools place the emphasis on learning through intellectual understanding and ethical thinking, including taking social responsibility.  Although education now focuses much more strongly on academic subjects, students normally continue to take courses in art, music, and crafts. Pupils are encouraged to develop their own independent and creative thinking processes. 

'''Mind, Body, Spirit''' 

The specific goals of Waldorf education are:
1.   Creative thinking including: imagination, flexibility, and focus
2.   Emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-esteem
3.   Physical vitality, stamina, and perseverance
4.   Spiritual depth gained through an appreciation and responsibility for nature, work, and for their fellow human beings
Waldorf education addresses these goals through interdisciplinary, integrative practical, artistic, and intellectual elements, and coordination with the natural rhythms of everyday life. The Waldorf approach emphasizes the role of the imagination in learning, developing thinking that includes a creative as well as an analytic component. 

“For us being human is to be artistic and to express yourself through the arts. So for us it's not a tacked-on added extra, we try, certainly in the younger years to make every lesson artistic. We start with music, we have verse, we draw in books, we express visually, all of these things give the child security, and it also fosters in them a feeling for other people, and a feeling for beauty, which for us is very central to living.  ” Andrew Hill, Waldorf Class Teacher

Waldorf education is designed to simultaneously foster creativity and mindfulness or emotional intelligence. Waldorf students acquire the ability to express themselves through painting, drama, music, crafts, movement, and writing. All lessons are reinforced through the learning community that is established around each class where one teacher, one group of children, and their parents remain together for eight or more years. Waldorf education fosters self-esteem by recognizing that each child brings gifts above and beyond the ones that can be measured on an exam. The book, Habits of Mind, published by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, relates a series of attributes that describe what intelligent people do when they are confronted with problems that are seemingly unsolvable. These attributes, such as: Persisting, Managing Impulsivity, Listening with Understanding and Empathy, Thinking Flexibly, Gathering Data Through All Senses, and Responding with Wonderment and Awe, are woven into the Waldorf approach to education.

'''Recommendations for Mainstream Education'''

The holistic, spiritual, creative and mindful basis of Waldorf education is considered to be a healing education that would benefit all students regardless of ability or need, an education that is universally designed.  Mainstream educators have recommended the integration of the arts into traditional content, a pedagogy that embodies the American psychologist Howard Gardner’s “Theory of Multiple Intelligences” and the current trend in education of Differentiating Instruction, as an effective stimulator of spiritual-aesthetic, intellectual and physical development as seen in Waldorf education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ART EDUCATION FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED==
===Thesis=== 

Art education is essential for a well-rounded academic program that contributes to higher order thinking skills across all disciplines.  Art education provides children with a fully integrated appreciation of culture and community.  Art is a powerful means of expression that enables the child to develop a wide range of skills such as: leadership, teamwork, communication, self-discipline, self-expression &amp; creativity.  Art education has many benefits and students with special needs should not be excluded, however, often teachers are ill informed of the variety of ways to integrate a child with special needs in the arts classroom.  This paper will discuss: the importance of learning visual art, understanding visual impairments, how to foster an inclusive atmosphere, motivation as well as provide an array of teaching strategies in the visual arts classroom for the blind and visually impaired student. 

===The Importance of Learning Visual Art===

In the 1980’s arts education for the blind was thought to be unimportant or impossible, there was a clear need to be met- busy teachers needed not to reinvent the wheel but the blind and visual impaired students needed not to be excluded.  Some may inquire, “Why teach art to people who are blind?” People with sight loss/impairment are as likely to have a need to make and appreciate art as those with sight, their mental visual activity continues even after loss of sight and engagement in the visual arts is possible regardless of the degree of their visual activity.  Despite a students abilities, arts education will help all students develop critical thinking skills, language skills, cooperative learning, self-awareness, self-confidence, sensory development (there is multi-sensory art experiences in the creation of art) and manual dexterity (working with a variety of tools and materials). 

===Understanding Visual Impairments===

Studies indicate that 10-20% percent of people considered legally blind are totally without sight, and 20% of school-age children are visually handicapped have no useable vision.  However, 80% of visually impaired individuals have some residual vision that can be used in daily activities (Besr &amp; Corn, 1983).  This information aids art educators in understanding why the majority of people who are blind are able to respond to some visual stimuli, and why their visual memories act to enhance the creation process.  There are three main categories of vision loss: Loss of central vision caused by disease, loss of peripheral vision and or overall blurring or haze.  However, we must be mindful that not all visual impairments are the same, for example, in a classroom with all visually impaired students, each student will have individual characteristics to their sight loss or impairment.  Student’s functional needs will also vary, some students may use vision for aspects in learning whereas others will not, it is of importance for all educators to familiarize themselves with a students IEP so that they may accommodate their individual needs.

===Fostering an Inclusive Atmosphere===

In order to implement inclusiveness in the classroom it is important to be aware of any form of stereotyping, for example, blind and visually impaired people relate to the visual arts in a variety of ways, just as sighted people.  Some students may enjoy tactile contact with art while others may demonstrate very little interest in touch as a means of artistic or aesthetic experience, regardless of the characteristics or degree of their visual handicapped.  Some students learning and appreciation of the arts involve creative process and imagination, rather than merely touch as a means of art education. These student would benefit most by stimulating their visual memory, you can achieve this by describing an event, place or object, which may trigger their memory and personal experiences. Personally, I may evoke this in the students to trigger various levels of emotion, which may allow them to produce astonishing works of art that are highly emotive and self-expressive.  According to Rogow (2000) people with visual impairments rely on their environment as a crucial role in providing a means to explore the world around them; when vision is absent language serves as a means to establish and maintain contact with other people.  Educators must avoid phrasing instruction with: “This or that, here or there” to avoid confusion, you must be able to communicate with specific verbal instruction, doing this will allow the visually impaired student to feel confident &amp; included in the classroom.  Dokecki (1966) states that it is important for teacher to use verbal communication naturally, and not hesitate or avoid using words such as “see” or “look” because visual terms are necessary for all student to have complete competence in language so that they may participate as functional members in society.

===Theory: Motivation===

Once you establish a friendly and trusting relationship with the student an approach to help motivate them is to build their self-esteem and confidence by sharing with them famous artists that had visual impairments, including but definitely not limited to artists such as: Monet, Van Gogh, Degas and Rembrandt etc..  There are also many contemporary artists with visual impairments that you may wish to invite as guest speakers or to conduct a workshop, perhaps you may even wish to take you class on a field trip to view an exhibition by these artists.

===Specific Strategies for the Visual Arts Classroom===

Initially, it is essential to integrate the student with impaired vision into the classroom by describing the configurations of room, if you must change the position of furniture in your classroom remember to describe the new configurations to the student.  Teacher should also inform students that use optical devices that they may move closer to diagrams or demonstrations. Educators must also accommodate students by eliminating clutter, placing materials within reach of the student and being mindful of the size, colour and contrast of print on handouts.  Lighting is also of importance for students with impaired vision, some may find window glare and light reflecting off shiny surfaces unbearable, to accommodate them you can position demonstrations in other places in the classroom, adjust shades and allow students to move seats if so desired. It is also wise to identify yourself when you approach a visually impaired student as well as seek permission from the student before you physically guide them to an object.  Teachers must be mindful that a person classified as legally blind may still have usable vision, in which it does not significantly alter functional ability and it is important to realize that a legally blind person may be able to function visually for a variety of tasks.  However, some students with visual impairments may need to look off center to see things more clearly, it is important not to interpreted that as inattention or negatively on the part of the student.  

Visual Art teachers may question to what extent a blind person can appreciate and create art and to whether or not they have the necessary knowledge in order to provide the blind or visually impaired student with the best arts education.  An educator may inquire- Can blind persons learn about different art styles?  Can blind people learn as sighted people do to identify different time periods?  Blind people can learn to understand perspective in a tactile drawing, but can they learn to understand perspective in an artwork?  Are blind or visually impaired people limited to sculpture or can they learn to draw? What are light, colour and form to a blind person?  Perhaps we can better understand a visually impaired or blind person if we attempt to comprehend a glimpse of their experiences. For example, lets us imagine that we are nearsighted and we remove our glasses to watch television, the images are not being viewed as intended by the network but rather the images appear dream-like with patterns and construed colour, for some this may be a negative experience but for the artist, this is a rare and amazing gift.  This experience opens the artists up to a world where her or she is able to transform these experiences into personal interpretation based on only how they see the world.  Parents and arts educators should encourage this and assist the students by stimulating their visual memory and or emotions.  People that are blind or visually impaired have the ability to draw quite accurately; they are able to transfer knowledge from exploring the world around them to depicting vantage point and perspective in their artwork.  For e.g., they are able to understand and draw the side-view and top-view of a vehicle and they can identify foreground and background- they know that the girl standing in front of the tree is larger in the picture plane then objects in the distance.  Revensz (1950) concluded that people with visual impairments do have some form of spatial perception, which was based on the records from Von Senden’s 1932 study of people with visual impairments (pp.86). However, Revensz also proposed that people with visual impairments cannot “properly” perceive beauty or create artistic images (pp87). Quite frankly, I find that statement rather appalling because his definition of beauty and creation is defined by the sightless person not being able create works of art based on their inability to see object’s in this world of all it’s beauty, nature &amp; glory. He states that the blind person is limited to only the “material sphere” but who is to say that beauty can only be expressed through ones visual experiences, on the contraire I believe what restricts many artists in the creation process is over-analyzation, responding with minimal sight to a stimulus can inspire remarkable works of art that are beautiful, memorable and emotionally compelling!  “Only when he no longer knows what he is doing does the painter do good things” (Degas).

===Equipment, Material &amp; Instructional Suggestions===

Other things to consider is equipment and materials in the classroom, such as: enlarging devices, magnifying lens, three-dimensional Marquette’s and tactile materials such as drawing boards (which add great tactile and/ textural elements to the composition), raised-line paper, raised-line drawings of images, diagrams, charts &amp; illustrations.  Raised-line drawings will assist the teacher in explaining art history to the blind or visually impaired student.  The use of visual storyboards and technological aids may enhance the concept of the lesson or demonstration.  When teaching painting, place colour in the same order on the palette from left to right- white, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, green, brown and black.  Use non-spill containers for liquid mediums and place paint containers in a narrow lipped tray, organize all dry mediums (For e.g., Conte, pastel, colour pencils etc.) in a specific order and keep all heat emitting equipment in a safe and controlled area away form traffic zones.  Students that are blind or visually impaired enjoy working with high contrast mediums, so it is feasible to have some bright paint available.  Lastly, check frequently for the student’s comprehension as instruction proceeds and be mindful of background noises that can make instruction inaudible. 

===Conclusion===

Students with special needs will enter our classrooms, we as Art Educators need to share our passion for the arts with these students, often these learners are “overlooked” or “worked around” because of our lack of tools or knowledge, however the best way to inquire this knowledge is to get to know our students, to further educate ourselves of their needs as well as to encourage them to expressed themselves and to take risks in their work.  Art educators need to provide blind and visual impaired children with the same opportunities as their peers, by being mindful of any stereotyping, by teaching them art skills, by exposing them to a variety of mediums and through teaching them about great art in order to encourage art appreciation and a love for life-long learning.

==SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS IN THE MUSIC CLASSROOM==
===Thesis===

Being an arts educator to special needs students is both a rewarding and challenging task.  Teaching the arts, specifically music, can be a motivating and fun way to teach all children, especially those with distinct learning needs.  Essentially, the purpose of this paper is to show the benefits of teaching the arts, in specifically music, to students with special needs, to express the importance of creating an inclusive environment in the classroom, and to also discuss certain strategies, resources, and ideas to use in the secondary school level to help special learners succeed.  

===The Importance of Learning Music===

It is important to note the benefits that learning music can have on a child’s growth and development.  Firstly, music has been shown to help students who are cognitively challenged.  For example, learning through songs works as a mnemonic device to assist in memory and learning by organizing and breaking down information into pieces, thus, making it easier for a student to retain and encode what they are learning (Lazar, 2008) . Thus, when teaching a student a concept such as the alphabet, the months in a given year, or a historical figure, if taught through a song, there is a greater chance that students will learn and retain these concepts easier.  Teaching music has also been shown to benefit students with communication barriers.  Essentially, singing and speech share many similarities because when a person sings, this requires them to use their speech as well.  For example, songs of varying lengths can increase the duration of a child’s speech, while rhythm can be used as a timing cue to aid in speech pacing and intelligibility (Lazar, 2008). Thus, music can be used as a means to improve a student’s functional communication.   Lastly, learning music has been shown improve and develop a child’s gross motor skills.  Research shows that basic skill areas such as visual-motor integration, bilateral integration, imitating movement, or crossing midline can be targeted with rhythmic activities (Lazar, 2008).  For example, learning a particular dance style, or learning songs such as The Hokey Pokey, provide opportunities for the growth and development of a variety of motor skills.  Thus, the aforementioned information exhibits how music can positively impact a child's growth and development.     

===Fostering an Inclusive Environment===

When teaching special needs students, it is crucial for an educator to foster inclusion in the classroom.  Implementing an inclusive atmosphere allows all students to feel valued, included, and appreciated.  There are a variety of considerations for inclusion in the classroom that educators should be accustomed to.  Firstly, it is crucial for an educator to know their students.  For example, if a student has an Individual Education Plan (IEP), it is imperative for an educator to read through that student’s IEP and find out as much about the student’s disability as possible.  From this, an educator can deduce what services the student might need in the classroom, what the strengths and weakness of the student are, etc.  Also, it is important for educators to know their colleagues and the Special Ed staff within the school.  Resources such as these can offer a wealth of strategies pertaining to how certain students learn best, and also how to interact with particular students.   Thus, by researching and examining the disabilities of students in the classroom, an educator can make the proper accommodations and modifications which will not only ensure student success, but will also create an inclusive environment. 

===Theory: Motivation===

There are a variety of specific strategies that a secondary school educator can utilize in order to meet both the needs and interests of special learners in the classroom.  For example, if an educator comes across a student with a physical disability, how would they go about choosing a suitable instrument for them to play?  When selecting musical instruments for students with special needs, as with any other student, it is crucial for an educator to be aware of what motivates and interests the student.  This is a most important factor when choosing suitable instruments, because special learners will often overcome enormous odds when they are determined and inspired to do something (Hammel, 2004).  Also, when learning a new musical instrument, especially if no prior knowledge in music is evident, motivation and persistence are both essential.  Thus, when students are motivated, there is a greater chance that they will succeed which is why an educator must ask themselves, “What instrument holds the most attraction for the particular student?

===Specific Strategies for the Music Classroom===

Although motivation is key in terms of choosing a suitable instrument for an exceptional learner, depending on the student's needs, there may be a limit as to what instrument that student can play.  This is why exceptional learners need to be individually evaluated to determine both instrument preference and instrument suitability related to their particular disability. Nonetheless, there are a variety of instruments that can be adapted to suit the needs of all students.   For example, the piano can be adapted for one-handed players.  Essentially, a pianist who uses one hand will need music that combines the melody line with the accompaniment.  Fortunately, there is a vast selection of repertoire of music available for left-, or right-handed piano players.   Although standard brass instruments such as the trumpet are played right-handed, it is possible for it to be played left-handed.  In essence, only one hand is involved in forming the notes of the trumpet, whereas the other is used to support the instrument.  Thus, to compensate for this, all the teacher has to do is provide music stand which in turn, would support the instrument.  Lastly, stringed instruments can be adapted for one-handed players.  This can be done by playing with the bow in the left hand, and also, by bowing with a prosthesis.  Thus, when selecting instruments for students with special needs, it is crucial for an educator to be open-minded and accommodating.  


Lastly, there are a variety of ways to adapt and modify specific music for students with visual and learning disabilities.  For example, one way a piece of music can be altered is to have the student highlight the alternate staves.  Doing this would benefit a student with a visual impairment, or one with a learning disability who has trouble processing and following information.  Another way to modify a piece of music would be to write out all of the accidentals found within the key signature in front of the corresponding note(s).   This would be beneficial to a student who is cognitively challenged and has difficulty perceiving organizing information, as well as linking specific details together.  In more extreme cases, a final option would be to simplify the music by including only two or three notes.  The educator could then gradually add the rest of the notes onto the music once the student progresses and feels comfortable.  Thus, there are a variety of ways in which an educator can modify a specific piece of music to suit the learning needs of his/her students.

===Conclusion===

Therefore, the aforementioned information clearly shows how an educator can integrate, accommodate, and include special learners into a High school music classroom.   Moreover, one can see the importance that learning music can have on a student’s growth and development.  Also, the abovementioned information shows how many things in the music classroom, such as instruments, and the music itself, can be adapted and modified to suit the needs of special learners.  Doing this would allow special learners to experience and feel a sense of belonging and inclusion in the classroom.  Thus, although teaching and integrating special needs students into the classroom can be a challenging task, the rewards of seeing those students succeed despite the odds, significantly outweigh the challenges that the teacher and student could experience.

'''''What is an &quot;At Risk&quot; Student?''''

There are varying ideas as to what an at-risk student is.  Some suggest that an at-risk student is simply a student who is danger of 1) low academic achievement; or 2) dropping out of school.  However, this over simplification leads to dissent about whether or not those two criteria are actually worth the worry and that students who are defined as at-risk may still have successful and fulfilling lives.  Edward Rozycki writes in his article'' Identifying the &quot;at-Risk&quot; Student: What is the Concern?'': 

:::''Does low academic achievement in the lower grades, in high school, even, condemn one to a life of despair and ruin? I would think not. People mature at different rates and may not be able to take advantage of school offerings until well past their teen years. This is why community colleges have grown up. This is also why many traditional universities have special admissions programs. To pretend that life is over if high achievement has not happened before age 18, is to approach hysteria.
What about &quot;dropping out&quot; of high school? One of the things researchers complain constantly about is the vagueness of the term &quot;dropout.&quot; A student who &quot;drops out&quot; of a given high school may enroll in another. The statistics may not be adjusted to reflect this. Or she may complete a GED and go on to college through special admissions. Or she may go to community college, make up her high school work and go on to a four-year program. Or she (or he) may get a technical certificate, get a job in industry and continue her education in the corporate world.''

This definition relies heavily on statistics and grades.  Rozycki does not agree that one can only look at 'at-risk' students as being those who are in danger of getting 'bad grades' of dropping out and believes that the definition of 'at-risk' needs to be broadened.  

In his book ''Practical Classroom Strategies'', Michael Tudor gives a much better description of an at-risk student.  He states that:

:::''The term 'At-Risk' has been used to describe a population of students who are experiencing an unsuccessful education.  These students have not acquired the skills which society thinks is necessary to transfer to post secondary education or even to join the work force.  At riskness can cover problems ranging from incomplete homework and skipping classes to dropping, drug addiction, and suicide. '' 

This definition not only describes students at-risk for problems in school but also students who will be at-risk for having problems in life.  This definition supports the need to identify and aid those students who are at-risk in our school systems so that they can move on to post-secondary destinations with success.
  

'''''How does a student become at-risk?'''''

There are several factors that might play a role in creating an at-risk student. 
 
a. Living in high-growth areas

b. Living in unstable school districts

c. Being a member of a low-income family

d. Having low academic skills (though not necessarily low intelligence);

e. Having parents who are not high school graduates

f. Speaking English as a second language

g. Being single-parent children

h. Having negative self-perceptions; being bored and alienated; having low self-esteem

i. Pursuing alternatives; males tend to seek paid work as an alternative; females leave to have children or get married

j. Mental/physical illness

h. Not liking one's teacher or classmates (uncomfortable in the classroom/poor learning environment)


'''''How to Identify an &quot;At-Risk&quot; Student'''''

To help at-risk students, a school has to first identify those students who are at-risk and exactly where they need help in order to get them to become successful.  To do this, you cannot only look at a students grades or attendance, although those are both helpful factors in the identification of at-risk students.  Some students may only find themselves at-risk in one subject area but doing perfectly well in another or a student may be doing well academically but be at-risk of dropping out due to depression or to find work to help a low income family.



'''''The Program - ArtSmarts'''''

'''''Assumptions that Underpin the Program'''''

The ArtsSmarts program is often implemented in schools with a history of poor achievement and attendance, behavior problems, low parental involvement, and high staff turn-over.  The program operates on the assumption that integrating arts into the curriculum and into the classroom will improve the school experience for students, resulting in greater engagement of students in school.  Arts educators often contend that the arts and cross-curricular learning help students develop positive attitude toward school and others (less behaviour problems, more participation, and improved attendance); a sense of community and belonging; thinking skills, including improved comprehension, interpretation, and problem solving abilities; and a better self-concept of themselves as students because of their achievements in the arts, a strong work ethic (persisting in the face of difficulties). 

Today we recognize that not all students learn well through traditional methods: learning through the arts allows teachers to reach out to multiple intelligences by utilizing various different instructional strategies.  The arts are fun and make students feel good about themselves: in a supportive, creative classroom, the arts encourage enthusiasm, curiosity, interest in the learning, and build self-esteem.  Additionally, integrative activities help create a positive, emotionally connected learning environment and encourage the cultivation of closer relations between students and their teacher. Because students are more engaged in their learning and they may begin to experience small success, which helps them develop self-esteem, leading them to work harder and taking pride in their work.  


'''''Psychological Theories seen in the Program'''''

The most important theories seen in the ArtSmarts program are motivational theories. This program is designed largely to improve students' motivation to study a variety of academic subjects by incorporating arts and creative tasks into these subjects. This program gives students ownership of their artistic projects, such as murals or maps, and allows them to personalize their subject knowledge and make it relevent to their lives. This is an example of how the ArtSmarts program increases intrinsic motivation in students. Students are motivated by their desire to succeed and their pride in their own work, rather than extrinsic factors such as grades or material rewards. 

This program also relates to the Humanistic view of motivation, which emphasizes personal freedom, choice, self-determination and striving for personal growth. This program allows students to learn science, math, geography and other subjects in a way that allows them to make artistic choices, challenge themselves and grow through seeing their project through to completion. This program also builds self-esteem and self-worth and associates these with learning and school. Students begin to feel good about their school work and associate their positive feelings of self-esteem with learning, perhaps for the first time!

ArtSmarts also relates to the sociocultural views of motivation, which states that people engage in activities to devlop knowledge as they maintain their identities and interpersonal relations within a community. In other words, students learn how to be students through watching their peers and teachers. In this case students also learn how to be creative through watching community artists. They also witness these artists' learn through their work, providing lessons about life-long learning as well. Students improved self-efficacy through seeing others create tasks vicariously, thus improving their own performace or desire to complete similar activities, knowing they can be successful in this as well. Through watching community artists and their teachers participate successfully in these activities, students begin to find these artistic academic activities meaningful and worthwhile.

Finally, this program allows students to learn how to set goals. Students set goals about their individual works, creating mastery goals about mastering the artistic task set before them. Students also set social goals for interacting with their fellow artists on large projects. Many students will also set performance goals, to avoid looking stupid or inept in front of their peers, which will motivate them to put more effort into their school work. 

Of all the psychological theories we have studied in class, this program is most strongly tied to motivation. Students in ArtSmarts find meaning in the curriculum through working on authentic, artistic tasks and find positive reinforcement for academic work. For some at-risk students this program may be the first time they receive this positive reinforcement in a school atmosphere, which may deter negative behaviour and increase their engagement in learning. 

'''''Support for the Program'''''

In his studying of arts-based programs, Wahlstrom (2003) noted in that students who were not usually class leaders frequently took on leadership roles in the arts-integrated lessons, and children with disabilities of all types were more fully integrated into arts activities than other classroom activities.  Standardized tests of creativity also showed more highly developed creativity in students who participated in an arts-based program (Caslan 22). In surveys of the ArtsSmarts program, teachers, students and artists all reported positive changes in student behaviour, including increased attendance, homework completion and engagement in class, and fewer behavioural problems. Improved self-esteem students demonstrated strong artistic skills, readily took extra work home and learned more than they normally would. Many teachers observed that normally disruptive students often become focused and produce excellent work in arts activities (Caslan 19).  

ArtsSmart’s developed student questionnaires to explore four components (content, context, process and product, according to Karen Hume’s engagement model), and administered them to a large number of students who were being taught by an ArtsSmarts team.  The results of the survey suggested that students felt that the activities involved in the ArtsSmarts program were challenging and beneficial.  Students also indicated that they felt that through hard work they could be successful in all of the activities they were involved and that the activities motivated them to work harder and to feel proud of the work they had done.  (ArtsSmarts, Deconstructing Engagement 9-16).

The majority of students (78% agreed, 18% disagreed, and 4% were missing) were proud of the work they did in ArtsSmarts; most of the students (81% agreed, 13% disagreed, and 6% were missing) said that they could do even the hardest work on the project if they tried; and over 85% believed that they learned a lot from the artist. More than 80% of students believed that they were thinking more than just doing easy work. (Deconstructing  Engagement 13)

The majority of students (79% agreed, 16% disagreed, and 4% were missing) involved in the ArtsSmarts projects also believed that what they learned in the project could be used in other subjects. Almost 80% said that they would like to do an ArtsSmarts activity again, and most of them (68% agreed, 27% disagreed, and 5% were missing) said they worked harder on this project than any other project before.  (Deconstructing  Engagement 13)


'''''Some problems with the Program'''''

On the ArtSmarts website there are a variety of case studies from schools who have implemented the program. This site does a good job of documenting the program from its implementation to the aftermath. From these cases studies we will discuss the most common problems with the schools, seen in these schools.

Some problems with the program include: lack of support from parents, teachers and administrators, lack of teacher training in the arts and lack of measurable results in attendance and student behaviour. According to a variety of case studies published on the ArtSmarts website, the lack of support from parents stems from the belief that students should be focusing on math, science and literature rather than &quot;wasting time&quot; with the arts. Many teachers lack the necessary training to design and present curriculum material through artistic tasks, and many teachers in previous ArtSmarts schools became frustrated at incorporating the program into their schools. They wondered instead why they could not simply present the material to students in traditional, and in their opinion proven, ways. School administrators sometimes saw the programs as too expensive or cited a lack or resources as their reason for not supporting the program.

Finally, while most schools implemented the program as a way to increase standardized test scores, curb violence or improve attendance, not many obvious signs of improvement were seen in these areas. In some schools standardized test scores actually decreased, but in most they did not change drastically one way or the other. Though teachers reported increased motivation in their students attendence increased only 3-5% at most. Similarly, most schools reported that violence either remained the same as before the program or actually increased during the program.

'''Some ways to improve the program:'''

The most important thing to keep in mind when evaluating the effectiveness of the ArtSmarts program is that most of what the program accomplishes cannot be measured by standardized testing, attendence or incidents of bullying. Standardized tests are content based, and student success depends not only on the knowledge of the material, but also on the amount of sleep students have before the test, their comfort in the environment, nerves, what, if anything, the students have had to eat and other personal factors. Attendence and bullying also depend less on the material presented in the classroom and more on outside factors such as students' family lives, physical and mental health and personality. The biggest noted difference seen in incorporating the ArtSmarts program is the huge increase in student motivation, engagement and pride in their own work. Though these positive changes will increase students desire to put more effort into their school work. Many teachers in the case studies also mentioned an increased sense of community in their schools. These things cannot be easily measured in a concrete way, but are essential to the success of struggling, at-risk students. None of the indicators of success mentioned above can fully measure these things. 

Secondly, many schools implemented this program expecting it to fix all the school's problems. Obviously students are diverse and there is no one solution to fix all social issues found in schools. Though the ArtSmarts program increases motivation, it cannot be expected to fix bullying and attendence issues in the course of a few months or years. This program offers one solution for these issues. Perhaps in order to help improve these issues we need to combine this approach with other solutions, rather than solely improving this program.

Below are some suggestions for improving the program:
* Though ArtSmarts offers grants, schools may need to raise funds
* This program works better in an area with many resources and artists close by. Perhaps technology such as video conferencing, email, webcams and even exchange programs could allow this program to be available for those in more remote communities.
* More professional development opportunities are necessary for non-arts specialist teachers and should be provided and paid for by their schools professional development budgets. Arts specialist teachers could take the lead on these professional development sessions and collaborate to write reference guides, lesson plans or strategies for their fellow teachers.
* A new ArtSmarts school could be paired with a more established ArtSmarts school, to allow for collaboration, resource sharing and an opportunity for teachers and administrators to learn from their mistakes.
* The ArtSmarts program alone does not provide an all-purpose fix for all school problems. Perhaps this program could be combined with the implementation of peer-mentoring, counselling, leadership programs or community outreach programs, to offer more solutions for issues in attendance and bullying. These issues are complex, and no one solution works for every student.

The most important thing to note about this program is that it makes positive changes in every school it is implemented in, but in different ways. Each school is different, but each sees increases in motivation, excitement, engagement and community. This program does not market itself as a &quot;quick-fix&quot; to school issues. It is accountable and encourages outside investigation of the program to improve ArtSmarts.

===2. Qf3===
This move is a weak opening because it develops the queen too early and subjects it to attack, and deprives the knight of its best square.

As with the similar [[../2. Qh5|2. Qh5]], White hopes for the scholar's mate: 2.Qf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5?? 4.Qxf7#.  In both cases, Black can easily avoid the trap. However, the Parham Attack is more forcing and stronger -- first requiring Black to defend his e-pawn (usually with 2...Nc6), then after 3.Bc4 forcing Black to play a sub-optimal move (3...g6 virtually committing Black to a fianchetto rather than a more aggressive placement of the bishop; 3...Qe7 blocking the bishop; or 3...Qf6 taking away the knight's best square). 2.Qf3 places no such impediments on Black's development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Arts and Science/Technology'''&lt;/big&gt; - (Hassan, Irene, Tearney, Mark)

“We must not forget that computers are tools, not ends in themselves.”  This is a statement made by Diane Ravitch, a historian, in her article The Great Technology Mania about the implications of trying to succeed at maximizing student achievement through technology.  She goes on to make an even bolder statement about their being “no evidence that use of computers or the Internet improves student achievement.”  In an age where computers and technology seem like the silver bullet everybody in the education field has been looking for, Ravitch’s statements come as a surprise.  However, a closer look reveals not only economic implications for this unsubstantiated technological revolution, but psychological ones as well.  Although it is the assumption that “computers improve both teaching practises and student achievement” and that “To make tomorrow’s work force competitive in an increasingly high-tech world, learning computer skills must be a priority” (The Computer Delusion, Oppenheimer) a lot of evidence points to the contrary. 

A case study facilitated by both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem examined computer-aided instruction (CAI) in Israeli classrooms from 1994 and 1996.  Over this period the results reported did not support the view that CAI improves learning. “The researchers’ found that fourth and eighth graders with CAI showed no improvement or even worse performance on achievement tests after CAI began” (The Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions).  What’s more is that some of the fourth graders showed significantly lower math test scores after CAI began.  It is important to note that these researchers didn’t have a bias against technology but simply argued that the “theoretical case for the CAI is not well-developed, and there is good reason to believe that computers can actually be a diversion” (BI for PPS).

What this extends to, with the technological bandwagon overflowing with advocates from the educational side of things is a reallocation of other educational resources.  This is demonstrated in the case above with the Israeli Ministry of Education spending $105 million on computers during the researches three year period – an estimated amount that could have alternately funded about 3500 teachers for one year.  Other examples include The Kittridge Street Elementary School, in Los Angeles, eliminating its music program to hire a technology coordinator and administrators in Mansfield, Massachusetts dropping “proposed teaching positions in art, music, and physical education” (Oppenheimer), and then spending $333,000 on computers.  This is all very interesting considering recent research has suggested that “music and art classes may build the physical size of a child’s brain” and even has more significant influence on student’s success than computers in subjects like math, science, and engineering.

The primary advocate of this type of work is Jane Healy, an educational psychologist who wrote Endangered Minds: Why Children Don’t Think and What We Can Do About It (1990).  In her book she writes that “visual stimulation is probably not the main access route to nonverbal reasoning.  Body movements, the ability to touch, feel, manipulate, and build sensory awareness of relationships in the physical world, are its main foundations”.  Obviously when it comes to computers and their use in the classroom “the senses have...little status”.  “As well she and other psychologists think that computer screens flatten information into narrow, sequential data.  This kind of material, they believe, exercises mostly one half of the brain” (Oppenheimer).

Many research papers have been devoted to looking at arts influence on student’s success and achievement.  What makes this interesting is that Arts education classically steers away from using computers as a means to an end.  One such research paper is Critical Evidence: How the Arts Benefit Student Achievement by the director of Educational Systems Research, Littleton, Colorado , Sandra S. Ruppert.  In this paper Ruppert links several key phases of cognitive development to Arts Education.  These include but aren’t limited to; Thinking Skills, which is encompassed by “reasoning ability, intuition, perception, imagination, inventiveness, creativity, problem-solving skills and expression” (Ruppert);  Social Skills, which is defined by the promotion of positive growth in “social skills, including self-confidence, self-control, conflict resolution, collaboration, empathy and social tolerance”; as well as the motivation to learn which can be categorized by “active engagement, disciplined and sustained attention, persistence and risk taking, among other competencies”.

In other words if we are to prepare students for work in the 21st century computers is not the best way to achieve increased success.  This is emphasized by people that share the concern that computers aren’t the best way to make successful employees.  Kris Meisling, a senior geological-research adviser for Mobil Oil is quoted in Computer Delusion as saying “people who use computers a lot slowly grow rusty in their ability to think.”  What’s even more shocking are the comment Karen Chelini, the director of human resources for LucasArts Entertainment said: “With traditional art training, you train the eye to pay attention to body movement.  You learn attitude, feeling, expression.  The ones who are good are those who as kids couldn’t be without their sketchbook.” (The Computer Delusion)  It is evident then that people on the front lines of hiring for even the most computer driven companies are looking for thinkers and they believe these aren’t the people that learn through a computer.

'''Links Between Arts and Technology in Practice'''

	Amidst all the discourse on the benefits or potential hindrances of new technology in the education system, a handful of maverick entrepreneurs and educators are using technology in arts education to build communities.  Two examples of programs that reach out to struggling youth and empower them with the ability to use new technologies for their own creative development show that while the new media may have some shortfalls when applied in a classroom, sometimes it is just the bridge to lead students back to success in school and out.   One organization, Regent Park Focus, was formed to give the immense youth population in the neighbourhood of Regent Park in downtown Toronto a voice.  The One World Youth Arts Program is a pilot program at Georges Vanier High School where students there are given the opportunity to create music using current music production software.  Both programs show a holistic form of educating the students and empower every individual in the program with a sense of value and shared responsibility, turning more students back into learning and succeeding in school.

	The arts program in Regent Park was created to fill a void that was unraveling the community.   According to current statistics, the percentage of residents under the age of 24 was approximately 44%.   More than 50% of the population in Regent Park does not speak English in the home, and more than 50% are also visible minorities.   The area itself has been the scapegoat for years as a hub of crime and violence, and before there was a great desire on the part of the community to bond together and work collectively to defeat the stereotype associated with that area.
Regent Park is a youth-based organization in the downtown Toronto community of Regent Park.  Students here learn skills and relevant information about new technology related to the arts.  

	The organization was created and led by a group of adult professionals including Adonis Huggins and Steve Blair, who coach youth from around the community to run their video, radio, and music production suites.  
By giving the students creative control, their engagement and sense of self-empowerment is strong enough for give them more autonomy in the development and process, providing opportunities for leadership.  The success of this organization stems from the youth that have benefited from the program who were at-risk, disenfranchised students in what is considered one of Toronto’s “vulnerable” communities.  
Youth and children working in the Regent Park Youth Focus organization are positively motivated to succeed in their group projects through public exhibitions, film fests, and worldwide online access to their work.  They are also interested in their community, feel welcome and safe and do not feel the pressures of grades to push them to succeed in their work at the program.  The benefits are contagious, and once they have seen what a great job they can do in this arena, their confidence will increase and hopefully influence their future goals.

	By putting “culturally relevant pedagogy” into practice, the students will be able to contribute more as they are working within a group of shared interests or experiences.  The radio, video, and music productions that the students create relate to topics that affect their lives, their friend’s lives, and their family’s lives.  This awareness that students develop through these types of organizations foster local advocacy and activism that forms a values foundation upon which students can feel supported by in their educational or career pursuits.  For those who are struggling in school, finding an interest on an area of expertise that they can expand on is often the hook or anchor that helps them steer through the sometimes-rocky path of secondary education.  

	The One World Youth Arts Program is a pilot project created by high school music teacher Stephen Lashbrook.  It is an open level course that students join and learn valuable skills in music production, creating songs and compositions that are entirely their own and speak to their own lives and concerns.  Similarly with Regent Park Youth Focus, the One World Program has shown the highest success with students who are disenfranchised or considered on the margins of the rest of the community.  In other words, anyone who feels like a minority or whoever feels like not enough material in the current education system speaks to them and their own experiences.  Student success creates “positive reinforcement”, which can spread outside the program and into the classrooms and in the communities and creating music and video productions also stimulates “metalinguistic” and “metasymbolic” awareness.  Arts programs incorporating technology is also an example of cognitive apprenticeship, wherein the students acquire skills from an expert and develop a relationship based on this exchange.  As Piaget has argued, youth and adults rarely enter into formal-operational learning unless they are engaged and interested in the material.  By allowing students creative control in a music classroom, the opportunity is risen for the students to be able to express themselves using musical instruments and new technology.  The production media is their “tools” for cultural expression, while their language, style, and message makes up their “symbol systems”.

	The One World Youth Arts program is being supported by the TDSB, and there are hopes that this type of program which has proven to increase student success will spread to more schools in areas where students need it most.  There is a growing demand or need for arts based programs to offer students a more tangible, relevant form of individual expression and by integrating new technologies as well gives students even more technological literacy, creative problem-solving skills, alongside the inherent community-forming bonds that both learning spaces provide and foster.

	Overall, these programs show that mixing technological skill alongside individual creative expression allow students to make their learning more relevant and useful in their lives and career pursuits.  Because they are accessible by all levels and backgrounds, students immediately feel the benefits of an inclusive learning environment where everyone has something to contribute and the products of their labour are given the value they deserve.

'''The CyberARTS Program'''

Ontario's new CyberARTS Program is another &quot;culturally relevant&quot; educational initiative which merits analysis.

CyberARTS is a specialized, multi-disciplinary, integrated arts and technology program available in several Ontario schools: 
:*Don Mills Collegiate Institute 
:*Don Mills Middle School
:*Northview Heights Secondary School
:*Charles H. Best Middle School
:*Western Technical-Commercial School 
:*Lakeshore Collegiate Institute
:*Innisdale Secondary School 

Certain schools, like Don Mills Collegiate, offer additional technology fused courses such as CyberGEOGRAPHY, CyberHISTORY, CyberCIVICS and CyberCAREERS.

The CyberARTS program was created in 1995 by educators who saw a need for enriched learning through the arts.  The student-centered curriculum focuses on project-based learning that integrates arts and technology.  

CyberARTS students spend approximately half of every day studying academic core subjects. The remainder of their day is spent gaining credits in Comprehensive Art, Extended Media, Communications Technology, and Computer Science.  Students may opt to learn Music, Drama, Dance, or Media Studies or take advantage of Co-op opportunities.

As the CyberARTS program is still a very new initiative, course content differs from one school to another.  Consistent among schools is a focus on the Visual Arts.  Units of study include: 
:*Traditional art studio activities
:*In-depth art history and theory
:*Art analysis and appreciation
:*Life Drawing
:*Portfolio Preparation
:*Exhibition Opportunities
:*Career Exploration
:*Co-op

The Arts component is invariably tied to Technical Studies, which include:
:*Advanced Computer Skills
:*Animation: 2D and 3D
:*Graphic Design Principles
:*Ergonomics
:*Desktop Publishing
:*Web Design
:*Digital Photography
:*Multimedia
:*Film and Video Production
:*Consumer Behaviour and Advertising

In addition to learning art, design, and technology, the students are also taught important skills such as organization, work ethic, presentation skills, professionalism, career building and post-secondary education planning.  Thus, the program features a opportunity to complete '''authentic tasks''' – tasks that have some connection to real-life problems the students will face outside the classroom.

CyberARTS is committed to both formal and informal experiences in Cooperative education and in the development of curriculum to provide &quot;real world&quot; projects that extend beyond the classroom.  Educational Partners include Apple Canada, Kodak Canada, Rogers Communications, the Art Gallery of Ontario, Sheridan College and the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design, among others. Partners provide software and hardware support as well as training and educational consulting for special projects and initiatives. 

'''Problem- based learning''' is another important aspect of the program
All CyberARTS students are expected to contribute to the program, school and/or greater community. These community hours will involve student application of their artistic, creative design and technological abilities in a variety of areas, such as:
:*Graphic design for the school newspaper or yearbook
:*Fashion Design for a schooI Fashion Show 
:*Stage Design for the Drama and Music Program 
CyberARTS students are expected to take on leadership roles in these activities as part of the curriculum and skills training. 

Entry to the high school program is based on a successful audition, interview, and application package.   In addition, a portfolio or sketchbook is highly recommended. 

The audition involves completing a creative activity, such as a still life drawing. The interview is with two CyberARTS teachers, a senior CyberARTS student, and often a guest artist. The main purpose of this interview is to see what kind of a person the student is. Can they think outside of the box? Do they have potential in this program? All of these questions and more are explored in this process. The application package includes a student information sheet, an interest and background form, two teacher reference forms, a creative writing piece, and a release of information form. Prospective students are required to have this package into the school of their choice by the beginning of January.

'''Media Arts, Cyberdisciplines and the Use of Cultural Tools'''

Psychologists recognize that culture shapes cognitive development.  A major spokesperson for this sociocultural theory was a Russian psychologist named Lev Semenovich Vygotsky.  Vygotsky’s work began when he was studying 'learning' and 'development' to improve his own teaching.  He wrote about language and thought, the psychology of art, learning and development, and educating students with special needs.  Vygotsky’s work was banned in Russia for many years because he referenced the ideas of Western psychologists.  However, within the last twenty-five years  Vygotsky’s ideas about language, culture and cognitive development were “rediscovered”  and have become major influences in the field of educational psychology.

Vygotsky believed that human activities take place in cultural settings and cannot be understood apart from these settings. He realized that people use '''cultural tools''', including symbolic tools (such as maps, works of art, signs, codes and language) play and important role in cultural development.  Our understanding of “cultural tools” has also expanded to include real tools , such as the abacus and rulers;  today we would add computers, video equipment and the internet. 

Vygotsky upheld that cultures create tools to support thinking and mediate higher order mental processes.   Children’s knowledge, ideas, attitudes and values develop by using and appropriating the ways of thinking provided by their culture. Children transform the tools as they construct their own representations, symbols, patterns and understandings.

Sound familiar? It should, because this is the heart of Media Arts and CyberArts education.  Students of these disciplines sublimate cultural resources, critically process these materials, and construct representations of their understanding of the world around them.   Often, these representations will manifest as works of literature and visual art.  As students learn and grow, they continue to refine their skills and understanding of the world they are part of.  

It should also be noted that Vygotsky promoted a concept of '''assisted learning''', or guided participation in the classroom.  Assisted learning requires scaffolding, giving information, prompts, reminders and encouragement in the right time and in the right amounts, and then gradually allowing students to do more and more on their own.

Appropriately enough, the CyberARTS program uses this same “assisted learning” system. Curriculum is designed so that the teacher is a facilitator, manager, producer, and support, while students take an active role in problem-solving the task at hand, be it creating a publication, authoring interactive DVDs, creating a portrait or organizing a conference.

'''Technology and Public Education:'''
Potentials for Collaborative Teaching and Learning Through Online Communities

Talk to any teacher in the TDSB and they will likely tell you that there is a sustained push from the school board to integrate and expand the use of technology in their teaching and professional development. While the board itself has no publicly available mandate on the subject, a host of technology initiatives at the local and provincial level would seem to uphold this popular impression. Most commonly referred to under the moniker of “e-learning,” these initiatives offer various levels of resources and options for networking, collaboration and education. While their efficacy is in many ways debatable, their integrated presence at all levels of educational policy and delivery in Ontario mark out a community of sorts, which has the potential to fundamentally alter the ways through which both students and teachers learn.

	But what exactly is “e-learning”? And how is it financed and implemented? These seemingly straightforward questions immediately problematize the concept, underlining some inherent flaws in the vision of technologically mediated public education. To begin with, e-learning basically refers to anything done via computer network. So the word itself (like “the internet” before it) is as broad as it is imprecise. It could be almost anything. But for it to be truly transformative within the educational model requires 
up-to-date, functioning hardware and software, which most schools don’t have and can’t afford on an ongoing basis. It also requires technologically adept teachers. Simply buying computers, isn’t enough – fully integrating technology into the curriculum requires ongoing training and professional development. That said, things are changing, however glacial the pace. And the ideas behind e-learning initiatives will continue to gradually change the shape of public education over the years to come.  

	Regardless of the ability of schools to access it, there are plenty of e-learning resources available to teachers and students in Toronto, from the basic to the complex. These include inter- and intra- school networks and resources, online courses and curriculum, and a growing number of peer-to-peer interactive online tools. Most schools, for example, have a “Teacher Share” directory on their network, through which teachers can share resources. It is only accessible from desktops at the school itself (which is a real limitation, as it would be ideal if it could be accessed from home). However it is a handy way for departments, and whole schools, to collaborate on resources. On a more involved level, ABEL (advanced broadband enabled learning, a non-profit service out of York University) is subscribed to by Toronto and York Region school boards and runs workshops and training, as well as developing curriculum and providing a “virtual community,” including access to online collaboration, development and resource tools. The Ministry of Education has it’s own initiative along these same lines: e-learning Ontario aims to be “a facilitator of online education … providing resources to engage students in learning, as well as an opportunity for teachers to share resources with colleagues across Ontario” (Ministry of Education, 2008). And the Toronto District School Board has set up its own detailed and comprehensive set of electronic resources called “cyberlinks.”

	One such link takes you to e-pals.com, a “global community of classrooms” through which groups of students can safely connect and chat online. This site also hosts its own blogging technology and collaborative projects, providing numerous fantastic online opportunities for extending and enhancing the curriculum. In fact, as is the way of the internet, any one of the TDSB-sponsored sites listed above will open up a myriad of further possibilities. The very real problem then becomes how teachers can find the time to sort through them all, let alone use them productively. While part of the value of the board and ministry sites is they are doing a significant amount of filtering and sorting, the sheer quantity of available material is equal parts valuable and overwhelming.

	Because of this, in my experience the most effective way to approach the use of technology in the classroom is with a concrete need in mind. That way, it becomes a focused quest, less about “What can I do?” and more about “How can I do this better with the available tools?” For example, when teaching Art History, I was confronted by the problem about how to source copyright-released fine art images of suitable quality to project in class. This is actually a significant impediment to teaching high school art, as most schools don’t have extensive or up-to-date slide libraries, and all art is copyright-protected. And, as most art is shown via projector, it makes perfect sense that the best solution to this problem would be a central online library of sorts. And as I discovered, this exists in the form of ArtStor.com, which offers educational copyrighted access to tens of thousands of art images that can be projected via the web interface, saved into slide shows, interactively enlarged to focus on pertinent details, and shared between users. It is an example of the kind of really sophisticated interfaces that are starting to exist, and that hopefully our public education will have access to some day soon. 

	A broader pedagogical issue that e-learning in its current form addresses is the hindrances to learning brought about by conflicting schedules and geographic impediments. The ubiquitous wikipedia, acrobat, and google have all developed collaborative tools (wikibooks, acrobat connect, googledocs) through which multiple users can work on the same document from their home locations, which makes group work a more accessible option for students. More significantly, there are a wide range of online courses available through various school boards such as the TDSB’s “Virtual School,” which are supported by the Ontario Ministry of Education’s “Learning Management System.” The TDSB promotes its Virtual School as “a real school operating in an online environment.” It officially opened in September 2000, and has its own teaching staff, guidance, a Principal, library, learning and health resources, as well as a career center, and offers 20 courses, which change annually according to student needs. (Toronto District School Board, n.d.). There are many reasons why students, particular those deemed “at risk,” may be unable to attend regular classes. For them, e-learning for credit courses may be their only option for completing their high school education. And while this type of e-learning carries with it a very real limitation in that it requires home-based computer access, it is clearly a significant improvement in access for many students.

	It should be clear by now that e-learning resources and programming come in all different forms, from the basic to the complex, and address a wide range of pedagogical needs. They present both students and teachers with remarkable ease and flexibility of access, as well as almost limitless resources, provided that the tools and means of access are available to them. Moreover, beyond the advantages and practicalities discussed above, electronically-referenced educational strategies have numerous potential psychological benefits. Technology in the form of text messaging, blogs, Facebook and MySpace has become a central focus in students’ lives, and a primary mode of communication. Raised with a lived understanding of the internet as a basic source for interest, investigation and communication, today’s tech-savvy teens have the potential to benefit significantly from e-learning. Firstly, there is a strong “intrinsic motivation” factor, as it is basically an interest-related activity that is in and of itself rewarding (Woolfolk et al., 2003, p.355). On top of this, as Piaget theorizes, effective educators need to respond to how kids think and problem solve (Woolfolk et al., 2003, p.38), and electronic learning naturally taps into this by utilizing students’ technological knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Moreover, both Vygotsky and Piaget promote social interaction as the basis of cognitive development (Woolfolk et al., 2003, p.43), so it follows that by increasing the scope of student’s interactive relationships, we will be enhancing their cognitive development. 

	Technology is becoming an increasingly relevant tool in our “cultural tool box” (Woolfolk et al., 2003, 44).  It can be seen as both a “real” tool (hardware, software), and a symbolic tool (language, communication protocols). As these tools are developed and refined through usage, the employment of technology through e-learning can be seen to increase not only student learning but their ability to function and succeed in the world. What is particularly interesting here is the particular ways in which community is utilized and developed around e-learning technologies. Existing as a virtual space, these communities nevertheless function as hubs for communication and interaction. And within these hubs, new knowledge is being formed as our “cultural tools” are developed and refined. Where will this take us? In terms of public education in Ontario, e-learning is at a stage when much is possible, and little has taken place. However, through expanding on the notion of what community means, and what a learning environment is, these initiatives are moving education into an interesting and potentially transformative new space.

&lt;big&gt;'''Lesson Plan Example Using Technology and Art Interpretation in a History Course'''&lt;/big&gt;
'''Lesson Title: Who is Napoleon?

Unit: French Revolution and Napoleon

Course: The West and the World, Destination 1'''

Background:
 
Students will have learned about the height and wane of the French Revolution, and maybe have heard Napoleon’s name float around amidst these lessons, but never received a full lesson on him, his military achievements, and his ambition and rise to power.  They will have had lessons on French nationalism, capitalism and slavery, the rise of the middle class in Europe and the declining intensity of the Revolution.


Expectations from the Ontario Curriculum 2005 edition:

S.W.B.A.T...

1.	Draw conclusions based on supporting evidence, effective analysis of information, and awareness of diverse historical interpretation (p.203).

2.	Analyse different forms of artistic expression and how they have reflected or challenged the societies in which they have appeared (p.198)

3.	Demonstrate an understanding of the importance and use of chronology and cause and effect in historical analyses of developments in the West and throughout the world since the sixteenth century (p.196).


Lesson:  Day 1 Part 1 – In Class


Intro and Q+A 							10 minutes


The class will come in and sit in their desks, observing two pictures of Napoleon right at the front of the room, on the black board.

•	Suggestions: J.L. David’s The First Consul crossing the Alps via the great Saint Bernard Pass,1801; http://www.napoleon.org/en/gallery/pictures/files/The_First_Consul_crossing.asp; Adolf Northern’s Napoleon’s Retreat from Moscow; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Napoleons_retreat_from_moscow.jpg 

Above the pictures the central question:

“How do we know who Napoleon was and what role he played in history?”
	
		
1.	What clues can you find in this picture that tell us what is going on? Let’s brainstorm on the board.

2.	How do you think this image portrays a powerful political leader?

3.	Now let’s look at the second picture. Can anyone tell me how this picture is the same or different? Let’s list the similarities/differences on the board.

4.	What kind of man do you think that this person was, according to the picture?

5.	Do you think this image was created at a high or low point in Napoleon’s career?

6.	Who do you think saw this image? How did this influence the public understanding of who Napoleon was and how influential he was at the time?

Students are going to be handed out a different online link to an image of Napoleon.  For the remainder of the class, the students will go to the computer lab and discover the image to which they have been assigned.  


Day 1 Part 2: In Lab

On the computer, they will write a paragraph describing the picture and what it says about Napoleon, at different times of his career.  They may use the textbook to help them tie the image to the related part of Napoleon’s career. 

Once they have completed writing and typing the paragraph, they will send the paragraph to the teacher’s class email provided on the handout.  The teacher will take the text and post it online as part of a class blog, with credit to the students, and links to the images.  This part can be done during class, or overnight if the teacher has extra time.

By the second day, they should have a paragraph ready, and the next class will take place entirely in the computer lab, where they will continue to send the paragraph or read the postings on the class blog. 


Day 2:  In Lab

Students continue to type up their entry into the blog and email it to the teacher. 
The teacher continues to post the entries onto the blog. The remainder of the period is given for students lagging behind in the computer entry process, and for students to read and make notes on the other student’s entries.  By the end of the class, once every student has entered in their post with the url link to the image, every student is expected to read the other entries, and make some small notes on the reading homework of the day.  

Information/images posted on the class blog may be used as part of a unit test.

If some students have completed all the work, they can get a head-start on the homework, which is the textbook chapter reading on Napoleon.  


'''The West and the World   					

Who was Napoleon?  

Student Handout'''

“How do we know who Napoleon was and what role he played in history?”

For this assignment, you are to discover a part of Napoleon’s identity through a variety of visual primary sources.  Every picture each student is going to be assigned to research is unique, from a different part of Napoleon’s life and career.  In your own words, answer the following questions:

1.	At what point in Napoleon’s career was this image created? How was his popularity at that time?

2.	Does this image paint Napoleon in a positive or negative light?  

3.	Does the image focus on his position in politics or his military ventures?

4.	Does the artist take Napoleon’s influence, power, or policies seriously?

5.	Is it propaganda?  How valuable is this image as historical evidence?


Once you have finished making your notes on the image you have been assigned, you will email your response to the following address: makeupanemailadress@gmail.com.  Include in your entry your name, the url link to the image you were assigned, and whether it came from napoleon.org or wikipedia.org.

The entries will be compiled and posted online on a history class website, entitled 
www.createawebsitename.com.  You will be given class-time to read other student’s responses and are required to do so as some information given on the website will likely be used on the final unit test.  This means that the information you provide should be able to help your fellow students understand how Napoleon was portrayed over the years in a variety of situations.

How to set up your class’ blog:

1.	Go to www.blogger.com and follow the steps given on the website to make a blog.

2.	You now have a blog, a webpage that can add pictures (jpegs) and text.  Create an introduction and title for your class, and once the students send their information to your email, copy and paste them onto the blog, 
making sure to credit their name and the website where the url link to the image they’ve researched was found.

3.	If this task is too time consuming for you, you may be able to create an email for the entire class that they can all log in and post onto the site either individually or as a group.  You can set up groups around one 
computer, and each group can log into the site and type their entries in one message.  

4.	Remind students to put their name on the entry, however, since if it is not there you will not know who wrote it.

5.	Give extra class-time to the students to read the other entries, and from their entries to make at least 3 point-form notes on each image.  Students are welcome to make comments on the image, as long as they are suitable.

The following url links are from napoleon.org.  They contain an image, as well as a caption (sometimes) regarding the image.  Here are some samples, but you are welcome to get more from the same website… just number them, print them out and hand them to the students.  Every student will keep that slip with the url, tell you their number (to keep track) and type the url address on Internet Explorer or Firefox and begin researching.

----
==='''Thesis'''===

	When discussing teaching for wisdom and compassion, a great number of forms and methods emerge as to the best practice.  One particular organization has developed many strategies and theories to educate teacher and parents on ways to incorporate wisdom and compassion into their practice and everyday lives.  This organization is called Essential Education and has developed out of basic Buddhist principles, which they have transformed into a method called “The 16 Guidelines”.

	These guidelines are divided into four spectrums that encompass everyday life and behaviour and within each of these spectrums are four of the guidelines the will lead to a wise and compassionate way of life.  The spectrums cover: how we think (humility, patience, contentment, delight); how we act (kindness, honesty, generosity, right speech); how we relate to others (respect, forgiveness, gratitude, loyalty); and how we find meaning (principles, aspiration, service, courage). (www.16guidelines.org)  Though, these principles were drawn from Buddhist teaching, Essential Education has made them universally accessible.  The essence of the Guidelines have basis in almost every religion around the world and have been adapted so that they can be applied in every cultural circumstance.

==='''Developmental Assumptions'''===

	There are many developmental assumptions that underlie this approach to teaching for wisdom and compassion.  Essential Education has a strong focus on educating adults to become instructors and in turn, transferring that knowledge to youth through modeling and formal education practices.  Their youth programs and partnerships focus on youth in their concrete operational to formal operational stages of development, based on Piaget’s theories.  Also, their techniques seem to draw from ideas and theories from people like Erikson, Marcia, Kohlberg and Gilligan.

	During the concrete operational stage of development, youth are in the later elementary to middle school years and are beginning to develop their sense of identity.  This would be when Essential Education recommends beginning infusing the practice of teaching for wisdom and compassion into the curriculum.  It is best to begin in this stage of development because as youth move into the formal operational stage, they begin to make firm connections using hypothetico-deductive reasoning; which is the ability of the formal thinker to consider a hypothetical situation and reason deductively. (Woolfolk, page 36)  If the basis for wise and compassionate living has already been instilled by this stage of development, a youth is more likely to put it into their common practice and use the guidelines as basis for problem solving when using deductive reasoning.

	The Essential Education system also has assumptions that relate to Vygotsky’s socio-cultural perspective; especially the idea that higher mental processes are co-constructed through shared activities. (Woolfolk, page 43)  Co-constructed means “constructed through a social process in which people interact and negotiate (usually verbally) to create an understanding or to solve a problem, the final product is shaped by all participants.” (Woolfolk, page 43)  This idea is key to teaching for wisdom and compassion.  If a student is raised and educated in a culture that puts a major emphasis on the 16 Guidelines to a peaceful contented life, this will become part of the natural behaviour of the student.  Using activities and practices that support these guidelines allows the students to incorporate the learning into all of their practices.

==='''Underlying Theories'''===

	Some of the theories that seem to be a basis for the application of the Essential Education are Erikson, Marcia, Kohlberg, and Gilligan.  Though these theories are not directly referenced within the documents relating to the Essential Education System, their principles and applications are more than apparent in comparison.  Erikson’s theory of the Eight Stages of Psychological Development suggests that at various stages of development the individual faces a developmental crisis; “a specific conflict whose resolution prepares the way for the next step.” (Woolfolk, page 62)  These resolutions can be positive or negative and will affect their later stages of development.  The focus on “how we relate to others” and “how we act” have basis in providing positive outcomes to the crises and help to increase the self-esteem of each of the students by encouraging an accepting and supportive atmosphere in the classroom.  This will allow the students to feel free to move through their personal development and feel safe to share with their peers, knowing that everyone is operating under an attitude of cherishing others and making a better world.

	The theory of James Marcia suggests “that there are four alternatives for adolescents as they confront their identity choices.” (Woolfolk, page 65)  These alternatives are identity achievement (“strong sense of commitment to life choices after free consideration of alternatives”), identity foreclosure (“acceptance of other life choices without consideration of options”), identity diffusion (“uncentredness; confusion about who one is and what one wants”), and moratorium (“identity crisis; suspension of choices because of struggle”). (Woolfolk, page 65)  This ties in directly with Erikson’s theory that most adolescents go through a phase of moratorium during that period of life.  Teaching for wisdom and compassion allows the freedom and opportunity for students to safely journey through this phase of their development.  The focus on finding meaning in life within the 16 Guidelines focuses on the fact that everything is changing and anything is possible.  This is especially poignant for students in the midst of their adolescence, when they are being faced with many life altering changes from physical development to choosing career paths.

	The theorists that most closely relate to the principles emphasized by Essential Education are Kohlberg and the developments by Gilligan.  Kohlberg believes that all people move through stages of moral reasoning, which will ultimately lead to “post-conventional moral reasoning” which is guided by social justice and decisions based on the standard levels of individual rights.  Gilligan challenged this idea, saying that studies based on Kohlberg’s theory showed that women did not achieve this higher level of moral reasoning whereas men did.  Gilligan suggested that this upper level of moral reasoning that focuses on “universal principles of justice and fairness” (Woolfolk, page 80) is achieved by the “principles of responsibility and care for all people” (Woolfolk, page 80), which can be achieved by anyone regardless of gender.  Essential Education’s goal is to aide people in moving into this higher level of moral development and through teaching for wisdom and compassion, students have the opportunity to internalize the standards and practices that are being demonstrated to them daily through their teachers and parents.

	Lipscomb, MacAllister and Bregman discovered that children who had been more exposed to caring, generous adult models were more likely to adopt those same qualities and principles and demonstrated greater concern and caring for the rights of others.  (Woolfolk, page 80) This study shows the effect of teaching for wisdom and compassion.  Youth emulate that which they see, and as a teacher, you have a fantastic opportunity to shape the future behaviour of the students you work with.  The Essential Education program gives guidelines and strategies as to how to incorporate this idea fully into life and interactions with youth.  Creating a better world, begin with creating a more compassionate society.

“The tendency for a person to behave morally is largely dependent on the extent to which moral beliefs and values are integrated in the personality, and in one’s sense of self.  The influence our moral beliefs have on our lives, therefore, is contingent on the personal importance that we as individuals attach to them – we must identify and respect them as our own.” (Woolfolk, page 81)

==='''How Teaching for Compassion and Wisdom is used in the Classroom'''===

:Many teachers in the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) are actively incorporating the principles of teaching for wisdom and compassion into their classroom teaching methods. For example, a drama teacher in Toronto implemented a strategy that incorporates many core elements of improvisational theatre to develop wisdom and compassion in his students. Although this strategy informs many elements of his teaching, this section of the essay will look specifically at his strategy for teaching for wisdom and compassion in a grade 10 drama unit, dealing with children’s theatre. While other teachers in the school who were teaching the same unit focused on creating a “hierarchy” for their units, with each student taking clearly defined roles (director, stage manager, script writer, etc.), this teacher actively fostered a spirit of collaboration, allowing students to work together to create all the elements of the play by themselves. There was a lot of preparation that was needed before he could have the students begin work on the assignment, but it was all done with the intention of creating an atmosphere where students could learn for wisdom and compassion. He planned the unit for later in the year, so he had a good sense of which students could work well together, and he also allowed the students to select a myth from any culture in the world to dramatize and stage. This allowed the students to have a proper foundation to begin working on the project. 

: Through the assignment, the teacher incorporated many of the key elements of teaching for wisdom and compassion. At various times through the rehearsal process, the students were required to write a journal, reflecting on their group’s progress, and how they feel they added or detracted from the group, and what they can do to help their group in the future. This is an example of a reflection technique that is designed to help the students develop a sense of compassion, through introspection, and considering how they interact with others. After the students completed the journal assignment, there was a noticeable shift in group dynamics, as students were made more aware of their positive and negative  behaviour within a group dynamic through this assignment. Aspects of improvisational theatre were also actively used by the instructor. Acceptance of ideas is a core principle of improv, and in teaching the students to respond to new ideas with a “yes and …” or a “let’s try it, and see what happens,” instead of refusing the offer, students gained an understanding how the mental environment they create in a group can allow all the group members to function more effectively. In having the students perform children’s theatre assignments, the students had to reflect on learning and development, as they were required to think about to engage a group of younger students with their performances. This idea of understanding learning and development also appeared in the elements of mask and shadow puppetry that were also brought into the assignment. The myths that they were adapting all had fantastic elements that were impossible to stage in a traditional manner, so in having the students think in the abstract, about different ways to represent reality, but to do it in such a way that a younger audience would be able to understand. 

:While this assignment has many aspects that are designed to teach compassion and wisdom, there were still areas where the teacher met some difficulty. The main issue was motivation. Students would often come late to class, or if they were in class, would occasionally “zone out,” and not be active participants in the rehearsal work going on that day. This would happen most often after many days of straight rehearsal, with nothing to break up the rehearsal routine of “come to class, rehearse and leave” over a span of several classes. However, if a new aspect of children’s theatre was introduced to the rehearsal, simple musical instruments for example, a sense of group focus, energy and willingness to work together returned to the group dynamic. This speaks to the value of using variety, and specifically different forms of motivation, to properly engage a class. While the unit plan incorporates elements from the behavioural approach to motivation (preparation for an upcoming performance, the desire to do well on he assignment) and the sociocultural approach (journals, reflecting on one’s role in a group), the inclusion of the humanistic and cognitive approaches might help not only break up monotony in the rehearsal schedule, but allow the activity to “hook” students who are affected by different forms of motivation. Activities using different forms of motivation, for example having students reflect on their cultural and personal connections to the myth in a short written assignment, might motivate students who respond to the humanistic approach to motivation. Bringing in different elements of children’s theatre frequently (for example, musical instruments) that the students can play with, and use in their rehearsal if they choose, would be a good way to attract naturally curious students who respond to the cognitive approach to motivation. Trying different motivation methods throughout the rehearsal process might allow students to become more engaged in the material, and become more motivated to participate in the collaborative aspects of the group activity, and through this collaboration, be in a position to become more open to the opportunities to learn for compassion and wisdom.

:The teacher who designed this unit has a very strong sense of teaching for compassion and wisdom. The idea of collaboration, community, introspection and critical thinking informs all areas of the classes he teaches. Giving students the opportunity to direct their learning, and choose the path they would like to take with the material, and allowing students to reflect on their behaviour, and the ramifications of positive and negative behaviour is a great first step to successfully teaching students the principles of wisdom and compassion. Although there are still areas of this unit that can be improved with some application of a variety of motivational techniques to keeps students interested, there’s no doubt that students in this class are well on their way to learning elements of wisdom and compassion that will benefit them in the future. Students in his classes learn not only drama and performance skills, but skills that will help the students become wise and compassionate individuals both inside and outside of a classroom.

==='''Suggestions for Improvement of the Program'''===


&lt;u&gt;'''Improving Teaching for Wisdom and Compassion through Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development'''&lt;/u&gt;

'''Intro'''

Teaching for wisdom and compassion can be improved by Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development. Although both Piaget’s theory and the holistic curriculum applies to students in all levels, this section will be focused on students in high school level, since there is strong need of teaching for wisdom and compassion in adolescents. Piaget’s theory provides characteristics of adolescents, which enables educators to understand the importance of holistic education, the advantages and challenges in applying the holistic curriculum. 

'''Characteristics of adolescents'''

In Piaget’s theory, there are four stages; and the students follows under the last stage of the four, the formal operational stage. Students in this level have some charateristics that has significant meaning in education. First, they are able to think in abstract concepts. As the name ‘formal operation’ suggests, they are able to do mental tasks involving abstract thinking and coordination of a number of variables (Woolfolk, 35). Also, they are able to identify all the factors that might affect a problem and then deduces and systematically evaluates specific solutions (Woolfolk, 36). This ability of hypothetical thinking enables them to imagine things, and imagination leads them to be very focused the ideas and beliefs that they have. This makes teenagers egocentric; which means that they assume that everyone else is interested in one’s thoughts, feelings, and concerns (Woolfolk, 36). Moreover, adolescents have imaginary audience- the feeling that everyone is watching them (Woolfolk, 36). This explains why teenagers are often sensitive about how they look. How these characterstics of adolescents can be helpful towards teaching for wisdom and compassion?  

'''Importance of holistic education''' 

Adolescents are perfect for holistic education. They have ability to think hypothetically which is a great tool to compassionate with the others, yet their egocentricism calls for the need of teaching for wisdom and compassion. It is important for them to learn how to be thoughful and compassionate about the others in both individual and social aspects. For individual growth, holistic education provides the best way of effective student learning. How do students learn? Piaget’s fundamental insight was that individuals construct their own understanding learning; learning is a constructive process (38). Accodring to him, students have to be actively involved in the learning process, including both physical and mental manipulation of objects or ideas (39). This idea enties with the focus of holistic curriculum- to step out of the plain lectures and focus on building relationship between body, mind, and spirit.
Holistic education fosters individual growth by stimulating the contstructive learning of the students. However, If teaching for wisdom and compassion means to devleop how to be thoughtful of the others, it would be meaningless to think of holistic education apart from the social context. Although the adolescent egocentrism is part of students’ development, they cannot stay in the egocentric point of view for the rest of the lifetime. It is one of the key roles of the education to help them break out from the egocentric view and be able to think about the others; in other words, be compassionate to the others. Teenagers know that everyone has their own thoughts, feelings, and concerns; the educator’s job is to transfer them from knowing to respecting and understanding. 

'''Steps of applying holistic education'''

If holistic education is that important, a teacher must know how to apply them in classroom. There are steps to do so. The first step is to know what it means to be holistic. Miller said that holistic curriculum means to focus on relationship; between linear thinking and intuition, mind and body; various domains of knowledge; and individual and community (Miller, 73). The second step is to know some characteristics that can be used toward the holistic practice. For example, Miller suggested to use visualization and metaphors to help the students explore the relationship beween linear thinking and intuition, and this is where teenager’s ability of hypothetico-deductive reasoning, which is the ability to generate different possibilities for a given situation can be useful (Woolfolk, 36). With this, a teacher can easily lead them to visualize or to imagine ‘what if I were this person’, which is the first step of forming compassion for the others. 
The next step is to be aware of the challenges in applying holistic practices and find strategites for them. There are various challenges, and the first one is that although Piaget divided stages according to the ages, it is not necessarily that everyone is in the classroom are in the formal operational stage. Piaget suggested that his theory is not universal, and even adults can use formal-operational thought in only a few areas where they have the greatest experience or interest (Woolfolk, 37). A teacher may find some students having difficult times when a problem involves hypothetical thinking. In this case, the teacher needs to help the students to develop the formal operational skills. Woolfolk suggests some strategies to help students to use formal operations such as using visual aids, or teaching in broad concepts using materials and ideas relevant to the students’ lives (Woolfolk, 37). 
Another challenge is the case where students refuse to participate in holistic practices. For instance, Miller suggested meditation, yoga, movement, and dance to build the relationship between mind and body. However, students might not concentrate, interrupt the class flow, or making fun of the others who is participating. This can be explained with the teenager’s imaginary audience; feeling that everyone is watching what they are doing. It is natural for them to refuse to participate in something that they think they might look silly. Therefore, the teacher has to make sure that the degree of the activities is on the level that everyone feels comfortable participating.

== From The Student's Perspective ==

There are various branches of educational philosophy and perspectives incorporated into holistic teaching.  They each existed prior to the definition of holism, conceived at various points during the twentieth century.  It wasn’t until the 1970s, however, that different strands of the work of educators such as Montessori and Steiner, among others, were woven together under the name of holism, a belief in fostering the development of the student as a “whole person with body, mind, emotions and spirit” (J. Miller, ascdnetwork), not just a brain with a memory centre.  Robin Ann Martin has asserted that teachers choosing to work in a holistic manner are finding opportunities to act as community leaders (2000).  In fact, those who teach for wisdom and compassion are practicing what they preach by becoming wholly involved in educating their students instead of simply functioning as an information conduit.  So what can the student on the receiving end of holistic education expect?

First of all, there is no one type of child to which teaching for wisdom and compassion applies.  Any student would benefit from having a teacher who encouraged them to have opinions about their course material, who showed them the interconnectedness of all parts of the world, and who accepted that creative thinking is equally important as analytical thinking.  One necessary trait for the student is openmindedness.  Depending upon the cultural and family background of the student, breaking away from the transmission model (R. Miller 2004) of learning could be difficult.  However, it is an approach which can be learned.  Given the emphasis on process in holistic teaching, one individual’s need to take the time to adapt their mode of thinking would be accepted and not penalized.  On the other hand, an immigrant student adjusting to the traditional Ontarian educational setting would not be treated differently as they adapted to those parts of Canadian education that are different from that in their native country.  However, if the student is not open to change, their success with this style of learning will be limited.  Without their commitment, the teacher is stuck reverting to the traditional methods of “I talk.  You listen.  You memorize.  I test.  You regurgitate.”  While entrenched within the system and successful to a certain point, the transmission model does not encourage holistic growth and will not result in the creation of fully engaged young citizens.  Teaching for wisdom and compassion will.

If a holistic teacher can convey to their students that “who [they] are, what they know, how they know it, and how they act in the world are not separate elements, but reflect the interdependencies between our world and our selves” (Martin 2000), they have succeeded.  The range of development for students exposed to teaching for wisdom and compassion becomes nearly infinite.  So long as the intrinsic motivation of both teacher and student remains at a high level, the end result of the school year becomes fluid.  Classes would need to strike a balance between the more freedom-based educational philosophies (allowing children to set their own learning paths) and critical pedagogy, with the teacher taking a leadership role and provoking students into realizing the moral perspectives related to their field of study and viewing the world through a critical eye.  A child experiencing a combination of critical pedagogy and Montessori philosophy, where the aim is “to explore and experiment according to their own pace and interests” (R. Miller 2004), learns to value their teacher’s input and guidance of the educational experience while simultaneously building confidence in their own thoughts and feelings as well as trust in the reliability of their motivations.

To make a more specific point, the range of development for students taught for wisdom and compassion would have to vary depending on the individual.  After all, this is an educational philosophy that highlights the developmental process of each individual student.  Especially during their teens, people develop the different aspects of their selves at different rates.  One Grade 10 student might gain great benefit from learning to view ideas from the perspectives of others but not make the connection that this learning tool applies to personal growth as well while one of their classmates does.

Ron Miller has stated that a holistic approach to teaching “aims to cultivate the emotional and spiritual life of the growing human being, and to deepen the young person’s awareness of his or her place in nature.”(R. Miller 2005) and that education as an entity should strive to be “dynamic, spontaneous, self-organizing and emergent” (R. Miller 2005).  Those four adjectives sound suspiciously like a description of an ideal life where people respect one another and support each other’s development.  On a cognitive level, the biggest advantage gained by students who experience teaching for wisdom and compassion is learning the skill of critical thinking.  Because of holistic education’s focus on questioning and discussion combined with experiential learning, students learn to reflect on both their own thoughts and actions and those of others.  This skill is often sorely lacking in traditional school systems that focus on rote learning.  On an emotional level, students experience twofold development.  The focus on discussion forces students to listen to the opinions of others who may hold very different opinions or simply come from different family structures or cultural backgrounds.  With equal respect given to all sides of a topic (hopefully modelled by the teacher), students start to empathize with those who are different from them and also get the chance to start developing critical distance.  Put bluntly, it is okay to hate the idea but that does not mean you hate the person putting that idea forward.  Not only does teaching for wisdom and compassion provoke compassion for others, it also encourages emotional self-development.  The encouragement to develop critical distance applies to one’s own thoughts and feelings as well.  A student who can start operating at this level of emotional maturity while still in their teens has a great advantage over their traditionally-schooled peers.  On a spiritual level, the ever-present push to reflect on their own thoughts and feelings and to learn through questioning encourages students to really get to know themselves, to define their own beliefs (fluid though they may be), and to recognize how they connect to their evolving world.  The “flowing interrelatedness of all life” (R. Miller 2007) becomes clear as these three levels of development intertwine, creating a whole student and a whole human being.

[[Image:CR desyuno.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical Costa Rican Breakfast consisting of ''gallo pinto'', fried plantains, an egg, and orange juice]]

'''Costa Rican cuisine''' is known for being tasty, yet fairly mild, with high reliance on fresh [[Cookbook:fruit|fruit]]s and [[Cookbook:vegetable|vegetable]]s. The main staple, known as ''[[Cookbook:Gallo Pinto|gallo pinto]]'', consists of [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black bean]]s, which in many households is eaten at all three meals during the day.

''Gallo pinto'' is also known in some Southern Areas of Costa Rica as ''burra'', though still recognised the name is rarely used as it is mostly referred to as ''gallo pinto''. Also, Costa Rican ''gallo pinto'' is made with black beans, while [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]]ns use [[Cookbook:Red Bean|red bean]]s traditionally.

For lunch, the traditional national dish is called a ''[[Cookbook:casado|casado]]''. It again consists of rice and beans, though this time they are served side by side instead of mixed. There will generally be some type of meat (''[[Cookbook:Carne Asada|carne asada]]'', fish, pork chop or chicken) and a salad to round out the dish. There may also be some extras like fried [plantain]s, a slice of white [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], and/or corn [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortilla]]s in accompaniment.

Fresh vegetables are a primary ingredient in most main dishes, and members of the [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] family are particularly common. These include varieties such as [[Cookbook:zucchini|zucchini]], [[Cookbook:zapallo|zapallo]], [[Cookbook:chayote|chayote]], and [[Cookbook:ayote|ayote]]. [[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]], [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], and [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red pepper]] are other common ingredients.

[[Image:Costa_Rican_Cuisine_Dinner.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Costa Rican dinner consisting of egg on chicken with rice and beans, vegetables, fried plantain, and cooked bananas]]

[[Cookbook:Coffee|Coffee]] and [[Cookbook:banana|banana]] are the two main agricultural exports of the country and also form part of the local cuisine. Coffee is usually served at breakfast and during traditional coffee breaks in the afternoon, usually around 3:00pm.

The Plantain, a larger member of the banana family, is another commonly used fruit and can be served in a variety of ways.  Ripe plantains have a sweet flavor, and can be fried in [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or baked in a [[Cookbook:honey|honey]] or a [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]-based sauce. Green (unripe) plantains are boiled in soups or can be cooked, mashed into small round cakes and fried to make ''patacones''. [[Cookbook:Corn|Sweet corn]] dishes are common traditional meals like ''pozole'' (corn soup), ''chorreadas'' (corn pancakes), etc.

Other Costa Rican food staples include corn tortillas, white cheese and ''picadillos''. Tortillas are used to accompany most meals. [[Cookbook:Tico|Tico]]s will often fill their tortillas with whatever they are eating and eat it in the form of a ''gallo'' [direct translation: ''rooster'', however, it resembles a soft Mexican taco]. White cheese is non-processed cheese that is made by adding salt to milk in production. ''Picadillos'' are meat and vegetable combinations where one or more vegetables are diced, mixed with beef and garnished with spices. Common vegetables used in picadillos are potato, [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green bean]]s, squash, ayote, chayote and [[Cookbook:arracache|arracache]]. Often, picadillos are eaten in the form of ''gallos''.

==Drinks==
The traditional breakfast drink, besides [[Cookbook:coffee|coffee]], is called ''agua dulce'' (&quot;sweet water&quot;) and is made from ''tapa de dulce''. Sugar cane juice is boiled down in traditional ''trapiches'' and put to solidify in molds in the form of conical sections with the top cut off called ''tapas'' which can literally be translated into &quot;lids&quot;. Then some of this ''tapa'' is scraped off and dissolved into boiling water or milk to make the sweet delicious ''agua dulce''.

The traditional drinks for lunch are called ''refrescos'' or ''frescos'' for short, and consist of liquefied fruits diluted in either water or milk and sweetened to taste. They come in many varieties such as [[Cookbook:melon|melon]], [[Cookbook:blackberry|blackberry]], [[Cookbook:strawberry|strawberry]], [[Cookbook:watermelon|watermelon]], [[Cookbook:mango|mango]], [[Cookbook:tamarind|tamarind]], [[Cookbook:Passion Fruit|passion fruit]], [[Cookbook:guanabana|guanabana]] and [[Cookbook:cas|cas]].

Another popular drink is known as a ''granizado'', a [[Cookbook:slush|slush]] drink made of finely [[Cookbook:shaved ice|shaved ice]] and flavored [[Cookbook:syrup|syrup]]. The most popular flavor is ''kola''. This is not the cola usually associated with carbonated soda but a fruity [[Cookbook:cherry|cherry]] flavored syrup. It is sometimes served with evaporated/condensed milk on top depending on the preference of the drinker.

The national liquor of Costa Rica is made from [[w:Sugarcane|sugar cane]] and is called ''[[w:guaro|guaro]]''. Ticos drink ''guaro'' as a shot or mixed with juice or soda. The cost of ''guaro'' is very cheap compared to the ''cerveza'' (beer) in Costa Rica which is run by a monopoly. ''Imperial'' is the most popular and is an American style lager; the ''Pilsen'' is a Bohemian style [[w:Pilsner|pilsner]]; and ''Bavaria'' is offered in Light, Dark or Gold. The Dutch beer, [[w:Heineken|Heineken]], is also produced in Costa Rica but tastes a little different.

== History ==
[[File:Reino de los visigodos-en.svg|thumbnail|The Visigoth Kingdom before the move of the capital to Toledo]]
The Middle Ages borned in Spain with the creation of the Visigoth Kingdom in the 5th Century. It would last until 711, with [[History of Spain/Spain Divided|the conquest of Spain by the Umayyad Caliphate]]. In 409, the Roman Empire was very weak and was invaded by German People from the north. Some of these people, like Vandals, Alans, Swabians and Visigoths, settled in Spain and Portugal. The Visigoths arrived to Spain from the Pyrenees and settled in the middle of the Peninsula. The Visigoths founded a kingdom, with capital in Toulouse. Later, the capital was translated to Toledo. Between the Visigoth Kings highlighted Leovigildo, Recaredo and Recesvinto, who conquered the entire Peninsula. The Visigoths divided their kingdom in five provinces (''provincias'' in Spanish), named ducats (''ducados'' in Spanish). The kingdom was ruled by a king and each duchy was ruled by a duke. The Visigoth Kingdom disapeared in 711, when the king Rodrigo was defeated by Muslims in the Battle of Guadalete river.

== Society ==

The Visigoth society was made up by nobles and farmers. The nobles had the political and military dominion, they were the owners of the lands and they had many riches. The farmers were the majority of the population. A few were the owners of their lands, but the majority tilled the lands of the nobles in exchange of food and housing. The Visigoths adopted the Latin language, the Catholic religion and Roman laws. They lived in villages and their houses were simple. Their jobs were the agriculture and animal husbandry and they were experts in the production of objects with stones and metals.

== Visigothic Inheritance in Spain ==

The Visigoths have bequeathed to Spain their constructions and their goldsmith works. The Visigoths built simple and small romanic churches, made of stone. They producted many jewels with metals and stones.&lt;ref&gt;http://cplosangeles.juntaextremadura.net/web/edilim/tercer_ciclo/cmedio/espana_historia/edad_media/los_visigodos/los_visigodos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Islamic rule ===
[[File:Spanish reconquista.gif|thumbnail|The Reconquista.]]
In 711, Muslim Moors, mainly North African Berber soldiers with some Arabs, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and began their conquest of the Christian [[History of Spain/Visigoths|Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania]]. After their conquest of the Visigothic kingdom's Iberian territories, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and took control of Septimania in 719, the last province of the Visigothic kingdom to be occupied. From their stronghold of Narbonne, they launched raids into the Duchy of Aquitaine.
At no point did the invading Islamic armies exceed 60,000 men. However, those armies established an Islamic rule that would last hundreds of years in much of the Iberian Peninsula and 781 years in Granada.

After the establishment of a local Emirate, Caliph Al-Walid I, ruler of the Umayyad caliphate, removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. Tariq ibn Ziyad, the first governor of the newly conquered province of Al-Andalus, was recalled to Damascus and replaced with Musa bin Nusair, who had been his former superior. Musa's son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married Egilona, Roderic's widow, and established his regional government in Seville. He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife, accused of wanting to convert to Christianity, and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Aziz's assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa bin Nusair, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa's cousin, Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi became the emir of Al-Andalus.
The conquering generals were necessarily acting very independently, due to methods of communication available. Successful generals in the field and in a very distant province would also gain the personal loyalty of their officers and warriors and their ambitions were probably always watched by certain circles of the distant government with a certain degree of concern and suspicion. Old rivalries and perhaps even full-fledged conspiracies between rival generals may have had influence over this development. In the end, the old successful generals were replaced by a younger generation considered more loyal by the government in Damascus.
A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs. The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who only recently had been converted to Islam; they had provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them. This latent internal conflict jeopardized Muslim unity.
After the Islamic Moorish conquest of nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula in 711-718 and the establishment of the emirate of Al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Toulouse and were halted for a while on their way north. Odo of Aquitaine had married his daughter to Uthman ibn Naissa, a rebel Berber and lord of Cerdanya (maybe of all current Catalonia too), in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off Charles Martel´s attacks on the north. However, a major punitive expedition led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux and defeated Odo in the Battle of the River Garonne in 732. A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and leftover Aquitanian armies against the Muslims and beat them at the Battle of Tours in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi; this proved to be the high-water mark of the Islamic conquests in western Europe and of the expansion of Al-Andalus. Moorish rule began to recede, but it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.

=== The beginning of the Reconquista ===

The year 722 saw the first Asturian victory against the Muslims. In late summer, a Muslim army overran much of Pelayo's territory, forcing him to retreat deep into the mountains. Pelayo and a few hundred men retired into a narrow valley at Covadonga. There, they could defend against a broad frontal attack. From here, Pelayo's forces routed the Muslim army, inspiring local villagers to take up arms. Despite further attempts, the Muslims were unable to conquer Pelayo's mountain stronghold. Pelayo's victory at Covadonga is hailed as the beginning of the Reconquista.

A drastic increase of taxes by the new emir Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi had provoked several rebellions in Al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722 a military expedition was sent into the north to suppress Pelayo's rebellion, but his forces prevailed in the Battle of Covadonga. This battle was considered by the Muslims as little more than a skirmish, while the Battle of Toulouse (721), with at death toll of maybe tens of thousands, was mourned for centuries as a large scale tragedy by the Iberian Muslims. However for Pelayo, the Christian victory secured his independent rule. The precise date and circumstances of this battle are unclear. Among the possibilities is that Pelayo's rebellion was successful because the greater part of the Muslim forces were gathering for an invasion of the Frankish empire.

During the first decades, Asturian control over the different areas of the kingdom was still weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, &quot;Ermesinda, Pelayo's daughter, was married to Alfonso, Peter of Cantabria's son. Alphonse's children, Froila and Adosinda, married Munia, a Basque from Alava, and Silo, a local chief from the area of Pravia, respectively.&quot; 
After Pelayo's death in 737, his son Fafila was elected king. Fafila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage.
Pelayo's dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due not to him but to his successors. Alfonso I (king from 739-757) rallied Galician support when driving the Moorish army out of Galicia and an area of that was to become Leon. The reign of Alfonso II from (791-842) saw further expansion of the northwest kingdom towards the south and, for a short time, it almost reached Lisbon.
It was not until Alfonso II that the kingdom was firmly established with Alfonso's recognition as king of Asturias by Charlemagne and the Pope. During his reign, the holy bones of St. James the Great were declared to have been found in Galicia, at Santiago de Compostela. Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond.
The emirate's greatest failing was its inability to eradicate Christian resistance in the Basque country and the Cantabrian mountains. The two resistances, Basque Navarre and Cantabrian Asturias, despite their small size,demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. The resistance in the Cantabrian mountains soon spread to Galicia in the north-west, where the occupying Moorish army was expelled and the territory was incorporated into Asturias. Because the Umayyad rulers based in Córdoba were unable to extend their power into Frankish territory, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Muslim forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias but failed to make any lasting gains against the strengthened Christian kingdom.

=== Fall of the Caliphate ===

The 9th century saw the Berbers return to Africa in the aftermath of their revolts. During this period, many governors of large cities distant from the capital (Córdoba) planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929 the Emir of Córdoba (Abd-ar-Rahman III), the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself Caliph, independent from the Abbasids in Baghdad. He took all the military, religious and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.
After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the Cantabric range. His Christian subjects were largely left in peace, however.
Christian political forces then accused Abd-ar-Rahman III of pederasty with a Christian boy who was later canonized Saint Pelagius of Cordova for his refusal of Abd-ar-Rahman's advances. As part of a pattern of portraying Islamic morality as inferior, the story provided political strength and popular support to the Reconquista for centuries.

Later Abd-ar-Rahman's grandson became a puppet in the hands of the great Vizier Almanzor (al-Mansur, &quot;the victorious&quot;). Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking Burgos, Leon, Pamplona, Barcelona and Santiago de Compostela before his death in 1002.
Between Almanzor's death and 1031, Al-Andalus suffered many civil wars which ended in the appearance of the Taifa Kingdoms. The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors establishing their long wished-for independence. The result was many (up to 34) small kingdoms each centered upon their capital, and the governors, not subscribing to any larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence, had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so. This split into the taifa states caused Islamic presence to be greatly weakened in the face of the strengthening Christian kingdoms to the north. When Alfonso VI brought Toledo under his authority in 1085. Mortified by the concept of being surrounded by the enemy taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain Yusuf b. Tashufin leader of the Almoravids.

=== Almoravids ===

The Almoravids were a Muslim militia, their ranks mainly composed of Berber and African Moors, and unlike the previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions (1086, 1088, 1093) and defeated King Alfonso at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the Taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at Valencia in 1094, due to the actions of El Cid.
Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King Sancho IV, for he lost Rioja to Sancho II of Castile, and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king Sancho Ramirez, King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre, expanding the borders south, conquering Wasqat Huesca deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25 km away from Saraqustat Zaragoza.
Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and Lérida, and also from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis which led to open war among the smaller counties; but by the 1080s, the situation calmed, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.

=== The Almohads ===

After a brief period of disintegration (second Taifa period), the rising power in North Africa, the Almohads, took over most of Al-Andalus. But they would be decisively defeated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of Al-Andalus in the following decades. By 1252 only the Kingdom of Granada remained as sovereign Muslim state in the Iberian peninsula.

=== Emirate of Granada ===

Ferdinand and Isabella completed the Reconquista with a war against the Emirate of Granada that started in 1482 and ended with Granada's complete annexation in early 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered &quot;half a million within the realm.&quot; By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granada's former Emir Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the Alpujarras mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to Tlemcen in North Africa.

Since the death of Franco, Spain rapidly opened up and democratic institutions developed.  In 1986 Spain joined the EU (then known as the EEC) and the country's population has grown because of immigration from Latin America, Africa, the UK and other European countries.</text>

&lt;pre&gt;GET PREFERENCES prefFileName$, prefRecord&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
Feb 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
This statement locates the named preference file and loads the contents of the file into the indicated preferences record. If the size of the record and the size of the file are different, the smaller of the two sizes will be used.

A full example of using the new &lt;code&gt;PREFERENCE&lt;/code&gt; commands can be found on the &lt;code&gt;Put Preferences&lt;/code&gt; reference page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=GET WINDOW=

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;GET WINDOW [#]wndID, windowPtrVar&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement returns a pointer to the window record for the window specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;wndID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;]&lt;/code&gt;. The pointer is returned into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowPtrVar&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; , which must be a long-integer variable or a &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; variable. A window record is a data structure which contains information about the window, such as its current visibility status, current background &amp;amp; foreground colors, and much, much more. In addition, you need to specify a window record pointer whenever you call any Toolbox routine that deals with windows. For information about the contents of the window record, see the &quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-188.html#HEADING188-0&quot;&amp;quot;Window Manager&amp;quot; chapter of &quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot;Inside Macintosh: &quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html&quot;Macintosh Toolbox Essentials, as well as the descriptions of grafPort and CGrafPort data structures in &quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot; &quot;blank&quot;Inside Macintosh: &quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-2.html&quot; &quot;blank&quot;Imaging with QuickDraw.

FB uses the window record's RefCon field to maintain information about the window, including its class, its modality (modal or not), its ID number, and its type. This information is only valid for windows created using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement. You can access this information as follows:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;refCon&amp;amp; = windowPtr&amp;amp;.wRefCon&amp;amp;
class = (refCon&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;AND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp;FF)
isModal = ((refCon&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;AND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp;FF00) &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0)
windowID = (refCon&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;AND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp;FF0000) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 16
windowType = ((refCon&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;AND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp;FF000000) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 24) + 1&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
Your program should not dispose of the window record (i.e., don't pass the pointer to &lt;code&gt;FN DISPOSPTR&lt;/code&gt;). The system automatically disposes of it when you close the window.

&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peek&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; functions look at the 1, 2 or 4 bytes of data which begin at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and return them as a byte integer, short integer or long integer value, respectively. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be a long integer expression, or a &lt;code&gt;Pointer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Handle&lt;/code&gt; variable. The value returned by a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peek&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function will be interpreted either as a signed or unsigned value, depending on what type of variable itÕs assigned to. If the value is not assigned to any variable, itÕs usually interpreted as a signed value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=GET PROCESS INFO=

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;GETPROCESSINFO index%, processName$ [PSN]&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
May, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
A &amp;quot;Process&amp;quot; is something that is currently running on your computer; this includes, but is not limited to things like applications, control strip extensions, and background applications.

The index parameter in this call indicates which process is to be queried. An index value of -1 means that the front process is used. This is generally the running FB application that you created.

Index values of zero or higher represent running processes. You may climb this list, examining processes as you go, until the process name comes back as a null string. At that point, you have exhausted the system's list of processes and you can quit searching.

The process serial number is an 8 byte value (2 long integers) that holds a unique value which cannot be used by any other concurrent process. You create a process serial number as follows:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; psn &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; ProcessSerialNumber&lt;/code&gt;

The following example shows how to display a list of running processes.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; indx&amp;amp;
&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; ProcessName$
&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; psn as ProcessSerialNumber

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GETPROCESSINFO&lt;/b&gt; -1,ProcessName$
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;My name is:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;;ProcessName$;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DEF TAB&lt;/b&gt; 10
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot; indx&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;0x-------PSN------ &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Process Name&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
indx&amp;amp; = 0
&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;GETPROCESSINFO&lt;/b&gt; indx&amp;amp;,ProcessName$,psn
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; ProcessName$[0]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; indx&amp;amp;,&amp;quot;0x&amp;quot;;&lt;b&gt;HEX$&lt;/b&gt;(psn.highLongOfPSN);
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;PRINT HEX$&lt;/b&gt;(psn.lowLongOfPSN),ProcessName$
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;INC&lt;/b&gt;(indx&amp;amp;)
&lt;b&gt;UNTIL LEN&lt;/b&gt;(ProcessName$) == 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= GLOBALS =

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;GLOBALS &amp;quot;filename1&amp;quot; [,&amp;quot;filename2&amp;quot;...]&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;p&gt;This statement behaves identically as the &lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; statement. The keyword &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLOBALS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;is maintained for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of FutureBasic. To make your program easier to read, you may typically use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLOBALS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to include files which define global variables, constants, record structures, etc., while using the &lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; statement to include functions, etc. However, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLOBALS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement and the &lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; statement are completely interchangeable.

&lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= GOSUB =

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;GOSUB {lineNumber|&amp;quot;statementLabel&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Executes the subroutine located at the indicated line number or statement label. The subroutine should include a &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statement; &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; causes execution to continue at the statement following the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an outdated method for executing routines; it's generally a better idea to encapsulate your routines in a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; function. However, there are a couple of possible advantages to using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Routines called using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may execute somewhat faster than local functions.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can create a &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; subroutine inside a local function, and use a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; within that local function to call the subroutine. The variables used in the subroutine will have the same scope as the local function. This may be a good way to execute certain repetitive tasks within the local function.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;Subroutines can be executed in a &amp;quot;nested&amp;quot; fashion; i.e., one subroutine may call another. FB keeps track of where each &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statement should &amp;quot;return&amp;quot; to.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;First line.&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;sub1&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Fifth line.&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;sub1&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Second line.&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;sub2&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Fourth line.&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;RETURN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;sub2&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Third line.&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;RETURN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

program output:
&lt;code&gt;First line.
Second line.
Third line.
Fourth line.
Fifth line.&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
It is possible for a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement inside a local function to jump to a subroutine located outside of that function; it's also possible for a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; to jump to a subroutine located inside a local function. However, this kind of programming is not recommended, because the resulting switches in variable scope can produce unexpected results.

&lt;code&gt; RETURN FN; LOCAL FN &lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= GOTO=

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;GOTO {lineNumber|&amp;quot;statementLabel&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;p&gt;Causes program execution to continue at the statement at the indicated line number or statement label. The target statement must be within the same &amp;quot;scope&amp;quot; as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;statement (i.e., they must both be within the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; part of the program, or they must both be within the same local function). Also, you should never use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to jump into the middle of any &amp;quot;block&amp;quot; statement structures (such as &lt;code&gt;FOR...NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SELECT...END SELECT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LONG IF...END IF&lt;/code&gt;, etc.).

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is sometimes useful in the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; part of the program, to branch around certain structures such as &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/code&gt; procedures. However, excessive use of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain. The use of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is generally discouraged; FutureBasic's other branching and looping structures offer a better solution.

&lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN; GOSUB; FOR; LONG IF; SELECT; ENTERPROC&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revised:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
November; 2006 (FB 4, Release 4)

=== Description ===
The &lt;em&gt;CFIndex&lt;/em&gt; include file is a replacement of the standard set of instructions used to implement all &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; commands. By including this file, your application instantly takes on the new features, even if you have already programmed things using the old &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;CFIndex&lt;/em&gt; offers several advantages:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased speed.
&lt;li&gt;Easier localization through the use of CF strings instead of Pascal strings.
&lt;li&gt;Improved memory handling.
&lt;li&gt;Sorting (See &lt;code&gt;FN CFINDEXSORT&lt;/code&gt;.)
&lt;/ul&gt;
Once you have added the file to your project, either by using the Include command or by dragging and dropping the file into your project window, you may use standard &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; commands to transparently take advantage of the new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;INDEX$&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;cfindexsort.html&quot;&gt;CFINDEXSORT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== CFINDEXSORT == 
 

=== Function === 
 ✔ χ Appearance ✔ χ Standard ✔ χ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;ignore&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;FN CFINDEXSORT &lt;/b&gt; ( &lt;i&gt;whichIndex&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revised:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
November; 2006 (FB 4, Release 4)

=== Description ===
This function is actually easier to implement than it appears. The return value of the function is undefined and therefore ignored. The parameter that you pass to the array is the index number. Pass zero if you are only using one &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array.
&lt;br&gt;
Items in the array are sorted from the least to the greatest.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This only works if you have included the &lt;em&gt;CFIndex.Incl&lt;/em&gt;. This only works in CarbonLib v1.0 and later and in MacÊOSÊX v10.0 and later. If you have any expectation of serving older computers, you should block the function so that this sorting routine is not executed.

&lt;strong&gt;To allocate, increase or decrease memory for &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; arrays:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;i&gt;bytes&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;[,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;indexID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;i&gt;numElements&amp;amp;, indexID, eltSize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

To release the memory used by existing &lt;code&gt;INDEX&lt;/code&gt; arrays:&lt;br&gt;
3. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR INDEX$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;indexID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Use syntax (1) or (2) to allocate memory for an &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; string array, and to specify whether the array shall consist of fixed-length or variable-length cells for the strings. Using fixed-length cells provides greater speed but may require more memory. Using variable-length cells provides more efficient use of memory, but processing may be slower. You must use Syntax (1) or (2) to allocate memory for an &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array before the array will function.

Use Syntax (1) to specify the total number of bytes to be allocated for a variable-cell-length &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;indexID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter indicates which of the ten available &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; arrays (numbered 0 through 9) to allocate space for. If you omit this parameter, space will be allocated for &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array #0.

Use Syntax (2) to specify the number of elements to be allocated for a fixed-cell-length &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;eltSize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter should be in the range (1..256); it fixes the size of the cells. You can store a string of up to (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;eltSize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; - 1&lt;/code&gt;) characters in such a cell. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;indexID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter indicates which &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array (0 - 9) to allocate space for.

You can also use Syntax (1) or (2) to increase or decrease the amount of memory allocated for an existing array. This is sometimes useful if you find you need more (or less) memory than you originally allocated. If you increase the memory allocation, none of the existing strings in the array will be affected. If you want to decrease the memory allocation without affecting the existing strings, make sure you don't specify too small a number; you can use the &lt;code&gt;MEM&lt;/code&gt; function to determine how much memory the existing strings occupy.

Use Syntax (3) or (4) to release the memory previously allocated for one or more &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; arrays. Syntax (3) releases the memory occupied by all existing &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; arrays. Syntax (4) empties each string in an &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array without releasing memory occupied by the array. If you omit the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;indexID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter, then &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array #0 is used.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h1&gt; CLEAR LPRINT &lt;/h1&gt;


== CLEAR LPRINT == 
 
=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
November, 2006 (FB 4, Revision 4)


&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
If output has been routed to the printer, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; forces the Printing Manager to print the current page, without closing the print job. The other ways to print the current page are to execute &lt;code&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; or to exit the program, both of which also cause the print job to be closed.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Notes ===

Before using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/code&gt;, you must route printing to the screen. Closing the printer while output is pointing to the printed page is the equivalent to cutting off a limb while you are sitting on it. The following fragment shows how this might be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ROUTE&lt;/b&gt; _toScreen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CLEAR LPRINT&lt;br&gt;
ROUTE&lt;/b&gt; _toPrinter
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Example ===
NEEDS IMG!!! &lt;img src=&quot;res/cd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;19&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;CD Example: Printer.BAS&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

Cutting is one of the most basic kitchen preparation skills. By far the most common utensil for this is a [[w:Chef's knife|chef's knife]], although a paring knife and others are also used. With practice, cutting food can be safe, fun, and easy, and is a skill that is well worth developing for anyone who prepares food.

== Maintenance ==
;Sharpening: Knives should always be kept sharp – cuts occur more frequently with dull knives because they have a tendency to slip off the food being cut, rather than biting in. Use a honing steel to straighten the edge before each cutting session, and sharpen the blade by grinding a new edge when necessary, typically every few months or years, depending on use.
;Storage: Knives should be stored separately from other utensils, either in a knife block, a knife tray, or with a knife guard.
* Never leave knives in a sink full of soapy water.
* Never try to catch a falling knife.

;Mechanical slicers:
* Never try to clean the circular blade of a mechanical slicer while the machine is still assembled.
* ''Always ensure that mechanical slicers and other electrical cutting equipment are disconnected from the power supply before disassembling them for cleaning''.

== Use ==
[[Image:Knife Grip.JPG|rigjt|thumb|220px|Holding a chef's knife.]]
=== Knife grip ===
Holding a knife:

When slicing food by hand, always grip the handle of the knife firmly – a loose grip can lead to accidents.

*'''The Grip''': The correct grip gives one the maximum degree of control over the knife. It increases one's accuracy and speed, as well as preventing slipping which can cause accidents. The type of grip one uses depends to some extent on the task being performed, as well as the size of the knife. The grip most frequently used for general cutting and slicing is the one illustrated. Grasp the handle in the palm of the hand with the thumb on one side of the blade, the forefinger on the other side, and the middle, ring and small fingers wrapped around the handle.  This is believed by many food-service professionals to give maximum control.

=== Food grip ===
The food item is held firmly with the other hand, the '''fingers curled under,''' so that the side of the blade is against the ''knuckles.'' The curling under of the hand holding the food is extremely important and a safety requirement that must never be disregarded even when the knife is nowhere near ones fingers so as to make it a habit that becomes automatic. Many accidents, and indeed the loss of digits, could have been avoided if this technique were always followed. Regrettably, even professionals sometimes disregard their own rules. ''Resist the temptation to do so''.

=== Other ===
* When using a mandoline, use the food holder which is supplied with it. If it didn't have one when you bought it, it is quite likely being illegally sold in your jurisdiction which probably requires that they be sold with a holder included.

*When passing a knife to another do so handle first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;% This is a sample LaTeX input file.  (Version of 12 August 2004.)
%
% A '%' character causes TeX to ignore all remaining text on the line,
% and is used for comments like this one.

\documentclass{article}      % Specifies the document class

                             % The preamble begins here.
\title{An Example Document}  % Declares the document's title.
\author{Leslie Lamport}      % Declares the author's name.
\date{January 21, 1994}      % Deleting this command produces today's date.

\newcommand{\ip}[2]{(#1, #2)}
                             % Defines \ip{arg1}{arg2} to mean
                             % (arg1, arg2).

%\newcommand{\ip}[2]{\langle #1 | #2\rangle}
                             % This is an alternative definition of
                             % \ip that is commented out.

\begin{document}             % End of preamble and beginning of text.

\maketitle                   % Produces the title.

This is an example input file.  Comparing it with
the output it generates can show you how to
produce a simple document of your own.

\section{Ordinary Text}      % Produces section heading.  Lower-level
                             % sections are begun with similar 
                             % \subsection and \subsubsection commands.

The ends  of words and sentences are marked 
  by   spaces. It  doesn't matter how many 
spaces    you type; one is as good as 100.  The
end of   a line counts as a space.

One   or more   blank lines denote the  end 
of  a paragraph.  

Since any number of consecutive spaces are treated
like a single one, the formatting of the input
file makes no difference to
      \LaTeX,                % The \LaTeX command generates the LaTeX logo.
but it makes a difference to you.  When you use
\LaTeX, making your input file as easy to read 
as possible will be a great help as you write 
your document and when you change it.  This sample 
file shows how you can add comments to your own input 
file.

Because printing is different from typewriting,
there are a number of things that you have to do
differently when preparing an input file than if
you were just typing the document directly.
Quotation marks like
       ``this'' 
have to be handled specially, as do quotes within
quotes:
       ``\,`this'            % \, separates the double and single quote.
        is what I just 
        wrote, not  `that'\,''.  

Dashes come in three sizes: an 
       intra-word 
dash, a medium dash for number ranges like 
       1--2, 
and a punctuation 
       dash---like 
this.

A sentence-ending space should be larger than the
space between words within a sentence.  You
sometimes have to type special commands in
conjunction with punctuation characters to get
this right, as in the following sentence.
       Gnats, gnus, etc.\ all  % `\ ' makes an inter-word space.
       begin with G\@.         % \@ marks end-of-sentence punctuation.
You should check the spaces after periods when
reading your output to make sure you haven't
forgotten any special cases.  Generating an
ellipsis
       \ldots\               % `\ ' is needed after `\ldots' because TeX 
                             % ignores spaces after command names like \ldots 
                             % made from \ + letters.
                             %
                             % Note how a `%' character causes TeX to ignore 
                             % the end of the input line, so these blank lines 
                             % do not start a new paragraph.
                             %
with the right spacing around the periods requires
a special command.

\LaTeX\ interprets some common characters as
commands, so you must type special commands to
generate them.  These characters include the
following:
       \$ \&amp; \% \# \{ and \}.

In printing, text is usually emphasized with an
       \emph{italic}  
type style.  

\begin{em}
   A long segment of text can also be emphasized 
   in this way.  Text within such a segment can be 
   given \emph{additional} emphasis.
\end{em}

It is sometimes necessary to prevent \LaTeX\ from
breaking a line where it might otherwise do so.
This may be at a space, as between the ``Mr.''\ and
``Jones'' in
       ``Mr.~Jones'',        % ~ produces an unbreakable interword space.
or within a word---especially when the word is a
symbol like
       \mbox{\emph{itemnum}} 
that makes little sense when hyphenated across
lines.

Footnotes\footnote{This is an example of a footnote.}
pose no problem.

\LaTeX\ is good at typesetting mathematical formulas
like
       \( x-3y + z = 7 \) 
or
       \( a_{1} &gt; x^{2n} + y^{2n} &gt; x' \)
or  
       \( \ip{A}{B} = \sum_{i} a_{i} b_{i} \).
The spaces you type in a formula are 
ignored.  Remember that a letter like
       $x$                   % $ ... $  and  \( ... \)  are equivalent
is a formula when it denotes a mathematical
symbol, and it should be typed as one.

\section{Displayed Text}

Text is displayed by indenting it from the left
margin.  Quotations are commonly displayed.  There
are short quotations
\begin{quote}
   This is a short quotation.  It consists of a 
   single paragraph of text.  See how it is formatted.
\end{quote}
and longer ones.
\begin{quotation}
   This is a longer quotation.  It consists of two
   paragraphs of text, neither of which are
   particularly interesting.

   This is the second paragraph of the quotation.  It
   is just as dull as the first paragraph.
\end{quotation}
Another frequently-displayed structure is a list.
The following is an example of an \emph{itemized}
list.
\begin{itemize}
   \item This is the first item of an itemized list.
         Each item in the list is marked with a ``tick''.
         You don't have to worry about what kind of tick
         mark is used.

   \item This is the second item of the list.  It
         contains another list nested inside it.  The inner
         list is an \emph{enumerated} list.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item This is the first item of an enumerated 
                  list that is nested within the itemized list.

            \item This is the second item of the inner list.  
                  \LaTeX\ allows you to nest lists deeper than 
                  you really should.
         \end{enumerate}
         This is the rest of the second item of the outer
         list.  It is no more interesting than any other
         part of the item.
   \item This is the third item of the list.
\end{itemize}
You can even display poetry.
\begin{verse}
   There is an environment 
    for verse \\             % The \\ command separates lines
   Whose features some poets % within a stanza.
   will curse.   

                             % One or more blank lines separate stanzas.

   For instead of making\\
   Them do \emph{all} line breaking, \\
   It allows them to put too many words on a line when they'd rather be 
   forced to be terse.
\end{verse}

Mathematical formulas may also be displayed.  A
displayed formula 
is 
one-line long; multiline
formulas require special formatting instructions.
   \[  \ip{\Gamma}{\psi'} = x'' + y^{2} + z_{i}^{n}\]
Don't start a paragraph with a displayed equation,
nor make one a paragraph by itself.

\end{document}               % End of document.

“Dramatiķim jābūt reizē ir dzejniekam, ir komponistam- mūziķim( operu tekstos), ir gleznotājam( dzīvi iztēlojot notikumu norisināšanās apvidu), ir tēlniekam( atzīmējot darbojošos personu vaibstus, žestus, kustības, kā arī izdomājot fantastiskus tēlus), ir, beidzot, baletmeistaram(operās). Un bez tam viņam vēl jābūt arī dziļam psihologam un filozofam.

To prasīja viņa dzīve, kura gatavoja viņam pārbaudījumu pēc pārbaudījuma, gan jaunībā, gan brieduma gados. M.

Astronomiem pirmo reizi izdevies uztvert gaismu
no planētas, kas riņķo ap kādu tālu zvaigzni.
Šis nozīmīgais atklājums, par kuru novembrī
informēja ``BBC News Online'', detalizēti izklāstīts
trešdien iznākušajā žurnālā ``Nature''.
Izdarot šo atklājumu, Lielbritānijas zinātnieki no Svētā Andreja
Universitātes Skotijā un Centrālās pētniecības laboratorijas izstrādājuši
metodi, ar kuru izdevies uztvert vāju gaismas signālu, kas nāk no planētas,
lai gan zvaigzne, ap kuru šī planēta riņķo, ir 10 000 reižu spožāka par 
planētu. Šo metodi tagad būs iespējams izmantot, lai meklētu citas 
planētas visumā. ``Tas ir milzīgs Lielbritānijas astronomu sasniegums,''
sacīja Elementārdaļiņu fizikas un astronomijas pētniecības padomes 
vadītājs Ians Halidejs.
``Dramatiķim jābūt reizē ir dzejniekam, ir komponistam- mūziķim( operu tekstos), ir gleznotājam( dzīvi iztēlojot notikumu norisināšanās apvidu), ir tēlniekam( atzīmējot darbojošos personu vaibstus, žestus, kustības, kā arī izdomājot fantastiskus tēlus), ir, beidzot, baletmeistaram(operās).

Astronomiem pirmo reizi izdevies uztvert gaismu
no planētas, kas riņķo ap kādu tālu zvaigzni.
Šis nozīmīgais atklājums, par kuru novembrī
informēja ``BBC News Online'', detalizēti izklāstīts
trešdien iznākušajā žurnālā ``Nature''.
Izdarot šo atklājumu, Lielbritānijas zinātnieki no Svētā Andreja
Universitātes Skotijā un Centrālās pētniecības laboratorijas izstrādājuši
metodi, ar kuru izdevies uztvert vāju gaismas signālu, kas nāk no planētas,
lai gan zvaigzne, ap kuru šī planēta riņķo, ir 10 000 reižu spožāka par 
planētu. Šo metodi tagad būs iespējams izmantot, lai meklētu citas 
planētas visumā. ``Tas ir milzīgs Lielbritānijas astronomu sasniegums,''
sacīja Elementārdaļiņu fizikas un astronomijas pētniecības padomes 
vadītājs Ians Halidejs.
``Dramatiķim jābūt reizē ir dzejniekam, ir komponistam- mūziķim( operu tekstos), ir gleznotājam( dzīvi iztēlojot notikumu norisināšanās apvidu), ir tēlniekam( atzīmējot darbojošos personu vaibstus, žestus, kustības, kā arī izdomājot fantastiskus tēlus), ir, beidzot, baletmeistaram(operās). Un bez tam viņam vēl jābūt arī dziļam psihologam un filozofam.
(V. Plūdonis)
Man ļoti patīk un simpatizē Mārtiņa Zīverta daiļrade. Distance un savaldīšanās, kas ir zīmīgi viņa ``portretā''. Ne velti uz rakstnieku var attiecināt, paša radītā tēla, Minauga dēla Repeķa ( lugā ``Vara''), vārdus- ``Mīlēt drīkst, tikai nedrīkst to rādīt''- kā paša uzskatus. To prasīja viņa dzīve, kura gatavoja viņam pārbaudījumu pēc pārbaudījuma, gan jaunībā, gan brieduma gados. M. Zīvertam bijis rūdīts raksturs, piemēram, dodoties uz Romu studēt, lai gan viņam kabatā ir tikai pārdesmit latu, tomēr pasākums lemts neveiksmei. Tas dod viņam dzīves pieredzi, jo dzīvošana svešā pilsētā bez iztikas līdzekļiem un pazīstamiem cilvēkiem, pie kuriem varētu griezties pēc palīdzības, ir ļoti grūti.
“Intelekts, pasaules kultūras līmenis, virtuoza meistarība- to mēs rodam Mārtiņa Zīverta dramaturģijā.'' (L. Dzene)

== Lost pages ==

G'day, you seem to have lost a page... I've moved it, making it a sub-page of your User page if you need to retrieve any text:
* [[User:Trent y/Dislaimer]]
I've also deleted the About This Book page that you started and blanked. To have a page deleted, please place a delete tag at the top - &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - and an admin will come along and delete it at some point.
To make links to sub-pages, you can use some link shortcuts that will make your life easier. See [[Help:Editing#Subpage links]] for more information. I've edited the main page of your book to reflect this, if you'd like to take a look.
You can probably find a good range of images for direct inclusion in your Wikibook by looking on the Wiki [[Commons:|Commons]]. All images on Commons can be used in your wikibook without uploading them to Wikibooks, as if they were local images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Diffraction1.png|right]]
We have already seen why fringes are visible when light passes through multiple slits. However, this does not explain why, when light is only passing through 1 slit, a pattern such as the one on the right is visible on the screen.

The answer to this lies in [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)|phasors]]. We already know that the phasor arrows add up to give a resultant phasor. By considering the phasor arrows from many paths which light takes through a slit, we can explain why light and dark fringes occur.

At the normal line, where the brightest fringe is shown, all the phasor arrows are pointing in the same direction, and so add up to create the greatest amplitude: a bright fringe.

At other fringes, we can use the same formulæ as for diffraction gratings, as we are effectively treating the single slit as a row of beams of light, coming from a row of slits.

Now consider the central beam of light. By trigonometry:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{W}{L}&lt;/math&gt;,

where θ = beam angle (radians), W = beam width and L = distance from slit to screen. Since θ is small, we can approximate sin θ as θ, so:

&lt;math&gt;\theta \approx \frac{W}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

and since λ = d sin θ:

&lt;math&gt;\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==
1. What is the width of the central bright fringe on a screen placed 5m from a single slit, where the slit is 0.01m wide and the wavelength is 500nm?

And that's all there is to it ... maybe.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{W}{L} \approx \frac{\lambda}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{W}{5} \approx \frac{500 \times 10^{-9}}{0.01}&lt;/math&gt;

W = 250μm, but since this is only half the beam, the beam is 500μm wide.

*Italicise all occurrences of spell incantations but ''not'' their other names, especially at the title of templates on spell pages and on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic#Spells|Magic]] page. (e.g. &lt;/font&gt;''Avada Kedavra'' is the Killing Curse&lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;) 
*Write all occurrences of book names in full and italicise them. (e.g. &lt;/font&gt;''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''&lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;)

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0em; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: none; background-color: #FFCCCC; border: 2px solid #FF9999&quot;&gt;

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

&lt;big style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
This book chapter should be viewed as an introductory text on the making of Wiki templates, and an overview of what templates ''do'' is provided in this first section.   First lets get some basic terminology:  
 
*'''''TEMPLATES are just blocks of saved text that have been given names'''''.   Some are ordinary text paragraphs and some contain wikitext to make headings, indents, tables, and the like.   In a simple case, by typing a template's name in the work, an entire block of text is added to the page with all of its formats and other parts, just as if it had been typed by the user.   This behavior can be repeated at any point that the user wants, and almost any work that is found on a wiki page could be placed within a template to do this.  The main effort as you might suppose, lies in its initial design.

*'''''NAMES of templates are assigned when they are first saved'''''. The '''name''' must be unique, and it is used when a template is ''called'' for use.   Sometimes other text is also used along with the name; it can include any '''options''' and '''parameters'''.       

*'''''OPTIONS allow the user to vary the template's usual behavior.'''''.   The usual behavior  suits most situations but the designer builds-in ways of changing things just in case.  Option values are usually limited to a short list so these are described in a template's documentation.  For example, option values for an option called ''align'' might include only ''left'', ''right'', or ''center'', and no others.   Templates do not ''always'' need options, since their default behavior is often enough. 

*'''''DEFAULTS are the values used by a template when the user did not say'''''.   Default values are specified in design, and they could apply to formats or to user text inputs.   For example, in the alignment example above, if the ''align'' option was not used, the template could  use ''left'', provided that ''left'' had been specified in design as its default.   In the same way if the user forgets to type a text input, the template could use a pre-planned ''default'' input instead of the missing parameter; sometimes just a code to say something was forgotten.   

*'''''PARAMETERS are usually bits of text that a user enters for a template to process'''''.   For example, if a template makes text red, it still needs to know the text to color; this text is called a ''parameter'', and the text is included by the user when the template is ''called'' for use.   Sometimes parameters contain text like code to insert an image, or even a gallery or a table; it just depends what the template is designed for.   A template can even be the parameter of ''another'' template; for example, a template to insert a test paragraph might occupy the parameter space of a template to make a text box.   The new paragraph would then appear in a new text box. 

*'''''MORE GENERALLY,''''' templates let us do much of the preparation in advance of making a page, and let us insert a block of typing, be it code to make tables, boxes, and other structures, or just a paragraph of text that is used a lot.  The remainder of this introduction gives a  few examples to ''show'' what templates do on the page, and in the sections that follow will be found what is needed to modify and make new templates for use in writing Wikibooks.

&lt;big&gt;'''In the first example'''&lt;/big&gt;, the template '''Caption''' is used.   It has two text parameters and no options at all.

This is the code to call the template for use;
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{caption|This is the first parameter's text: | This is the second parameter's text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
The result of doing so is to produce the text:
{{result|fs=1em|{{caption|This is the first parameter's text: | This is the second parameter's text}}}}
Notice that the template has formatted the text, and that each parameter was handled differently.   This template is used to make consistently formatted image captions.   The source code for the template ''Caption'' features little more than text formatting.

&lt;big&gt;'''In the second example'''&lt;/big&gt;, the template '''Drop''' is used.   It has one text parameter and several options, none of which are needed here.

This is the code to call the template for use;
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{drop|N}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;otice that the template has inserted...}}
The result of doing so can be seen in the paragraph below.

{{drop|N}}otice that the template has inserted a drop capital from the single character used as a parameter.   This template can be used to start sections within certain body text.   Again, the source code for the template ''Drop'' is largely text formatting.


&lt;big&gt;'''The third example'''&lt;/big&gt; uses template '''Dropimage''' to make a drop-box with an image in it.   This template has many options, but only two were needed; the ''width'' option, and the ''align'' option.   The other options use the defaults.   There are two parameters; the top caption ''Press to View'' and the contents, in this case the Wikitext code for an image.   The contents in the example can be viewed by clicking the arrow on the box. 

This is the code to call the template;
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dropimage|width=150px|align=center|Press to View|[[image:Flower poster.jpg|600px]]&lt;br&gt;A Flower Poster}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
The result of doing so is:
{{dropimage|width=300px|align=center|Press to View|[[image:Flower poster.jpg|600px]]&lt;br&gt;A Flower Poster}} 
{{-}}
The template for this example consists of code to build the box structure, and the image code is strictly its parameter, i.e., the item that it processes. 

Whereas the ''detailed'' study of this subject is complex, it should become clear that using and making templates like those mentioned above is well within the abilities of most wiki writers.   Sadly, it is often the case that a writer sees the advantages of templates only when his work is nearly done, and a bit of effort in recognizing repetitive routine early in the work could save much time.  Whenever a routine is repeated often, there is a job for a template.

It is true to say that most templates in the wiki family of projects consist of either the formatting of text paragraphs or the making of boxes of some kind.   With this in mind the text below explains the process of template-making for text, boxes, and drop-controls. As preparation, those who intend to make box templates of any kind would benefit from an elementary knowledge of tables, and this knowledge is quickly available in the first few sections of the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|'''Tables''']], where an introduction to CSS styles is also to be had.

==Finding and Using Templates==
There are already several thousands of templates within the WikiBooks templates namespace.   That is another way of saying that the templates list is already long.   At first sight, this may seem to avoid the need for template-making, but things are not so simple.

If the ''name'' of the template is known, then it can be found easily, but if the name is ''not'' known, it can take a long time to find a template similar to the one that you are looking for.   Templates have their functions described on their own pages but many do not include notes, so the task of knowing which is which, and what they do even when they are found, becomes doubly difficult.

Templates made in ''Wikipedia''  and ''Wikibooks'' are not interchangeable, since they exist on separate servers.   Although the code to make them is identical, this description applies to finding things in Wikibooks.     

*To view lists of templates listed ''alphabetically'' within WikiBooks, follow the link to the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AllPages&amp;namespace=10 '''All Templates Namespace'''].
*To find templates listed in various template ''categories'', for example, ''drop-control templates'', follow the link to the page [[:Category:Templates]].
*If you ''know'' a template's name, then find the template page by using the search box on any Wiki page.  For example, to find ''Dropimage'' just type;
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;Template:Dropimage&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
then ''enter''.

When a template page is found, the code to make the template can be seen by viewing its editing window.  Many pages have their documentation on the same page as the template code, isolated from it with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.

If after searching, you still need to make a template, as many no doubt do, then read on.


===Put it on the Page===
----
Templates are called for use in pages by typing a line of Wikitext, and so the user needs to know the correct spelling of the template's name, options, and parameters.   Even when these are known it is all too easy to disrupt a page with a template error, especially during trials, so consider using the [[WB:SB|'''sandbox''']] for testing.   Some templates have all of the documentation and details on the same page and this makes them easy to use.   See templates  [[Template:Plainlist|Plainlist]], and  [[Template:Codebits|Codebits]] as examples.

To ''call up'' any template for use in a page, '''the code is typed within double curly brackets'''. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.     
Included within the curly brackets is the template '''name''', then, if required, a sequence of '''options''', followed by a sequence of '''parameters'''.   '''All entries are separated by ''pipe'' symbols'''. ('''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''').   For example, the general form to use for a template with two ''options'' and one ''parameter'' is as follows:
{{-}}
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Name|Option1=Value|Option2=value|Parameter1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
{{-}}
and a typical example of its use is:
{{-}}
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Plainlist|width=250px|background=LightSalmon|The text for the box goes here.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}            
{{-}}
The above code has only ''one'' parameter; it is numbered '''1''' by default.  Parameters are given numbers or names to identify them in their design code, and examples will be seen in the sections that follow.  The template-call in the example uses a so-called ''unnamed'' parameter, because it is not preceded by a term like '''1=''' (numbered parameter),  or '''content=''' (typical named parameter).        When templates have ''several'' parameters then the parameter numbers or names help to make clear to the template which is which.   Alternatively, the template can manage with unnamed and unnumbered parameter entries provided that they are in any case listed in their correct number sequence.   When in doubt, use names or numbers.   At times, especially when the first character of a parameter is a symbol, the use of named or numbered parameters avoids the corruption that would otherwise result with the unnamed entry.

'''The sequence of &lt;u&gt;''options''&lt;/u&gt; is ''unimportant''''', since '''all options must be named''' in any case.   Using ''named'' values just means adding the name of the option and an equals sign before the option's ''value''.   This of course requires a knowledge of the template's details.

'''''Template'' names are sensitive to case except for the first letter''', so a useful convention is to use lower case for template name, parameters, and options all of the time; that way you will never be in doubt.

'''''Parameter'' names are quite sensitive to case in every way''', so a capital letter makes all the difference.   As a general rule, do not mix ''unnamed'' and ''named'' parameters in a template call, since the method used by the program to interpret their meaning becomes confused.   Either use ''all unnamed'' with special attention to their sequence, or ''all named'' in any order that you like.

===Find Details from Code===
----
Let us assume that a template made by others has been found but that its details are unclear.   Even without much knowledge of mark-up, it is usually possible to discern the options and parameters of a template by inspection of its coding.   To see how this can be done follow the reasoning below.

The coding and anything else on a template page can be displayed in the sandbox by typing a special code there.   The template does not do anything when this is done; it just reveals the text of the template page.   That is, it reveals the coding and any documentation.   As an example the template code for say, the template '''Tocbox''', can be viewed in the Sandbox by typing: 
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{msgnw:tocbox}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
To save the reader the trouble of doing so here, the template code for '''Tocbox''' is given below.
{{-}}

'''Code for the Template Tocbox'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding=20px style=&quot;font-family:courier;border:1px dashed blue;background:#f9f9f9;;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td align=left&gt;&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| class=toccolours style=&quot;margin:1em 0 0 0;width:{{{width|300px}}};&quot; align={{{align|left}}} 
| align=center style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;|{{{Heading|{{{1}}}}}}
|-
| align=left style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;|{{{Content|{{{2}}}}}}
|}
&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

{{-}}
The template page itself has a good description for its use, but assume for a moment that the descriptive material was absent.   The code at the top of a template page is ''always'' the template source code; consider the example given above.   Although it looks complicated, the object here is ''not'' to understand it, but to find the options and parameters from the code itself.

Note that the end of the code is marked with a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, to make sure that any text that follows it is not used as a part of the template.   In this example, there are ''two'' parameters; they can be recognized as the items with the form:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{heading|{{{1}}}}}}  and  {{{content|{{{2}}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

These entries identify '''parameters''' ''one'' and ''two'' respectively.   It is clear, even without much understanding, that the first parameter is the ''heading'' text and the second parameter is the ''content'' text, and these terms in addition to the numbers could be used as their names .   In the event that a user forgets to enter the parameter for say, ''content'', a '''{{{2}}}''' will be displayed on the page as a reminder of what is missing.

All of the '''options''' within this template are recognized from the typical form;

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{align|left}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

This extract states that there is an option called ''align'' that has the default value of ''left''.  The idea of this default is that the value '''left''' would be used for ''align'' if the user does not use that option in the template call. The option could have almost ''any'' name; in fact it has been given the same name as the '''HTML attribute''' associated with it, (the part before the equals sign in the main code block).   There are several properties within this code but only two of them have been coded as options; ''align'' and ''width'', and both options have similar bracket formats to that of the above example.

With the options and parameters now understood, test the template on a page as follows:

This is the code:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tocbox|align=center|width=300px|Heading text|Content paragraphs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
The result is:
{{tocbox|align=center|width=300px|Heading text|Content paragraphs}} 

It should by now be clear that despite having no specification for the template in the first instance, it has been possible to obtain information from the coding for its use.



===Modifying a Template=== 
----
Assume for a moment that a template has been found that is ''nearly'' right, but not quite.   Say for example that the background color was the only part that was wrong.   The source code for such a template could be changed, by adding a term to modify its background color.   Then, the ''modified'' version could be saved as a new template, with a different name.   Note that if the modified template were saved with the ''same'' name as before, the existing users who depended on the original colors would experience unwelcome changes in their work.

There is another way that allows the new user to choose colors while the existing users can continue to enjoy the default colors that their work displays.   The template can keep the old name if the background property is made into an option, and the original background color made its default.   Then, since the old users would not bother to specify the background color, perhaps not even knowing that they now ''could'', they would get the usual color as the default value and would be happy with it.   The new users who need a ''different'' color, could simply specify it as an option value when they call the template for use.   In this way both parties would be content.

The modifying of a template approaches the difficulty of ''making'' a new one at times, and this process is covered in other sections below.   For the background-change case, a suitable '''modified Tocbox''' code module would look like this.
The code is:
&lt;table cellpadding=20px style=&quot;font-family:courier;border:1px dashed blue;background:#f9f9f9;;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td align=left&gt;&lt;center&gt;Code for a Modified Template Tocbox&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| class=toccolours style=&quot;margin:1em 0 0 0;width:{{{width|300px}}};background:{{{background|#f9f9f9;}}};&quot; align={{{align|left}}} 
| align=center style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;|{{{Heading|{{{1}}}}}}
|-
| align=left style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;|{{{Content|{{{2}}}}}}
|}
&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
{{-}}
In the above code the ''background'' property has been made into an option.   In addition, the original background color, '''#f9f9f9;''' , (light gray), has been used for the default.   To labor the point, if the user does not bother to specify the background color, he will still get the ''gray'' color as before.   Note again that the added option need not have been called ''background'' but could, for example, have been called ''bgc'' or some other name.   In that event the template's option code would look like '''&lt;nowiki&gt;background:{{{bgc|#f9f9f9;}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', and another color would then be called using say, '''&lt;nowiki&gt;bcg=papayawhip&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' on the page.  

The real template '''Tocbox''' has not been modified here, though this example provides a reliable demonstration of the method to use for doing so.   After the modification above the template could be called by the new users as follows:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tocbox|align=center|width=250px|background=papayawhip|Heading|Long text paragraphs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

A knowledge of CSS property values allows considerable variation in a template's appearance.   Luckily, the subject is well documented.   See the external ''W3'' site's [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp '''CSS Reference List'''] for a comprehensive listing of values and properties.   Although the examples on the referenced page are designed for style sheets, the syntax found there is also that used for modifying styles within templates and other in-line styles.   In addition, a useful color reference can also be had at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors '''Web Colors'''].  A drop-box with many of the CSS properties for tables has been provided in the box-making section below. If time is short it could be noted that most of the template work done so far in this project, (WikiBooks that is), could have made do with little more that the CSS properties of text and tables.     Study of these two areas is thus rewarding.

CSS reference sources are useful, though styles can also be changed with ''HTML attributes'', (the styles like ''align'' with the ''equals'' signs).   Such attributes can be seen in HTML reference texts as opposed to CSS texts, and in the aforementioned drop-box below.   It may be of interest to know that some HTML attributes are the only ways to accomplish certain tasks;   examples include ''colspan'' (to span table columns), ''rowspan'' (to span table rows), and ''align'', (to align tables to center, something that the CSS ''float'' property cannot do).



==Making Templates==
There are many template types, but those used for inserting and modifying text are the most numerous.   Boxes feature next; whether they are ''information boxes'', so-called ''user boxes'', or simple ''text boxes'', they all have common constructs.   Some templates have dynamic functions, like drop-controls, though once their basic outlines are clear, they can be shaped for many purposes.   At least one example of each will be considered.

Template making consists of writing functional code, Wikitext or HTML, or sometimes a mixture of both.   The method is to test the code in the Sandbox, until the function works well.   Then the options and the parameters can be assigned to the code.   These are tested again, and if all is well, the block of code can be saved as a template.

In saving the template it as well to check whether or not there is an existing template of that name already.   The simplest way to save a template is as follows.   First, make sure that you are logged-on in a page of '''WikiBooks''', to avoid making a template in the wrong project.   Go to the ''search'' box at the left of the WikiBooks page, and enter the wording to find the as-yet unmade template.   Assume here that the intended name is to be '''Caption'''.   The line to type in the search window is just:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;Template:Caption&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

If the template is found, then the name is already taken, and another is needed.   Assuming that the name is not found, then the search results window will state that it was not found and ask whether or not you want to ''make'' the page.   Click the link to make the page.

The link opens a template editing page with the name of the template already listed as its address.   Copy the code from your work in the sandbox, then paste it into the empty template page.   In the line immediately following the last line in the code block, add the tags '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.   All text not intended to be a part of the template code, must be placed ''between'' these tags, as is the case for the template's description.

Finally, save the page by pressing the ''Save page'' button at the bottom of the page.   The template is now made, and can be called into use with its given name.   Go to the sandbox and test the features of the template.  



===Text Paragraphs===
The code for a template need not start with any special character or symbol.   The main consideration is that the code performs the required action, just as if it were typed directly onto the page.   At the 'end of the code block, be sure to add the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags as mentioned above.

All of the existing Wikitext and HTML code that can be used in a page can be used for a text template.   The user of a page does not have access to the parts associated with styles, namely the heading of the web page and their style sheets.   As a result, users are limited to modifying the parts of the page that ''are'' available, the text within the body of the page.  Those familiar with web page design will know that the only remaining available method is to modify the page's text with '''in-line styles'''.   Working methods use the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags and the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags, thanks to a feature of Wikitext that allows the use of HTML coding within it.   CSS, (Cascading Style Sheet), properties and values are used within these tags to modify the text styles that would otherwise apply.

It is as well to point out here the difference in use for '''&lt;nowiki&gt;span&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;div&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' in text templates.   '''&lt;nowiki&gt;Span&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' should be used to format text only, noting that any formats applied to the text will not extend beyond the last text character; '''&lt;nowiki&gt;div&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', on the other hand, will apply its formats to a rectangular block of text that extends across the page.   the significance of this is that '''&lt;nowiki&gt;div&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' is neater for changing background colors on the page.  A comparative example can be seen in the ''Classes and Styles in Tags'' section of [[Editing_Wikitext/Class_and_Style_Notes|'''Class and Style Notes''']].  


====The Simplest Case====
Before doing any formatting, consider the method for making a template from a simple block of text.   Type a block of text, with all of its formats and page layout in place, then save the block as a template.  It is as simple as that.   Such blocks of text find use for test text, such as [[Template:Lorem_ipsum|'''Lorem Ipsum''']], a well-known text block of fictitious content used by printers and others in laying out their work.   To use such a template just type:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{lorem ipsum}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
at any convenient place on a page to produce the text block.   This block of text is not pre formatted with hard breaks, so it will ''wrap'' within the space where it is typed, and with the ''default'' text styles of the page.    


====Adding Styles====
To ''modify'' text styles, for example, for the text '''This is the text''', we first place the text within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, like this:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Then we construct a style statement ''within'' the first tag.   This example makes the font ''Garamond'', 20 points, colored red.   It looks like this:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond;font-size:20pt;color:red&quot;&gt;This is the text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  
and the result will be:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond;font-size:20pt;color:red&quot;&gt;This is the text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;   
{{-}}
Notice that there is still a closing arrow for the first tag; it is located at the end of the style statement.

Notice also that there are three style rules in the statement, separated by semi-colons; these are ''font-family:Garamond'' to set the ''face'' of the font, ''font-size:20pt'' to set the ''size'' of the font, and ''color:red'' to set the ''color'' of the text.

The style statement starts with the term ''style='', and the right hand side of the statement is entirely within double quotes.

The individual style rules consist of a ''property''; the left part, and a ''value''; the right part.   The two parts are ''separated'' by a full colon.   The format of a style statement is strict.   If the format has an error within it then the whole statement could fail.   Note that Wikitext ''could'' have been used on the text itself; for example, to produce italics, (double quotes), or text that is bold, (triple quotes).   Wikitext acts in ''addition'' to the CSS styles, provided that there are no obvious conflicts.   Several spans and style statements can be applied to produce quite complex results. 

These tag sets can be ''nested''; that is, one set of tags within another set.   Beware of nested '''span''' tags, since there can be unexpected results.   Say that an overall style is applied to several paragraphs using span tags.   Within these paragraphs ''another'' span set is used to format one of the paragraphs differently.   When this is viewed, at the point where the ''inside'' span closes, the styles will have reverted to the body text styles described by the style sheet, and not the intended outside style definition.   This is perhaps because the first closing tag was wrongly interpreted as the end tag.   The problem is '''avoided by using div tags for both''', or at most by '''using span tags for only one of the formats'''.    

Many properties exist to modify text.   They consist of all of the text styles found in style sheets, namely those for fonts, padding, alignment, margins, borders, text colors, and backgrounds. [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp '''CSS property lists''']  and other material on [[CSS_Programming/Fonts_and_Text|'''Fonts and Text''']] provide the source material for all such work.   Although CSS properties and examples are listed primarily for style sheets, the properties and values ''themselves'' can be used on the page and in templates.   The Study Work drop-box contains a useful code module for studying text properties.   It contains most of the useful text entries and can be copied for study into the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Sandbox&amp;action=edit '''sandbox'''].     
{{-}}
{{dropimage|align=center|cbgc=lightyellow|hbgc=lightyellow|Study Work|&lt;b&gt;This module contains most of the useful text properties.   Copy it into the sandbox to experiment with text property values.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:lucida handwriting;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;color:blue;background:papayawhip;word-spacing:0pt;letter-spacing:0pt;line-height:1.8em;border:1px solid red;margin:10pt 100pt 10pt 50pt;padding:10pt 20pt 15pt 20pt;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Text Property Notes&lt;/center&gt;

Both PADDING and MARGIN style-rule values use the sequence TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, then LEFT, i.e. clockwise starting at the top.

BORDER uses the sequence BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-STYLE, then BORDER-COLOR for all of the four borders at once.   Other properties can address the four separately.

PADDING is the space around the text.   MARGIN is the space around the text block.   BORDER is the line that surrounds the text and its padding.

The code block contains the common text properties.

Experiment with the settings. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{-}}


====Parameters====
Now, continue to make use of the ''red-text'' example.  Although the code could be saved as a template just as it is, it would not be very useful since it consists only of fixed text.   To introduce the notion of ''variable text chosen by the user'', we need to make the text position in the code into a ''parameter''.   

Assuming that the basic code works correctly, the ''parameter'' brackets can be added.   In the above text example there is only ''one'' parameter, the content to be formatted.  Starting with the code above, just replace the text part so that the code line now looks like this:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond;font-size:20pt;color:red&quot;&gt;{{{content|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
Notice that the original text has now been replaced with:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{content|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
The ''digit'' identifies the parameter as number one.   It is also the ''name'' of the parameter.   The word ''content'' is just a convenient label, though either the number or the label can be used for ''named parameters''.  If the user forgets to write any text in a parameter position, then the number of the parameter will appear on the page to remind of it.   If the template had ''more'' than one parameter, a similar process could be applied, with a sequence of digits 2,3,4 etc., and adding a suitable label in place of ''content'' for each.

Saving it in the usual way completes such a template. Assuming that the template were to be saved with the name ''BigText'' then the entry to call it for use would be just:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BigText|1=This is the text to format}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note that when a template has ''several'' parameters, the ones used can either be entered as ''named parameters'', using the number or label with an equals sign, or as ''unnamed parameters'', by omitting the added names and just entering the text directly.   The parameters should be ''all unnamed'' or ''all named'' but not a mixture of the two.   If they are ''unnamed'', the correct sequence must be maintained, and if they are ''named'', then ''any'' sequence can be used. Number names and label names ''can'' be mixed without difficulty in a template call.

Although virtually ''any'' tags can be modified by adding a style statement to the leading tag, it is not to say that the work can always be made into a template.   There is at least one exception that exists when it comes to making such a template.   The '''&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;''' tags by their very definition cause a template's parameter code to be disregarded, and a different approach is needed. Instead of attempting to make a modified pre-formatted text template consider the use of [[Template:Prettypre|Prettypre]] for a ready-made fancy version of these tags.   

That is to say, it is possible to modify the '''&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;''' tags with inline styles, to make more interesting pre-formatted text, and it is possible to add the tags to text used as a template's parameter, but making a template from text ''bounded'' by pre-formatting tags will prove more difficult.


====Options====
For completeness, we can also add ''options'' to our basic ''red-text'' template example.   Say we want to change the color of the text from time to time in our work.   We could make another complete template for the new color or we could just add an option to the text coloring code.   The new code looks like this:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond;font-size:20pt;color:{{{tint|red}}}&quot;&gt;{{{content|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 

Note that the entire property value (applies also to an attribute value), must be enclosed in triple curly brackets.   Additionally, the value should be replaced with an ''option name / default value'' combination. In this case, if the user does not specify the color of text, it will be ''red'' in any case.   If it is specified, (see the example below}, it can be changed to any color using the option ''tint='' within the template call.  Assuming that this template's name were ''BigText'' the template call for purple text would be, say:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BigText|tint=purple|1=My purple text goes here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}         

Other options could be made in the same way, and similar techniques could be used regardless of the tags used for the template.

A knowledge of the different tags and access to lists of CSS properties allows considerable scope in template design.



===Making Boxes===
----
The following sections ''make'' box or table templates from Wikitext.   They can also be made with HTML tables in the same way.    When it comes to ''making'' such a template, wikitext is fine but when a table is needed to go ''into'' a template as its parameter, or part of its parameter, an HTML table should be used instead.   The WikiBooks text [[../Tables|'''Making Tables''']] touches on HTML table structures, and explains how to use styles.   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with these concepts in the text that follows.

     
====The Box Structure====
Boxes are essentially ''tables'', in fact table cells.   The CSS property list to format  tables is extensive.  Simple boxes make use of the table ''container'', and one or two ''cells'' within it.

Apart from the table container, the other structures of a table include its ''rows'', and ''cells''.   In the case below there are two rows, each with only one cell in them.   Each part of a table has properties that affect it, and an example of typical table coding can be seen in the listing below.

&lt;table cellpadding=20px style=&quot;font-family:courier;border:1px dashed blue;background:#f9f9f9;;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td align=left&gt;&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|style=&quot;background:lightyellow;width:150px;margin:none;border:1px solid lightgrey&quot; align=left
|-
|  style= &quot; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0 0 0&quot;|'''Heading'''
|- style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;
|  style=&quot;padding:0px 10px 10px 10px;&quot;|Content.
|}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
{{-}}
Running this code in the sandbox produces the following:
{{-}} 
{| style=&quot;background:lightyellow;width:150px;margin:none;border:1px solid lightgrey&quot; align=left
|-
|  style= &quot;text-align: center; padding: 5px 0 0 0&quot;|'''Heading'''
|- style= &quot;text-align:justify;&quot;
|  style= &quot;padding:0px 10px 10px 10px;&quot;|Content.
|}
{{-}}

If necessary, refer to the WikiBooks text [[../Tables|'''Making Tables''']] or the Wikipedia text [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table '''Help-Table'''] for detailed advice on making tables.   Refer also to the drop-down box below for a listing of the commonly used table properties and their meanings.
{{tablestyles}}
{{-}}
For now, it will suffice to note only that:
*A table is enclosed in these symbols: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{|  |}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
*A caption placed above the table starts with a '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|+&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.
*A heading cell within the table starts with a '''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
*A new row is created with the symbols: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' 
*A data cell within a row is created with the symbol: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' 
*Style statements can exist at the table, row, or cell levels.
*An additional pipe symbol separates a cell's styles from its text.''' &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''  
*Starting tables, rows and cells on new lines avoids many problems in templates. 

Follow the reasoning in this description from the code.

The table container has ''background'', ''width'', ''margin'', and ''border'' properties, and the ''align'' attribute assigned.
*''Background'';sets the background color for the whole table. 
*''Width''; sets the overall width of the table. 
*''Margin''; removes margins of the table.
*''Border'': Sets the thickness, type, and color of the table border, all in one.
*''Align'': Permits the box to be placed on the page at ''left'', ''right'', or ''center''.    


The cell in the first row has ''text-align'',''padding'', and a form of heading text.
*''Text-align'';positions the cell text horizontally at the center.
*''Padding''; sets the padding within the first cell for the box heading text.
*''The Heading Text''; is made bold with Wiki mark-up.


The next row has ''text-align''.   This property applies style to all of the cells in the row at once, though not all properties can do this.
*''Text-align'';justifies text in the bottom cell - the main content.


The ''content'' cell has ''padding'', and the content text.
*''Padding'';sets the spacing around the content text.
*''The content text''; is the main text for the box template.    
 
Other properties could be specified for this text box, for example, for the details of the fonts to use, but there is enough here for this example.


====Parameters and Options====
It is intended to provide three ''options'' along with the two ''parameters''.   The options are to be ''background'',''width'', and ''align''.   The parameter ''names'' are to be ''1'' and ''2'', with the labels ''heading'' and ''content''.

The options and parameters have been added to the code below:

&lt;table cellpadding=20px style=&quot;font-family:courier;border:1px dashed blue;background:#f9f9f9;;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td align=left&gt;&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|style=&quot;background:{{{background|lightyellow}}};width:{{{width|150px}}};margin:none;border:1px solid lightgrey&quot; align={{{align|left}}}
|  style= &quot; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0 0 0&quot;|'''{{{Heading|{{{1}}}}}}'''
|- style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;
|  style=&quot;padding:0px 10px 10px 10px;&quot;|{{{Content|{{{2}}}}}}
|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
{{-}}
'''Parameters''' have been made in place of the ''heading'' and ''content'' text.   The formats for parameters one and two are:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{heading|{{{1}}}}}} and {{{content|{{{2}}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
{{-}}
Each parameter format consists of a parameter ''label'',( ''heading'' or ''content''), a ''pipe'',  symbol,'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', and the true ''name'' of the parameter, (''1'' or ''2'').   In each case, both the parameter name ''and'' the entire parameter expression are enclosed in triple curly brackets. '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.


'''Options''' have been made for the properties ''background'', ''width'', and ''align''.   The formats are :
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;background:{{{background|lightyellow}}}  width:{{{width|150px}}} and align={{{align|left}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
{{-}}

Notice that the format of the bracketing is similar to the examples given in the making of text templates, and that the same strict format is used to identify the options and parameters.

'''A parameter can use the ''option'' format too'''.   When a parameter does so, it must use the ''named'' parameter style in the template call.   The advantage of such a parameter is that it can have ''any'' default value, including an image.  The disadvantage of using the ''option'' format for a ''parameter'' is that the highly conspicuous numbered reminder is lost.  You will recall that the more formal parameter style gives a parameter number as the default.

The template can be saved in the usual way.   Assuming that the template were saved with the name ''Textbox'', then it could be called for use by typing the following:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{textbox|background=lightgrey|width=325px|align=center|Heading text here|Content text here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}   
The variations in boxes are considerable.   By adjusting the table structure, it is possible to add images and other effects.   Most of the information boxes within Wikipedia and WikiBooks have a table basis for their construction.



===Making Drop Controls===
----
Drop-boxes save space on the page and can be used for both text and for images.  Within Wikibooks these boxes are dynamic, and clicking the link on the heading of such a box drops it  box to show the entire contents section.   Clicking the link again restores it to its closed state.

Drop-boxes can be created in two ways. In the past, the way to make them was to use the classes ''NavFrame'', ''NavHead'', and ''NavContent''. These days, the ''collapsible'' class can be used for both tables and div boxes, its simplicity has made it a clear choice in the making of drop-boxes. The first section describes briefly the layout for collapsible divs. The remainder of the section is devoted to the version based on the collapsible table; this method is the basis of the ''ready-made'' drop-control template [[Template:Dropimage|'''Dropimage''']]. 

A ready-made template exists for a quite adaptable drop-box; it is [[Template:Dropimage|'''Dropimage''']], though for those who want the details, they are to be had at [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables#Sorting_and_Hiding|'''Sorting and Hiding''']].   

====Collapsible Boxes====
The basic code for drop-boxes is just:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;
Hideable content
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The above code produces a drop-box that extended across the whole width of the page. ''collapsible'' contains the other two sections, ''title'' refers to the panel with the link, and ''body'' refers to the text box within the drop box itself.

By default, the contents is hidden when the page is loaded. To have the contents shown by default, the user adds &quot;selected&quot; to the class declaration.  CSS styles could also be added as shown below and the option-brackets and parameter-brackets for template-making have been shown, as was explained in the previous section:
 
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible selected&quot; style=&quot;color:{{{color|darkgray}}}; width:{{{width|300px}}}; {{#switch:{{{align|center}}}|center=margin:auto;|left=float:left;|right=float:right;}}&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:{{{bold|bold}}};&quot;&gt;{{{Heading|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot; style=&quot;background-color:{{{background|lightyellow}}};color:{{{color2|black}}}&quot;&gt;
{{{Content|{{{2}}}}}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Changes in layout is obtained by changing styles in any of the sections, but the preferred method, using collapsible tables, is described in the next section.


====Collapsible Tables====
(currently being rewritten to update for collapsible tables)
The panel below shows the HTML and Wikitext code versions of a fairly basic drop-box based on the ''collapsible'' box class.   The two versions are equivalent, though users who intend to make a template should use the HTML version, since it can have a table as its content without any instability.   Nesting tables in Wikitext is problematic.

'''HTML Collapsible Table Cell'''
&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;collapsible&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; width:300px;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5px&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;Any Heading&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Content cell text, images or HTML tables&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;


'''WIKITEXT''' Collapsible Table Cell
&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{| class=&quot;collapsible&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; width:300px;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5px&quot;
 |-
 ! style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | Any Heading
 |-
 |  Content cell text or images only
 |}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

If, instead of the ''collapsed'' state, the ''selected'' state is needed on opening the page, then just add the class ''selected'' as in the line ''class=&quot;collapsible selected&quot; ''.   The default state is ''collapsed'' which need not be added.

The ''width'' style in the table line sets the ''initial'' width of the table on the page, and with the exception of un-formatted text, the table will expand on opening to accommodate the contents.

The ''float'' and ''align'' attributes should be avoided for tables because browsers may not support table alignment. Tables can be aligned in a way compatible with most browsers by setting the initial width of the table to 100%, and by wrapping the table inside a div box with its width set to the desired width. For left and right alignment use float on the div box. For center alignment use a margin of auto on the div.

====Parameters and Options====
The parameter and option brackets are shown in the panel below for an HTML version of the drop-box template, and it will be noted that the method is similar to that used for simple tables in an earlier section.   It may be of interest to note that the outermost table is there simply to allow centering of the entire structure, since the ''collapsible'' class does not support it.

'''A Basic Drop-Box Template Coding'''
&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border:none; align={{{alignT|left}}}&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;collapsible&quot; style=&quot;border:{{{border|1px solid black}}}; width:{{{width|300px}}}; background:{{{backgroundT|transparent}}};&quot;  cellpadding=&quot;{{{padding|5px}}}&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style=&quot;background:{{{backgroundH|transparent}}};text-align:center;&quot;&gt;{{{heading|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:{{{alignC|left}}};&quot;&gt; {{{content|{{{2}}}}}}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;
All other template page material goes between these tags.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
{{clear}}

The above HTML block of code has been saved as the template ''dropthing'', [[Template:Dropthing|'''Dropthing''']], and it can be called for use on a page by typing something along the lines of the following:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dropthing|backgroundT=mistyrose| alignT=center|width=400px| Press to View|[[image:Hawthorn blossom.jpg|400px|thumb|center|''Hawthorn in bloom''.]] }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}   

The drop-box that is produced with this template call is this:
{{dropthing|backgroundT=mistyrose|alignT=center|width=400px| Press to View|[[image:Hawthorn blossom.jpg|400px|thumb|center|''Hawthorn in bloom''.]] }}

{{-}}
A more complex ready-made template called [[Template:dropimage|'''Dropimage''']] exists for those who need it.  It has a large set of individual options, and the facility to add more properties and classes, the coding for which is described next.

===Advanced Options===
Although the user is always limited by the original template's design, he has some latitude afforded by the pre-planned options.    There is a way, however that allows the user to add  classes and CSS properties not considered in the original design.   For this method to work the designer of the template must anticipate the possible future need for such a change, and add a few extra keystrokes.   It is explained below.   

Because both ''class'' and ''style'' declarations are themselves HTML ''attributes'', in the same way as ''align'', ''cellpadding'', and many others, these two can also be made into options.


====Add Classes====
To allow user-changes to the classes for the above drop-table template, the class declaration (expression) line needs to modified as follows:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;class=&quot;{{{class|collapsible}}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  

This has the effect of making a new option called ''myclass'' that has a default value of ''collapsible''; that is, if no ''myclass'' option is written by the user the default will apply.   Now, having modified the class-declaration, the user could change the class ''on-the-fly'', (while making use of the template), as follows: 

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dropthing|backgroundT=mistyrose|class=collapsible selected| alignT=center|width=200px| Press to View|[[image:Hawthorn blossom.jpg|400px|thumb|center|''Hawthorn in bloom''.]] }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

The box produced in this way is just:   
{{dropthing|backgroundT=mistyrose|class=collapsible selected|alignT=center|width=200px| Press to View|[[image:Hawthorn blossom.jpg|400px|thumb|center|''Hawthorn in bloom''.]] }}

The template, for this box only, will be displayed in its open state, since the class ''selected'' has been added as an option.   Notice that the intended classes ''all'' need to be declared, and that the quotes were not needed. This entry entirely replaces the default class declaration.  Similarly, other classes could be used, though the set of classes available for the automatic formatting of tables could do with some extension.

====More Style Options====
To modify the template to add user-written style expressions, the template's existing style expression in the table line would be replaced as follows:

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;{{{mystyleT|border:{{{border|1px solid black}}}; width:{{{width|300px}}}; background:{{{backgroundT|transparent}}} }}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}

Notice that the entire CSS style expression, (but not the attributes that followed it)), are now the default value of the ''mystyleT option''.   When this option is used in a template call the quotes for the value expression should not be used.

The typical template call, introducing new properties might then become:   

{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dropthing|myclass=collapsible| alignT=center|mystyleT=border:3px solid brown; width:300px; background:mistyrose;color:darkgreen; font-weight:bold|Press to View|[[image:Hawthorn blossom.jpg|400px|thumb|center|''Hawthorn in bloom''.]] }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

and the result of making this template call is just:
{{dropthing|myclass=collapsible|alignT=center|mystyleT=border:3px solid brown; width:300px; background:mistyrose;color:darkgreen; font-weight:bold;|Press to View|[[image:Hawthorn blossom.jpg|thumb|400px|center|''Hawthorn in bloom''.]]&lt;br&gt;Other text could go here... }}

{{-}}
Notice that the intended new style statement must be rewritten in its entirety, and that now a  new CSS property (color of text), not included in the original design, has been added within the option statement.

If the mystyleT option were not used, the individual options could still be used.   If ''both'' the expression and the individual values are changed, it would be as well to study the possibility that one will override the other.

The template [[Template:Dropimage|'''Dropimage''']] has been modified to include user modification of class and style.

===Endpiece===
The three example types given in the above sections will hopefully introduce the reader to the making of templates.   Bear in mind that there are many aspects of templates not discussed here; for example, the notions of conditional behavior, loops, and defaults that themselves run as templates. Further reading about templates can be found in the links below.

Above all, learn how to use CSS styles in making your templates, and experiment with their effects.

== Built-in PMCs ==

Parrot ships with a number of PMC data types built in. This means that these standard types are always available. This page is going to serve as a reference to these PMC types. We will not attempt to cover all the PMC types that are added specifically for other HLLs, libraries, or programs. 
(For information on using these PMC types, and on defining new PMC types, see the [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Polymorphic Containers (PMCs)]] chapter).

The entries in this list should (A) contain a link to the relevant PMC documentation, and (B) provide a brief overview of the PMC and it's methods. 

=== AddrRegistry ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mesopotamia==
Is such a detailed discussion of Mesopotamia needed, in a textbook on Iran? [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 16:47, 8 April 2008 (UTC)

==Copyright infringement?==
Certain sections seem to be the same as an article in [http://www.iranreview.org/content/view/5070/51/ Iran Review]. (or Iran Daily) i.e. 
:First untitled paragraph.
:Old Stone Age or Paleolithic Age (most of this section)
:New Stone Age or Neolithic Age (first 2 paragraphs)
:The Rise of Mesopotamia (whole section)
:Uruk (whole section)
:Early dynastic Sumer (whole section)
:Akkad (whole section)
:Mittani and the Hittites (first halves of paragraphs 1 &amp; 3, all of para 2)
:Assyria and Neo-Babylonia (whole section)
:The Zayandeh-Rud Civilization (first 2 paragraphs)
:Jiroft Civilization (first and last paragraphs)

(although from the date of the Iran Review article, Nov 2009, the copying may have been from Wikibooks.)

Recently added sections seem copied from various sites, i.e.

:[http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=2676.0 Atlantis Online] dated March 15 2006
::Jiroft (first para)

:[http://davidcortright.com/research-topics/iraq/persian-journeyimpressions-from-visiting-iran/ David Cortright] dated January 2008.
::Jiroft (2nd para)

:[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200405/what.was.jiroft..htm Saudi Aramco World] dated September/October 2004.
::Jiroft (last para)

:[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/302/5647/973 Science magazine] dated 7th November 2003]
::BRONZE AGE FIND (full text not available, but whole section is suspect)

== Parrot Grammar Engine ==
{{Wikipedia|Perl 6 rules}}
The Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE) is an implementation of Perl 6's regular expression syntax on Parrot. The Perl 6 regular expression syntax is much more powerful and expressive than the regular expression syntax in Perl 5. Since regular expression implementations in many other languages are based on the Perl 5 implementation, Perl 6 is more powerful than those too. The Perl 6 regular expression and grammar syntax is very similar to parser generators like the Perl 5 module &quot;Parse::RecDescent&quot;, or the parser-generator programs Yacc and Bison. Unlike Yacc/Bison, however, the Perl 6 grammar engine uses a recursive descent algorithm instead of an LALR one. The differences are not important to the casual reader, but we will go into some more details about them later.

Perl 6 grammars are combinations of lexical analyzers (which break the source code into tokens) and parsers (which combine tokens into patterns). The lexical analysis portion of the grammar is the regular expression engine. The parser portion of the grammar engine is the rules system that we will describe here.

{{info|The first half of this chapter will cover some background about parsers and parsing algorithms. If you are already familiar with parsers, you can skip down to the section on '''Rules and Actions'''.}}

== Parsers and Terminology ==

Before we talk about PGE any further, we need to discuss some more terminology, and we also need to take a quick look at the algorithms that parsers use. By understanding the algorithms and the limitations of those algorithms, you the compiler designer should be able to employ these tools more optimally.

Input to a compiler is a source code file, written in a particular high-level language, which consists of various components. Consider the following statement in the C programming language:

 int x = add_both(5, 4);

This statement needs to be broken up into smaller chunks which represent the individual components. A chunk, as we have already seen, is called a &quot;token&quot;. The regular expression engine, the lexical analyzer, is used to break the input into tokens by iteratively matching the input against known regular expressions. Using this method, the statement above can be broken down into the following tokens:

 KEYWORD IDENTIFIER OPERATOR IDENTIFIER PAREN INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER PAREN 
  &quot;int&quot;     &quot;x&quot;        &quot;=&quot;   &quot;add_both&quot;  &quot;(&quot;    &quot;5&quot;     &quot;,&quot;      &quot;4&quot;    &quot;)&quot;

Notice that the whitespace has been removed from the list, so only the &quot;important&quot; stuff is turned into a token. Each token has two important pieces of information: The type (&quot;KEYWORD&quot;, &quot;IDENTIFIER&quot;, etc) and a value (&quot;int&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, etc). The parser can arrange the token types into a pattern, and the actions can use the token values to construct the PAST parse tree. 

An ordered group of tokens is called a '''string''' if it matches a given input pattern for the parser. The set of all strings which are valid for a compiler is called the '''language'''. The rules that specify this language is called a '''grammar'''.

The third part of a compiler is the '''back end'''. The back end, also called the '''target code generator''', turns the intermediate data representation of the input source (the parse tree) and converts it into the target language. In our case, the target language is PIR or PBC. All compilers are formed from these three key components: The lexical analyzer, the parser, and the back end. Parrot provides regular expressions for the lexical analyzer, and it handles all the target language generation. The only thing you, as a compiler designer, need to design is the parser. However, there is a lot of information about parsers that we need to know first.

There are two methods to parse a string of input tokens. First, we can do a '''top-down''' parse where we start with our highest-level token and try to find a match. Second, we can do a '''bottom-up''' parse where we start with the small tokens and try to combine them into bigger and bigger tokens until we have the highest-level. The ultimate goal of both parsing methods is to reduce the string of input tokens into a single match token. 

=== Bottom-Up Parse ===

{{SideBox|'''note:'''&lt;br&gt;Parser-generators such as '''yacc''' or '''Bison''' produce bottom-up parsers.}}

As a simple bottom-up parse example, we will start at the left side of our string of tokens and try to combine small tokens into bigger ones. What we want, in the end, is a token that represents the entire input. We do this by utilizing two fundamental operations: '''shift''' and '''reduce'''. A shift operation means we read a new input token into the parser. A reduce operation means we turn a matched pattern of small tokens into a single larger token. Let's put this method into practice below.
{{-}}

 KEYWORD IDENTIFIER OPERATOR IDENTIFIER PAREN INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER PAREN 
  &quot;int&quot;     &quot;x&quot;        &quot;=&quot;   &quot;add_both&quot;  &quot;(&quot;    &quot;5&quot;     &quot;,&quot;      &quot;4&quot;    &quot;)&quot;

The above string turns into the string below if we realize that the tokens &quot;int&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are a variable declaration. We reduce the first two tokens into a variable declaration token:

 DECLARATION OPERATOR IDENTIFIER PAREN INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER PAREN 
                &quot;=&quot;   &quot;add_both&quot;  &quot;(&quot;    &quot;5&quot;     &quot;,&quot;      &quot;4&quot;    &quot;)&quot;

Now, we move through the line, shifting tokens into the parser from left to right. We can't see anything that we can reduce until we reach the parenthesis. We can reduce the open and close parenthesis, and all the tokens in the middle of them into an argument list as shown below:

 DECLARATION OPERATOR IDENTIFIER ARGUMENT_LIST 
                &quot;=&quot;   &quot;add_both&quot; 

Now, we know that when we have an identifier followed by an argument list, that it is a function call. We reduce these two tokens to a single function call token:

 DECLARATION OPERATOR FUNCTION_CALL
                &quot;=&quot;   

And finally, by skipping a few steps, we can convert this into an assignment statement:

 ASSIGNMENT_STATEMENT

Every time we reduce a set of small tokens into a bigger token, we add them to the tree. We add the small tokens as children of the bigger token. This type of parser that we are talking about here is called a &quot;shift-reduce&quot; parser because those are the actions the parser performs. A subset of shift-reduce parsers that are useful for arithmetic expressions is called an '''operator precedence parser''', and is one that we will talk about more below. 

{{TextBox|;Note:Shift-reduce parsers are prone to a certain type of error called a '''shift-reduce conflict'''. A shift-reduce conflict is caused when a new input token can cause the parser to either shift or reduce. In other words, the parser has more then one option for the input token. A grammar that contains possible shift-reduce conflicts is called an '''ambiguous grammar'''. While there are ways to correct such a conflict, it is often better to redesign the language grammar to avoid them entirely. For more information on this, see the '''Resources''' section at the bottom of the page.}}

=== Top-Down Parse ===

A '''top-down''' parser is a little bit different from a bottom-up parser. We start with the highest level token, and we try to make a match by testing for smaller patterns. This process can be inherently inefficient, because we must often test many different patterns before we can find one that matches. However, we gain an ability to avoid shift-reduce conflicts and also gain a certain robustness because our parser is attempting multiple options before giving up. Let's say that we have a string of tokens, and a top-level definition for a STATEMENT token. Here is the definition in a format called a '''context-free grammar''':

 STATEMENT := ASSIGNMENT | FUNCTION_CALL | DECLARATION

This is a simple example, of course, and certainly not enough to satisfy a language like C. The &quot;:=&quot; symbol is analogous to the words &quot;is made of&quot;. The vertical bar &quot;|&quot; is the same as saying &quot;or&quot;. So, the statement above says &quot;A statement is made of an assignment or a function call or a declaration&quot;.  

We have this grammar rule that tells us what a statement is, and we have our string of input tokens:

 KEYWORD IDENTIFIER OPERATOR IDENTIFIER PAREN INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER PAREN 
  &quot;int&quot;     &quot;x&quot;        &quot;=&quot;   &quot;add_both&quot;  &quot;(&quot;    &quot;5&quot;     &quot;,&quot;      &quot;4&quot;    &quot;)&quot;

The top-down parser will try each alternative in the STATEMENT definition to see if it matches. If one doesn't match, it moves to the next one and tries again. So, we try the ASSIGNMENT rule, and ASSIGNMENT is defined like this:

 ASSIGNMENT := (VARIABLE_NAME | DECLARATION) '=' (EXPRESSION | FUNCTION_CALL)

Parenthesis are used to group things together. In English, this statement says &quot;An assignment is a variable name or a declaration, followed by a '=' followed by an expression or a function call&quot;. So, to satisfy ASSIGNMENT, we try VARIABLE_NAME first, and then we try DECLARATION. The string &quot;int x&quot; is a declaration and not a simple variable name, so VARIABLE_NAME fails, and DECLARATION succeeds. Next, the '=' matches. To satisfy the last group, we try EXPRESSION first, which fails, and then we try FUNCTION_CALL, which succeeds. We proceed this way, trying alternatives and slowly moving down to smaller and smaller tokens, until we've matched the entire input string. Once we have matched the last input token, if we have also satisfied the top-level match, the parser succeeds.

This type of parser is called a &quot;recursive descent&quot; parser, because we recurse into each subrule, and slowly descend from the top of the parse tree to the bottom. Once the last subrule succeeds, the whole match succeeds and the parser returns.

In this process, when a rule matches, we create a node in our PAST tree. Because we test all subrules first before a rule succeeds, all the children nodes are created before the higher-level nodes are created. This creates the parse tree from the bottom going up, even though we started at the top of the tree and moved down.

Top-down parsers can be inefficient because the parser will attempt to match patterns that obviously cannot succeed. However, there are techniques that we can use to &quot;prune&quot; the tree of possibilities by directing the parser towards certain paths or stopping it from going down branches that will not match. We can also prevent the parser from backtracking from subrules back up to larger rules, which helps to reduce unnecessary repetition.

== Rules And Actions ==

A recursive descent parser, like the one used in PGE, is a top-down parser. This means it attempts to start at the highest-level definition and work its way down to match the given input. The top-level rule is always called TOP. After that, we can create as many other rules as we need to in order to specify our entire grammar. Let's start by creating a very simple recursive descent parser to try and  parse the input that we gave earlier:

 int x = add_both(5, 4);

Here is part of our basic parser:

&lt;pre&gt;
rule TOP {
  &lt;assignment&gt; | &lt;function_call&gt; | &lt;declaration&gt;
}

rule assignment {
  &lt;lvalue&gt; '=' &lt;rvalue&gt;
}

rule lvalue {
  &lt;variable_name&gt; | &lt;variable_declaration&gt;
}

rule rvalue {
  &lt;expression&gt; | &lt;function_call&gt;
}

rule function_call {
  &lt;identifier&gt; '(' &lt;arguments&gt; ')'
}

rule variable_declaration {
   'int' &lt;identifier&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is only part of the parser, but the idea should be clear. We define each rule in terms of constants or other rules. The angle brackets &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; indicate that we need to match a subrule. Single quotes are used to indicate something that is a literal string constant.

=== Basic Rules ===

Rules have a couple basic operators that we can use, some of which have already been discussed. People who are familiar with regular expressions will recognize most of them.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Op !! What It Means 
! width=&quot;35%&quot; | Example 
! Explanation
|-
| &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; || &quot;zero or more of&quot; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;number&gt;* '.' &lt;number&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || Accepts a string with zero-or-more numbers, followed by a period, followed by 1 number. Example: 1234.5
|-
| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; || &quot;one or more of&quot; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;letter&gt;+ &lt;number&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || One-or-more letters, followed by a number. Example: abcde5, or ghij6
|-
| &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; || &quot;one or zero&quot; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;number&gt;? '.' &lt;number&gt;+ || An optional number followed by a period and a string of one-or-more numbers. Examples: 1.234 or .234
|-
| &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; || Group || &lt;code&gt;&lt;letter&gt; [&lt;letter&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;number&gt;]* &lt;/code&gt; || A letter followed by any amount of letters or number. Example: a123, ident, wiki2txt
|}

We have already discussed the or operator &quot;|&quot;. Here are some examples.

{{TextBox|1=
;Decimal Numbers: 

&lt;pre&gt;
rule decimal_numbers {
   &lt;digit&gt;* '.' &lt;digit&gt;+
  |&lt;digit&gt;+ '.' &lt;digit&gt;*
}
&lt;/pre&gt; 
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Function Parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
rule function_parameters {
   '(' [ &lt;identifier&gt; [ ',' &lt;identifier&gt; ]* ]? ')'
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

=== Actions ===

As it successfully matches rules, PGE creates a special &quot;match object&quot;, which contains information about the match. This match object can be sent to a function written in PIR or NQP for processing. The processing function that receives the match object is called the '''action'''. Each rule in the grammar has an associated action function with the same name. 

When we have completed a successful match, we need to send the match object to the action method. We do this with the special symbol &lt;code&gt;{*}&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;{*}&lt;/code&gt; sends the current match object, not necessarily the complete one. You can call &lt;code&gt;{*}&lt;/code&gt; multiple times in a rule to invoke the action method multiple times, if needed. Here is an example:

&lt;pre&gt;
rule k_r {
   {*}       #Calls the action method with an empty match object
   'hello'
   {*}       #calls the action method after matching 'hello'
   'world'
   {*}       #Calls the action method after matching 'hello' 'world'
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are two important points to remember about action methods:

#The parser moves from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. In the k_r example above, if the input was &quot;hello johnny&quot;, the action method would get called the first two times, but the rule would fail to match  the word &quot;world&quot; and the action method would not be called the third time. 
#The parser returns after a successful match, even if there are more possibilities to try. Consider this example below, where only one of the action methods can be called depending on the result of the alternation. In this example, if the input is &quot;hello franky&quot;, the action method only gets called for the &lt;code&gt;{*}&lt;/code&gt; after 'franky'. After that matches, the parser returns and does not try to match 'johnny'. 

&lt;pre&gt;
rule say_hello {
  'hello'
   [
     | 'tommy' {*}
     | 'franky' {*}
     | 'johnny' {*}
   ]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It can be very helpful sometimes to specify which action method got called, when there is a list of possibilities. This is because we want to treat certain matches differently from others. to treat an action method differently, we use a special comment syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;
rule say_hello {
  'hello'
   [
     | 'tommy' {*}  #= tommy
     | 'franky' {*} #= franky
     | 'johnny' {*} #= johnny
   ]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The special &quot;#=&quot; symbol is not a regular comment. Instead, it's a second parameter for the action method called a &quot;key&quot;. If you use &quot;#=&quot;, the action method will receive two arguments: the match object and the key. You can then test the value of the key to determine how to treat the match object. We will discuss this more in the next chapter about NQP.

== HLL Compilers ==

Now that we know NQP and PGE, we have the tools that we need to start writing a compiler for our favorite language. Let's review the steps to creating a compiler:

#Write Grammar using PGE
#Write Actions using NQP
#Actions create PAST tree
#PCT converts PAST into PIR
#Parrot converts PIR into bytecode. 

After step 5, if we have done everything correctly, we should have a working compiler. Of course, there is a lot of work to do before we reach step 5. Lucky for us, however, steps 4 and 5 are automated by the build process, so we only need to worry about 1, 2, and 3. In the [[Parrot Virtual Machine#Tutorials|Tutorials section]] we are going to have several language-building tutorials that you can follow. 

== Creating a PAST Tree ==

PAST nodes are objects that your NQP Action methods must create. PCT automatically inserts these nodes into the tree once you create them. PAST nodes are complex objects with an array and a hash component. The array stores a list of references to the children nodes, and the hash stores information about the node itself. Creating the past tree means that we create nodes in lower-rules, and insert them into the array for higher rules. As we go, we set the necessary options for each rule, so that PCT can generate the appropriate code.

There is a reference for the various types of PAST nodes available in the appendix.

PAST::Node is the base class from which the other PAST node types are derived. The other types are PAST::Stmts, PAST::Val, PAST::Var, PAST::Op, and PAST::Block.

'''PAST::Op'''
:PAST::Op nodes are operations that need to be performed.
'''PAST::Val'''
:PAST::VAL nodes are constant values like integers or strings
'''PAST::Var'''
:PAST::Var nodes are variables
'''PAST::Block'''
:PAST::Block nodes are used for lexically scoping variables and defining subroutines. They keep other nodes together.
'''PAST::Stmts'''
:PAST::Stmts nodes are just groups of other nodes, and perform no task besides basic organization.

Once you have created the necessary node, you insert it into the parse tree with the keyword &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;.

== The Match Object ==

The Match object is a special object that contains a hash. The match object hash contains information about the matched rule. Each element in the hash is named after one of the sub-rules in the rule. For instance, if we have the following rule:

&lt;pre&gt;
rule sentence { 
  &lt;adjective&gt; &lt;noun&gt; &lt;adverb&gt; &lt;verb&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then the match rule would have entries &quot;adjective&quot;, &quot;noun&quot;, &quot;adverb&quot;, and &quot;verb&quot;. The value of the hash for each of these keys are the values that were returned from the subrules using the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; command, if any. So, we would have the following fields:

 $&lt;adjective&gt;
 $&lt;noun&gt;
 $&lt;adverb&gt;
 $&lt;verb&gt;

We would then use the values of each of these to produce and &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; a node for the &lt;code&gt;sentence&lt;/code&gt; rule. If each of these fields return PAST nodes of their own, we should push those

== Examples ==

We are going to show some very small examples here to demonstrate the basic compiler construction  method. More advanced tutorials are provided in the [[Parrot Virtual Machine#Tutorials|Tutorials section]].

=== Example: Basic Calculator ===

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem:
We want to create a basic calculator program that can perform addition and subtraction on integers. The calculator should print the result to the screen.
;Solution: We start by running &lt;code&gt;mk_language_shell.pl&lt;/code&gt; to create a basic language framework. This also produces a builtin function called &lt;code&gt;say&lt;/code&gt;. We are going to use the &lt;code&gt;say&lt;/code&gt; function to print results to the screen. We are going to use a basic top-down parser for this, we are not going to use an optable.

We create a basic grammar for our calculator:

&lt;pre&gt;
rule TOP {
  &lt;expression&gt;
  {*}
}

rule expression {
  &lt;term&gt; &lt;operation&gt; &lt;term&gt;
  {*}
}

token operation { '+' | '-' }

token term { \d+ }
&lt;/pre&gt;

We now need to create two actions, one for TOP and the other for expression. The TOP method should take the value of the parsed expression and pass that to the &lt;code&gt;say&lt;/code&gt; function. The expression function should generate the necessary PIR operations, and insert the &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; values into these operations. Here is a basic actions file to do this:

&lt;pre&gt;
method TOP($/) {
  my $past := PAST::Op.new(:pasttype('inline'));
  my $expr := $( $&lt;expression&gt; );
  $past.inline('say(%0)');
  $past.unshift($expr);
  make $past;
}

method expression($/) {
  my $left := $( $&lt;term&gt;[0] );
  my $right := $( $&lt;term&gt;[1] );
  my $op := $( $&lt;operation&gt; );
  my $pirop := &quot;sub_n&quot;;
  if $op eq &quot;+&quot; {
    my $pirop := &quot;add_n&quot;;
  }
  my $past := PAST::Op.new(:pasttype('pirop'), :pirop($pirop));
  $past.unshift($left);
  $past.unshift($right);
  make $past;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

:::I strongly disagree that 'All wikiprojects should use Wikibooks:Wikiproject XXXXXXX as the format to avoid any such conflicts.' If you are concerned about the conflicts a better way is to redirect Wikibooks:Wikiproject XXXXXXX to whatever format is choosen. It's quite inappropriate to change existing wikibooks that have already been branded with a name, and known as that name from many links in wikibooks and elsewhere (like wikipedia). Also the practical problem of the name 'Wikibooks:Wikiproject XXXXXXX' being to long to sensible displayed in sidebars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[../Image Resizer for Windows|Image Resizer for Windows]] is a replacement for Resize-O-Matic that works with Windows 7'''

Ever need to simply resize a mass of images with ease? Resize-O-Matic is a quick and convenient way to do that. It will add a new option to your ''context-menu''.

[[Image:Resize_o_matic_context.png|frame|right||The text-option that Resize-O-Matic will install.]]

== Downloading ==
*Download the program directly at [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/imgresizer/Resize-O-Matic-0.3.0-beta.exe?download at the source forge site]{{ref|current}}
*Or, browse to [http://sourceforge.net/projects/imgresizer/ the SourceForge project for Resize-O-Matic] &amp;rarr; Select Download &amp;rarr; Download the file ending in &lt;tt&gt;.exe&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Installing ==
# Double click the icon
# Click &lt;tt&gt;Next&lt;/tt&gt; until you can no longer hit &lt;tt&gt;Next&lt;/tt&gt;.
# Click &lt;tt&gt;Finish&lt;/tt&gt;

{{clear}}
== Using ==
[[Image:Resize_o_matic_default_options.png|frame|right||The basic options of Resize-o-matic]]

When Resize-o-matic resizes images, it does not by default replace the original copy. It just saves another copy under a new name. For instance, if you resize ''foo.jpg'' you will have a new file named ''foo (Small).jpg''.
# Select image(s)
# Select desired size
#* For the purpose of the web you almost surely want 640x480.
# Click Ok

=== Advanced Usage ===

Resize-O-Matic also supports a few &quot;advanced&quot; options. They aren't really all that advaned.
# Custom resizing dimensions
# Make pictures smaller but not larger
# Resize the original pictures (don't create copies!).
#* This is probably the most useful feature.

== Introduction ==

This is the first episode in a tutorial series on building a compiler with the Parrot Compiler Tools. If you're interested in virtual machines, you've probably heard of the Parrot virtual machine. Parrot is a generic virtual machine designed for dynamic languages. This is in contrast with the Java virtual machine (JVM) and Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR), both of which were designed to run static languages. Both the JVM and Microsoft (through the Dynamic Language Runtime -- DLR) are adding support for dynamic languages, but their primary focus is still static languages.

== High Level Languages ==

The main purpose of a virtual machine is to run programs. These programs are typically written in some High Level Language (HLL). Some well-known dynamic languages (sometimes referred to as scripting languages) are Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. Parrot is designed to be able to run all these languages. Each language that Parrot hosts needs a compiler to parse the syntax of the language and generate Parrot instructions.

If you've never implemented a programming language (and maybe even if you have implemented a language), you might consider writing a compiler a bit of a black art. I know I did when I became interested. And you know what? It is. Compilers are complex programs, and implementing a language can be very difficult.

The Facts: 1) Parrot is suitable for running virtually any dynamic language known, but before doing so, compilers must be written, and 2) writing compilers is rather difficult.

== The Parrot Compiler Toolkit ==

Enter the Parrot Compiler Toolkit (PCT). In order to make Parrot an interesting target for language developers, the process of constructing a compiler should be supported by the right tools. Just as any construction task becomes much easier if you have the right tools (you wouldn't build a house using only your bare hands, would you?), the same is true for constructing a compiler. The PCT was designed to do just that: provide powerful tools to make writing a compiler for Parrot childishly easy.

This tutorial will introduce the PCT by demonstrating the ease with which a (simple) language can be implemented for Parrot. The case study language is not as complex as a real-world language, but this tutorial is written to whet your appetite and show the power of the PCT. This tutorial will also present some exercises which you can explore in order to learn more details of the PCT not covered in this tutorial.

== Squaak: A Simple Language ==

The case study language, named Squaak, that we will be implementing on Parrot will be a full-fledged compiler that can compile a program from source into Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR) (or run the PIR immediately). It can also be used as a command-line interpreter. Squaak demonstrates some common language constructs, but at the same time is lacking some other, seemingly simple features. For instance, our language will not have return, break or continue statements (or equivalents in your favorite syntax).

Squaak will have the following features:

* global and local variables
* basic types: integer, floating-point and strings
* aggregate types: arrays and hash tables
* operators: +, -, /, *, %, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=, .., and, or, not
* subroutines and parameters
* assignments and various control statements, such as &quot;if&quot; and &quot;while&quot;

As you can see, a number of common (more advanced) features are missing.
Most notable are:

* classes and objects
* exceptional control statements such as break and return
* advanced control statements such as switch
* closures (nested subroutines and accessing local variables in an outer scope)

== The Compiler Tools ==

The Parrot Compiler Tools we'll use to implement Squaak consist of the following parts:

* Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE). The PGE is an advanced engine for regular expressions. Besides regexes as found in Perl 5, it can also be used to define language grammars, using Perl 6 syntax. (Check the references for the specification.)
* Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree (PAST). The PAST nodes are a set of classes defining generic abstract syntax tree nodes that represent common language constructs.
* HLLCompiler class. This class is the compiler driver for any PCT-based compiler.
* Not Quite Perl (6) (NQP). NQP is a lightweight language inspired by Perl 6 and can be used to write the methods that must be executed during the parsing phase, just as you can write actions in a Yacc/Bison input file.

== Getting Started ==

For this tutorial, it is assumed you have successfully compiled parrot (and maybe even run the test suite). If you browse through the languages directory in the Parrot source tree, you'll find a number of language implementations. Most of them are not complete yet; some are actively maintained actively and others aren't. If, after reading this tutorial, you feel like contributing to one of these languages, you can check out the mailing list or join IRC (see the references section for details).

The languages subdirectory is the right spot to put our language implementation. Parrot comes with a special Perl5 script to generate the necessary files for a language implementation. Before it can be run, parrot must be installed for development. From parrot's root directory, type:

    $ make install-dev

In order to generate a new directory containing files for our language, type (assuming you're in parrot's root directory):

    $ perl tools/dev/mk_language_shell.pl Squaak

(Note: if you're on Windows, you should use backslashes.) This will generate the files in a directory &quot;squaak&quot;, and use the name &quot;Squaak&quot; as the language's name. After this, go to this directory and type:

    $ parrot setup.pir test

This will compile the generated files and run the test suite. If you want more information on what files are being generated, please check out the references at the end of this episode.

Note that we didn't write a single line of code, and already we have the basic infrastructure in place to get us started. Of course, the generated compiler doesn't even look like the language we will be implementing, but that's ok for now. Later we'll adapt the grammar to accept our language.

Now you might want to actually run a simple script with this compiler. Launch your favorite editor, and put in this statement:

    say &quot;Squaak!&quot;;

Save the file (for instance as test.sq) and type:

    $ parrot squaak.pbc test.sq

This will run Parrot, specifying squaak.pbc as the file to be run by Parrot, which takes a single argument: the file test.sq. If all went well, you should see the following output:

    $ parrot squaak.pbc test.sq
    Squaak!

Instead of running a script file, you can also run the Squaak compiler as an interactive interpreter. Run the Squaak compiler without specifying a script file, and type the same statement as you wrote in the file:

    $ parrot squaak.pbc
    say &quot;Squaak!&quot;;

which will print:

    Squaak!

== What's Next? ==

This first episode of this tutorial is mainly an overview of what will be coming. Hopefully you now have a global idea of what the Parrot Compiler Tools are, and how they can be used to build a compiler targeting Parrot. If you want to check out some serious usage of the PCT, check out Rakudo (Perl 6 on Parrot) or Pynie (Python on Parrot).

The next episodes will focus on the step-by-step implementation of our language, including the following topics:

* structure of PCT-based compilers
* using PGE rules to define the language grammar
* implementing operator precedence using an operator precedence table
* using NQP to write embedded parse actions
* implementing language library routines

In the mean time, experiment for yourself. You are welcome to join us on IRC (see the References section for details). Any feedback on this tutorial is appreciated.

== Exercises ==

The exercises are provided at the end of each episode of this tutorial. In order to keep the length of this tutorial somewhat acceptable, not everything can be discussed in full detail. The answers and/or solutions to these exercises will be posted several days after the episode.

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 1 Advanced Interactive Mode:
Launch your favorite editor and look at the file src/Squaak/Compiler.pm, still in the directory squaak. This file is written in Not Quite Perl (&quot;NQP&quot;) and is compiled to src/gen_compiler.pir when you run parrot setup.pir test. It contains the setup for the compiler. The class HLL::Compiler defines methods to set a command-line banner and prompt for your compiler when it is running in interactive mode. For instance, when you run Python in interactive mode, you'll see:

    Python 2.6.5 (r265:79063, Apr  1 2010, 05:28:39)
    [GCC 4.4.3 20100316 (prerelease)] on linux2
    Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.

or something similar (depending on your Python installation and version). This text is called the command line banner. And while running in interactive mode, each line will start with:

    &gt;&gt;&gt;

which is called a prompt. For Squaak, we'd like to see the following when running in interactive mode (of course you can change this according to your personal taste):

    $ ../../parrot squaak.pbc
    Squaak for Parrot VM.
    &gt;

Add code to the file Compiler.pm to achieve this.
*Hint: Note that only double-quoted strings in NQP can interpret escape-characters such as '\n'.

;Answer:

Given the hints that were provided, it was probably not too hard to find the solution, which is shown below. This code can be found in the file Compiler.pm. The relevant lines are printed in bold.

    INIT {
        Squaak::Compiler.language('Squaak');
        Squaak::Compiler.parsegrammar(Squaak::Grammar);
        Squaak::Compiler.parseactions(Squaak::Actions);
        '''Squaak::Compiler.commandline_banner(&quot;Squaak for Parrot VM.\n&quot;);'''
        '''Squaak::Compiler.commandline_prompt('&gt; ');'''
    }

There are more options provided by the HLL::Compiler class that you can set, you should explore them all.

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
In the first episode, we introduced the Parrot Compiler Tools, and generated a very simple language using a shell script provided with the Parrot distribution. We also announced Squaak, a simple programming language developed specially for this tutorial. Squaak will be the case study to show how PCT can be used as a very effective set of tools to implement a language for Parrot. A list of features of Squaak was specified. If you felt lucky, you might even have tried to do the exercise at the end of the previous episode.

In this episode, we will take a closer look at the generated compiler. We shall check out the different stages of the compilation process, and show what's going on in PCT-based compilers.

== Under The Hood ==

Remember how we invoked our compiler in the previous episode? We can pass a file, or invoke the compiler without a command line argument, in which case our compiler enters the interactive mode. Consider the first case, passing the file test.sq, just as we did before:

    $ parrot squaak.pbc test.sq

When invoking our compiler like this, the file test.sq is compiled and the generated code (bytecode) is executed immediately by Parrot. How does this work, you might wonder. The interpretation of a script is done through a series of transformations, starting at the script source and ending in a format that can be executed by Parrot. Compilers built with the PCT (based on the HLL::Compiler class) can take a target option, to show one of the intermediate representations. This option can have the following values, corresponding to the four default compilation phases of an HLLCompiler object:

* --target=parse
* --target=past
* --target=post
* --target=pir

This is an example of using the target option set to &quot;parse&quot;, which will print the parse tree of the input to stdout:

    $ parrot squaak.pbc --target=parse test.sq

In interactive mode, giving this input:

    say 42;

will print this parse tree (without the line numbers):

     1 &quot;parse&quot; =&gt; PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;say 42;\n&quot; @ 0 {
     2     &lt;statementlist&gt; =&gt; PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;say 42;\n&quot; @ 0 {
     3         &lt;statement&gt; =&gt; ResizablePMCArray (size:1) [
     4             PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;say 42&quot; @ 0 {
     5                 &lt;statement_control&gt; =&gt; PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;say 42&quot; @ 0 {
     6                     &lt;EXPR&gt; =&gt; ResizablePMCArray (size:1) [
     7                         PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;42&quot; @ 4 {
     8                             &lt;integer&gt; =&gt; PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;42&quot; @ 4 {
     9                                 &lt;decint&gt; =&gt; PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;42&quot; @ 4
    10                                 &lt;VALUE&gt; =&gt; \parse[0][0]
    11                             }
    12                         }
    13                     ]
    14                     &lt;sym&gt; =&gt; PMC 'Regex;Match' =&gt; &quot;say&quot; @ 0
    15                 }
    16             }
    17         ]
    18     }
    19 }

When changing the value of the target option, the output changes into a different representation of the input. Why don't you try that right now?

So, a HLL::Compiler object has four compilation phases: parsing, construction of a Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree (PAST), construction of a Parrot Opcode Syntax Tree (POST), generation of Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR). After compilation, the generated PIR is executed immediately.

If your compiler needs additional stages, you can add them to your HLL::Compiler object. For Squaak, we will not need this, but for details, check out compilers/pct/src/PCT/HLLCompiler.pir.

We shall now discuss each compilation phase in more detail. The first two phases, parsing the input and construction of the PAST are executed simultaneously. Therefore, these are discussed together.

==Parse phase: match objects and PAST construction==

During the parsing phase, the input is analyzed using Perl 6's extended regular expressions, known as Rules (see Synopsis 5 for details). When a rule matches some input string, a so-called Match object is created. A Match object is a combined array and hashtable, implying it can be indexed by integers as well as strings. As rules typically consist of other (sub) rules, it is easy to retrieve a certain part of the match. For instance, this rule:

    rule if_statement {
        'if' &lt;expression&gt; 'then' &lt;statement&gt; 'end'
        {*}
    }

has two other subrules: expression and statement. The match object for the rule if_statement represents the whole string from if to end. When you're interested only in the expression or statement part, you can retrieve that by indexing the match object by the name of the subrule (in this case, expression and statement, respectively).

During the parse phase, the PAST is constructed. There is a small set of PAST node types, for instance, PAST::Var to represent variables (identifiers, such as print), PAST::Val to represent literal values (for instance, &quot;hello&quot; and 42), and so on. Later we shall discuss the various PAST nodes in more detail.

Now, you might wonder, at which point exactly is this PAST construction happening? This is where the special {*} symbol comes in, just below the string 'if' in the if_statement rule shown above. These special markers indicate that a parse action should be invoked. Such a parse action is just a method that has the same name as the rule in which it is written (in this case: if_statement). So, during the parsing phase, several parse actions are executed, each of which builds a piece of the total PAST representing the input string. More on this will be explained later.

The Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree is just a different representation of the same input string (your program being compiled). It is a convenient data structure to transform into something different (such as executable Parrot code) but also to do all sorts of analysis, such as compile-time type checking.

==PAST to POST==

After the parse phase during which the PAST is constructed, the &lt;code&gt;HLL::Compiler&lt;/code&gt; transforms this PAST into something called a '''Parrot Opcode Syntax Tree (POST)'''. The POST representation is also a tree structure, but these nodes are on a lower abstraction level. For instance, on the PAST level there is a node type to represent a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement (constructed as &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op.new( :pasttype('while') )&lt;/code&gt; ). The template for a while statement typically consists of a number of labels and jump instructions. On the POST level, the same while statement is represented by a set of nodes, each representing a one instruction or a label. Therefore, it is much easier to transform a POST into something executable than when this is done from the PAST level.

Usually, as a user of the PCT, you don't need to know details of POST nodes, which is why this will not be discussed in further detail. Use the target option to see what a POST looks like.

==POST to PIR==
In the fourth (and final) stage, the POST is transformed into Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR). As mentioned, transforming a POST into something executable is rather straightforward, as POST nodes already represent individual instructions and labels. Again, normal usage of the PCT does not require you to know any details about this transformation.

==And now for the good news...==
We established the general data flow of PCT-based compilers, which consists of four stages:

# source to parse tree
# parse tree to PAST
# PAST to POST
# POST to PIR

where we noted that the first two are done during the parse stage. Now, as you're reading this tutorial, you're probably interested in using the PCT for implementing Your Favorite Language for Parrot. We already saw that a language grammar is expressed in Perl 6 Rules. What about the other transformations?

Well, earlier in this episode we mentioned the term parse actions, and that these actions create PAST nodes. After you have written a parse action for each grammar rule, you're done!

==Say what?==

That's right. Once you have correctly constructed a PAST, your compiler can generate executable PIR, which means you just implemented your first language for Parrot. Of course, you still need to implement any language specific libraries, but that's besides the point.

PCT-based compilers already know how to transform a PAST into a POST, and how to transform a POST into PIR. These transformation stages are already provided by the PCT.

==What's next?==
In this episode we took a closer look at the internals of a PCT-based compiler. We discussed the four compilation stages, that transform an input string (a program, or script, depending on your definition) into a PAST, a POST and finally executable PIR.
The next episodes is where the Fun Stuff is: we will be implementing Squaak for Parrot. Piece by piece, we will implement the parser and the parse actions. Finally, we shall demonstrate John Conway's &quot;Game of Life&quot; running on Parrot, implemented in Squaak.

==Exercises==
Starting in the next episode, the exercises will be more interesting. For now, it would be useful to browse around through the source files of the compiler, and see if you understand the relation between the grammar rules in Grammar.pg and the methods in Actions.pm.

It's also useful to experiment with the --target option described in this episode. If you don't know PIR, now is the time to do some preparation for that. There's sufficient information to be found on PIR, see the References section for details. In the mean time, if you have any suggestions, questions and whatnot, don't hesitate to leave a comment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A word that functions as a pro-bridi is any word that temporarily has the same meaning as another bridi (such as a pro-sumti, or in English, a hypothetical &quot;pro-verb&quot;).

== Vocabulary ==

 cei             assigns a a pro-bridi from the ''broda series'' to a bridi (equivalent to [''goi''])
 broda           assigned pro-bridi (set meaning) #1
 brode           assigned pro-bridi (set meaning) #2
 brodi           assigned pro-bridi (set meaning) #3
 brodo           assigned pro-bridi (set meaning) #4
 brodu           assigned pro-bridi (set meaning) #5
 da'o            cancels pro-assigns
 go'a            repeats a recent bridi (usually not the last 2 but may be the antepenultimate)
 go'e            repeats the next to last (penultimate) bridi
 go'i            preceding bridi; in answer to a yes/no question, repeats the claim, meaning &quot;yes&quot;
 go'ira'o        pro-bridi: preceding bridi; repeats claim as true, updates speaker/listener change
                            true for me too
 go'o            repeats a future bridi, normally the next one
 go'u            repeats a remote past bridi
 mo              bridi/selbri/brivla question
 nei             repeats the current bridi
 no'a            repeats the bridi in which this one is embedded
 

== Additional Notes and/or Examples ==

*[''cu''] is not required when preceding a pro-selbri in the ''broda series''.
*Like [''goi''], [''cei''] does not always need to assign a pro-selbri of the ''broda series''.
**[lo tricu cu pu melbi cei mua mi .i lo nanmu mua mi] = The/a tree was beautiful/good-looking ''&lt;assign: mua ( = current bridi meaning = '''pu melbi''' = English: was good-looking)&gt;''  to me.  The man was &lt;reference assign: mua = pu melbi = English: was beautiful&gt; to me.
***In the immediately previous example, any occurrence of [''mua''] thereafter would mean ['''&lt;i&gt;pu&lt;/i&gt;''' ''melbi''], or &quot;''was good-looking''&quot;.  The pro-bridi keeps the same tense as the original selbri.
*Pro-bridi not only reference the relation (selbri), and therefore the Lojbanic tense of the selbri, of a bridi; but all of the sumti as well.  They do not, however, reference other participles (such as &quot;''xu''&quot;, question/true-or-false...?).  They also reference the ''meaning'' of the bridi, not the precise words.
**xu do prami mi
::.i go'i (= .i mi prami do)
***Do you love me?
:::repeat: last bridi meaning = (that-you = &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) love (that-me = &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt;) = Yes, I love you.
*Iff not edited, a pro-bridi repeats the exact same sumti, tense, etc. as the bridi being referenced (though not other participles, as per immediately preceding and above).  However, if sumti, tenses, etc. &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; specifically stated, then they replace the respective sumti, tenses, etc. of the referenced bridi.
**[mi prami la dulsinei,as. --&gt; .i la don kixoteis. (cu) pu go'i] = I love Dulcinea. --&gt; Immediately previous bridi; with rewrite (edit) of first sumti (I &lt;b&gt;--&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Don Quixote), and of tense (''unspecified'' &lt;b&gt;--&gt;&lt;/b&gt; past): Don Quixote loved Dulcinea. = I love Dulcinea.  Don Quixote loved Dulcinea.

=== go'i Within and/or Near Quotations ===

*These anaphoric words (basyvla) can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.

However, a &quot;''ri''&quot;-series or &quot;''go'a''&quot;-series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it (see example below).  Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.
**[la mark. cusku lu mi cliva le zdani li'u .i la .alksyndr. cusku lu mi go'i li'u] = Mark says, &quot;I am leaving the house.&quot;  Alexander (Alxinder) says, &quot;Me too.&quot;

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
In the previous episodes we introduced the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT). Starting from a high-level overview, we quickly created our own little scripting language called Squaak, using a Perl script provided with Parrot. We discussed the general structure of PCT-based compilers, and each of the default four transformation phases.
This third episode is where the Fun begins. In this episode, we shall introduce the full specification of Squaak. In this and following episodes, we will implement this specification step by step, in small increments that are easy to digest. Once you get a feel for it, you'll notice implementing Squaak is almost trivial, and most important, a lot of fun! So, let's get started!

==Squaak Grammar==
Without further ado, here is the full grammar specification for Squaak. This specification uses the following meta-syntax:

    statement   indicates a non-terminal, named &quot;statement&quot;
    {statement} indicates zero or more statements
    [step]      indicates an optional step
    'do'        indicates the keyword 'do'

Below is Squaak's grammar. The start symbol is program.

&lt;pre&gt;
    program              ::= {stat-or-def}

    stat-or-def          ::= statement
                           | sub-definition

    statement            ::= if-statement
                           | while-statement
                           | for-statement
                           | try-statement
                           | throw-statement
                           | variable-declaration
                           | assignment
                           | sub-call
                           | do-block

    block                ::= {statement}

    do-block             ::= 'do' block 'end'

    if-statement         ::= 'if' expression 'then' block
                             ['else' block]
                             'end'

    while-statement      ::= 'while' expression 'do'
                             block 'end'

    for-statement        ::= 'for' for-init ',' expression [step]
                             'do'
                             block
                             'end'

    step                 ::= ',' expression

    for-init             ::= 'var' identifier '=' expression

    try-statement        ::= 'try' block 'catch' identifier
                             block
                             'end'

    throw-statement      ::= 'throw' expression

    sub-definition       ::= 'sub' identifier parameters
                             block
                             'end'

    parameters           ::= '(' [identifier {',' identifier}] ')'

    variable-declaration ::= 'var' identifier ['=' expression]

    assignment           ::= primary '=' expression

    sub-call             ::= primary arguments

    primary              ::= identifier postfix-expression*

    postfix-expression   ::= key
                           | index
                           | member

    key                  ::= '{' expression '}'

    index                ::= '[' expression ']'

    member               ::= '.' identifier

    arguments            ::= '(' [expression {',' expression}] ')'

    expression           ::= expression {binary-op expression}
                           | unary-op expression
                           | '(' expression ')'
                           | term

    term                 ::= float-constant
                           | integer-constant
                           | string-constant
                           | array-constructor
                           | hash-constructor
                           | primary

    hash-constructor     ::= '{' [named-field {',' named-field}] '}'

    named-field          ::= string-constant '=&gt;' expression

    array-constructor    ::= '[' [expression {',' expression} ] ']'

    binary-op            ::= '+'  | '-'  | '/'  | '*'  | '%'  | '..'
                           | 'and | 'or' | '&gt;'  | '&gt;=' | '&lt;'  | '&lt;='
                           | '==' | '!='

    unary-op             ::= 'not' | '-'
&lt;/pre&gt;

Gee, that's a lot, isn't it? Actually, this grammar is rather small compared to &quot;real world&quot; languages such as C, not to mention Perl 6. No worries though, we won't implement the whole thing at once, but in small steps. What's more, the exercises section contains enough exercises for you to learn to use the PCT yourself! The solutions to these exercises will be posted a few days later (but you really only need a couple of hours to figure them out).

==Semantics==
Most of the Squaak language is straightforward; the if-statement executes exactly as you would expect. When we discuss a grammar rule (for its implementation), a semantic specification will be included. This is to prevent myself from writing a complete language manual, which could take some pages.

==Interactive Squaak==
Although the Squaak compiler can be used in interactive mode, there is one point of attention to be noted. When defining a local variable using the 'var' keyword, this variable will be lost in any consecutive commands. The variable will only be available to other statements within the same command (a command is a set of statements before you press enter). This has to do with the code generation by the PCT, and will be fixed at a later point. For now, just remember it doesn't work.

==Let's get started!==
In the rest of this episode we will implement the basic parts of the grammar, such as the basic data types and assignments. At the end of this episode, you'll be able to assign simple values to (global) variables. It ain't much, but it's a very important first step. Once these basics are in place, you'll notice that adding a certain syntactic construct becomes a matter of minutes.

First, open your editor and open the files &lt;code&gt;src/Squaak/Grammar.pm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;src/Squaak/Actions.pm&lt;/code&gt;. The former implements the parser using Perl 6 rules, and the latter contains the parse actions, which are executed during the parsing stage.

In the file &lt;code&gt;Grammar.pm&lt;/code&gt;, you'll see the top-level rule, named &quot;TOP&quot;. It's located at, ehm... the top. When the parser is invoked, it will start at this rule (a rule is nothing else than a method of the grammar class).

When we generated this language (in the first episode), some default rules were defined. Now we're going to make some small changes, just enough to get us started. Firstly, change the statement rule to this:

    rule statement {
        &lt;assignment&gt;
        {*}
    }

and add these rules:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule assignment {
        &lt;primary&gt; '=' &lt;expression&gt;
        {*}
    }

    rule primary {
        &lt;identifier&gt;
        {*}
    }

    token identifier {
        &lt;!keyword&gt; &lt;ident&gt;
        {*}
   }

    token keyword {
        ['and'|'catch'|'do'   |'else' |'end' |'for' |'if'
        |'not'|'or'   |'sub'  |'throw'|'try' |'var'|'while']&gt;&gt;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, change the rule &quot;value&quot; into this (renaming to &quot;expression&quot;):

    rule expression {
        | &lt;string_constant&gt; {*}        #= string_constant
        | &lt;integer_constant&gt; {*}       #= integer_constant
    }

Rename the rule &quot;integer&quot; as &quot;integer_constant&quot;, and &quot;quote&quot; as &quot;string_constant&quot; (to better match our language specification).

Phew, that was a lot of information! Let's have a closer look at some things that may look unfamiliar. The first new thing is in the rule &quot;identifier&quot;. Instead of the &quot;rule&quot; keyword, you see the keyword &quot;token&quot;. In short, a token doesn't skip whitespace between the different parts specified in the token, while a rule does. For now, it's enough to remember to use a token if you want to match a string that doesn't contain any whitespace (such as literal constants and identifiers), and use a rule if your string does (and should) contain whitespace (such as a an if-statement). We shall use the word &quot;rule&quot; in a general sense, which could refer to a token. For more information on rules and tokens (and there's a third type, called &quot;regex&quot;), take a look at synopsis 5.

In token &quot;identifier&quot;, the first subrule is called an assertion. It asserts that an &quot;identifier&quot; does not match the rule keyword. In other words, a keyword cannot be used as an identifier. The second subrule is called &quot;ident&quot;, which is a built-in rule in the class PCT::Grammar, of which this grammar is a subclass.

In token &quot;keyword&quot;, all keywords of Squaak are listed. At the end there's a &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; marker, which indicates a word boundary. Without this marker, an identifier such as &quot;forloop&quot; would wrongly be disqualified, because the part &quot;for&quot; would match the rule keyword, and the part &quot;loop&quot; would match the rule &quot;ident&quot;. However, as the assertion &lt;!keyword&gt; is false (as &quot;for&quot; could be matched), the string &quot;forloop&quot; cannot be matched as an identifier. The required presence of the word boundary prevents this.

The last rule is &quot;expression&quot;. An expression is either a string-constant or an integer-constant. Either way, an action is executed. However, when the action is executed, it does not know what the parser matched; was it a string-constant, or an integer-constant? Of course, the match object can be checked, but consider the case where you have 10 alternatives, then doing 9 checks only to find out the last alternative was matched is somewhat inefficient (and adding new alternatives requires you to update this check). That's why you see the special comments starting with a &quot;&lt;code&gt;#=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; character. Using this notation, you can specify a key, which will be passed as a second argument to the action method. As we will see, this allows us to write very simple and efficient action methods for rules such as expression. (Note there's a space between the &lt;code&gt;#=&lt;/code&gt; and the key's name).

==Testing the Parser==
It is useful to test the parser before writing any action methods. This can save you a lot of work; if you write the actions immediately after writing the grammar rules, and only later find out that your parser must be updated, then your action methods probably need to be updated as well.
In [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Poking in Compiler Guts|Episode 2]] we saw the target command line option. In order to test the parser, the &quot;parse&quot; target is especially helpful. When specifying this option, your compiler will print the parse tree of your input string, or print a syntax error. It is wise to test your parser with both correct and incorrect input, so you know for sure your parser doesn't accept input that it shouldn't.

==And... Action!==
Now we have implemented the initial version of the Squaak grammar, it's time to implement the parse actions we mentioned before. The actions are written in a file called &lt;code&gt;src/Squaak/Actions.pm&lt;/code&gt;. If you look at the methods in this file, here and there you'll see that the &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;($/)&lt;/code&gt; , or rather, hash fields of it (like &lt;code&gt;$&lt;statement&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) is evaluated in scalar context, by writing &quot;&lt;code&gt;$( ... )&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

As mentioned in Synopsis 5, evaluating a &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object in scalar context returns its result object. Normally the result object is the matched portion of the source text, but the special &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; function can be used to set the result object to some other value.

This means that each node in the parse tree (a &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object) can also hold its PAST representation. Thus we use the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; function to set the PAST representation of the current node in the parse tree, and later use the &lt;code&gt;$( ... )&lt;/code&gt; operator to retrieve the PAST representation from it.

In recap, the &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;($/)&lt;/code&gt; and any subrules of it (for instance &lt;code&gt;$&lt;statement&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) represent the parse tree; of course, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;statement&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents only the parse tree what the &lt;statement&gt; rule matched. So, any action method has access to the parse tree that the equally named grammar rule matched, as the &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object is always passed as an argument. Evaluating a parse tree in scalar context yields the PAST representation (obviously, this PAST object should be set using the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; function).

If you're following this tutorial, I highly advise you to get your feet wet, and do the exercises. Remember, learning and not doing is not learning (or something like that :-). This week's exercises are not that difficult, and after doing them, you'll have implemented the first part of our little Squaak language.

==What's next?==
In this episode we introduced the full grammar of Squaak. We took the first steps to implement this language. The first, and currently only, statement type is assignments. We briefly touched on how to write the action methods that are invoked during the parsing phase.
In the next episode, we shall take a closer look on the different PAST node types, and implement some more parts of the Squaak language. Once we have all basic parts in place, adding statement types will be rather straightforward.
In the mean time, if you have any questions or are stuck, don't hesitate to leave a comment or contact me.

==Exercises==
This episode's exercises are simple enough to get started on implementing Squaak.

Rename the names of the action methods according to the name changes we made on the grammar rules. So, &quot;integer&quot; becomes &quot;integer_constant&quot;, &quot;value&quot; becomes &quot;expression&quot;, and so on.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 2:
Look at the grammar rule for statement. A statement currently consists of an assignment. Implement the action method &quot;statement&quot; to retrieve the result object of this assignment and set it as statement's result object using the special make function. Do the same for rule primary.
;Solution:

    method statement($/) {
        make $( $&lt;assignment&gt; );
    }

Note that at this point, the rule statement doesn't define different #= keys for each type of statement, so we don't declare a parameter $key. This will be changed later.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method primary($/) {
        make $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 3:
Write the action method for the rule identifier. As a result object of this &quot;match&quot;, a new PAST::Var node should be set, taking as name a string representation of the match object ($/). For now, you can set the scope to 'package'. See &quot;pdd26: ast&quot; for details on PAST::Var nodes.
;Solution:
&lt;pre&gt;
method identifier($/) {
    make PAST::Var.new( :name(~$/),
                        :scope('package'),
                        :node($/) );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 4:
Write the action method for assignment. Retrieve the result objects for &quot;primary&quot; and for &quot;expression&quot;, and create a PAST::Op node that binds the expression to the primary. (Check out pdd26 for PAST::Op node types, and find out how you do such a binding).

;Solution:
    method assignment($/) {
        my $lhs := $( $&lt;primary&gt; );
        my $rhs := $( $&lt;expression&gt; );
        $lhs.lvalue(1);
        make PAST::Op.new( $lhs, $rhs,
                           :pasttype('bind'),
                           :node($/) );
    }

Note that we set the lvalue flag on $lhs. See PDD26 for details on this flag.

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 5:
Run your compiler on a script or in interactive mode. Use the target option to see what PIR is being generated on the input &quot;x = 42&quot;.

;Solution:

    .namespace
    .sub &quot;_block10&quot;
        new $P11, &quot;Integer&quot;
        assign $P11, 42
        set_global &quot;x&quot;, $P11
        .return ($P11)
    .end

The first two lines of code in the sub create an object to store the number 42, the third line stores this number as &quot;x&quot;. The PAST compiler will always generate an instruction to return the result of the last statement, in this case $P11.
}}

==Some Notes==

* Help! I get the error message &quot;no result object&quot;.
This means that the result object was not set properly (duh!). Make sure each action method is invoked (check each rule for a &quot;{*}&quot; marker), and that there is an action method for that rule, and that &quot;make&quot; is used to set the appropriate PAST node. Note that not all rules have action methods, for instance the &quot;keyword&quot; rule (there's no point in that).
* While we're constructing parts of Squaak's grammar, we'll sometimes make a shortcut, by forgetting about certain rules for a while. For instance, you might have noticed we're ignoring float-constants right now. That's ok. When we'll need them, these rules will be added.

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
The previous episode introduced the full grammar specification of Squaak, and we finally started working on the implementation. If you're doing the exercises, you currently have basic assignments working; strings and integers can be assigned to (global) variables. This episode will focus on implementation of some statement types and explain a few bits about the different PAST node types.

==Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree==
A '''Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree (PAST)''' represents a program written in Squaak (or any other Parrot-ported language), and consists of nodes. In the previous episode, we already saw nodes to represent string and integer literals, identifiers and &quot;operator&quot; nodes (&lt;code&gt;PAST::Op&lt;/code&gt;), in our case assignment.

Other operators represent other high-level language constructs such as conditional statements, loops, and subroutine invocation. Depending on the node type, a PAST node can take '''child nodes'''. For instance, a PAST node to represent an if-statement can have up to three child nodes. The first child node represents the condition; if true, the second child node is evaluated. If the condition evaluates to false, and there's a third child node, this third child node is evaluated (the else part).

If the PAST represents a subroutine invocation, the child nodes are evaluated in a ''different'' way. In that case, the first child node represents the subroutine that is to be invoked (unless the &lt;code&gt;:name&lt;/code&gt; attribute was set on this node, but more on that in a later episode), and all other child nodes are passed to that subroutine as arguments.

It generally doesn't matter of which PAST node type the children are. For instance, consider a language in which a simple expression is a statement:

    42

You might wonder what kind of code is generated for this. Well, it's really very simple: a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Val&lt;/code&gt; node is created (of a certain type, for this example that would be '&lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;'), and the value is assigned to this node. It might seem a bit confusing to write something like this, as it doesn't really do anything (note that this is not valid Squaak input):

    if 42 then &quot;hi&quot; else &quot;bye&quot; end

But again, this works out correctly; the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; blocks are compiled to instructions that load that particular literal into a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Val&lt;/code&gt; node and leave it there. That's fine, if your language allows such statements.

The point I'm trying to make is, that all PAST nodes are equal. You don't need to think about the node types if you set a node as a child of some other parent node. Each PAST node is compiled into a number of PIR instructions.

==Go with the control-flow==
Now you know a bit more on PAST nodes, let's get our hands dirty and implement some more statement types. In the rest of this episode, we'll handle if-statements and throw-statements.

===If-then-else===
The first statement we're going to implement now is the if-statement. An if-statement has typically three parts (but this of course depends on the programming language): a conditional expression, a &quot;then&quot; part and an &quot;else&quot; part. Implementing this in Perl 6 rules and PAST is almost trivial:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule if_statement {
        'if' &lt;expression&gt; 'then' &lt;block&gt;
        ['else' $&lt;else&gt;=&lt;block&gt; ]?
        'end'
        {*}
    }

    rule block {
        &lt;statement&gt;*
        {*}
    }

    rule statement {
        | &lt;assignment&gt; {*}          #= assignment
        | &lt;if_statement&gt; {*}        #= if_statement
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the optional &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block is stored in the match object's &quot;&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;&quot; field. If we hadn't written this &lt;code&gt;$&lt;else&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; part, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;block&gt;&lt;/code&gt; would have been an array, with &lt;code&gt;block[0]&lt;/code&gt; the &quot;&lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;&quot; part, and &lt;code&gt;block[1]&lt;/code&gt; the optional &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; part. Assigning the optional &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block to a different field, makes the action method slightly easier to read.

Also note that the statement rule has been updated; a statement is now either an assignment or an if-statement. As a result, the action method statement now takes a key argument. The relevant action methods are shown below:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    method statement($/, $key) {
        # get the field stored in $key from the $/ object,
        # and retrieve the result object from that field.
        make $( $/{$key} );
    }

    method block($/) {
        # create a new block, set its type to 'immediate',
        # meaning it is potentially executed immediately
        # (as opposed to a declaration, such as a
        # subroutine definition).
        my $past := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype('immediate'),
                                     :node($/) );

        # for each statement, add the result
        # object to the block
        for $&lt;statement&gt; {
            $past.push( $( $_ ) );
        }
        make $past;
    }

    method if_statement($/) {
        my $cond := $( $&lt;expression&gt; );
        my $then := $( $&lt;block&gt; );
        my $past := PAST::Op.new( $cond, $then,
                                  :pasttype('if'),
                                  :node($/) );
        if $&lt;else&gt; {
            $past.push( $( $&lt;else&gt;[0] ) );
        }
        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

That's, easy, huh? First, we get the result objects for the conditional expression and the then part. Then, a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op&lt;/code&gt; node is created, and the &lt;code&gt;:pasttype&lt;/code&gt; is set to 'if', meaning this node represents an if-statement. Then, if there is an &quot;else&quot; block, this block's result object is retrieved and added as the third child of the PAST node. Finally, the result object is set with the make function.

=== Result objects ===

At this point it's wise to spend a few words on the '''&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;''' function, the parse actions and how the whole PAST is created by the individual parse actions. Have another look at the action method if_statement. In the first two lines, we request the result objects for the conditional expression and the &quot;then&quot; block. When were these result objects created? How can we be sure they're there?
The answer lies in the order in which the parse actions are executed. The special '''&lt;code&gt;{*}&lt;/code&gt;''' symbol that triggers a '''parse action invocation''', is usually placed at the end of the &lt;code&gt;rule&lt;/code&gt;. For this input string: &quot;&lt;code&gt;if 42 then x = 1 end&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this implies the following order:

# parse TOP
# parse statement
# parse if_statement
# parse expression
# parse integer
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Val( :value(42) )&lt;/code&gt;
# parse block
# parse statement
# parse assignment
# parse identifier
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Var( :name('x'))&lt;/code&gt;
# parse integer
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Val( :value(1) )&lt;/code&gt;
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op( :pasttype('bind') )&lt;/code&gt;
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; (in action method block)
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op( :pasttype('if') )&lt;/code&gt;
# create &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; (in action method TOP)

As you can see, PAST nodes are created in the leafs of the parse tree first, so that later, action methods higher in the parse tree can retrieve them.

===Throwing Exceptions===
The grammar rule for the &quot;throw&quot; statement is really quite easy, but it's useful to discuss the parse action, as it shows the use of generating custom PIR instructions. First the grammar rule:

    rule throw_statement {
        'throw' &lt;expression&gt;
        {*}
    }

I assume you know how to update the &quot;statement&quot; rule by now. The throw statement will compile down to Parrot's &quot;throw&quot; instruction, which takes one argument. In order to generate a custom Parrot instruction, the instruction can be specified in the :pirop attribute when creating a PAST::Op node. Any child nodes are passed as arguments to this instruction, so we need to pass the result object of the expression being thrown as a child of the PAST::Op node representing the &quot;throw&quot; instruction.

    method throw_statement($/) {
        make PAST::Op.new( $( $&lt;expression&gt; ),
                           :pirop('throw'),
                           :node($/) );
    }


==What's Next?==
In this episode we implemented two more statement types of Squaak. You should get a general idea of how and when PAST nodes are created, and how they can be retrieved sub (parse) trees. In the next episode we'll take a closer look at variable scope and subroutines.

In the mean time, I can imagine some things are not too clear. In case you're lost, don't hesitate to leave comment, and I'll try to answer (as far as my knowledge goes).

==Exercises==

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 1:
We showed how the if-statement was implemented. The while-statement and try-statement are very similar. Implement these. Check out pdd26 to see what &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op&lt;/code&gt; nodes you should create.

;Solution:

The while-statement is straightforward:

    method while_statement($/) {
        my $cond := $( $&lt;expression&gt; );
        my $body := $( $&lt;block&gt; );
        make PAST::Op.new( $cond, $body,
                           :pasttype('while'),
                           :node($/) );
    }

The try-statement is a bit more complex. Here are the grammar rules and action methods.
&lt;pre&gt;
    rule try_statement {
        'try' $&lt;try&gt;=&lt;block&gt;
        'catch' &lt;exception&gt;
        $&lt;catch&gt;=&lt;block&gt;
       'end'
        {*}
    }

    rule exception {
        &lt;identifier&gt;
        {*}
    }

    method try_statement($/) {
        ## get the try block
        my $try := $( $&lt;try&gt; );

        ## create a new PAST::Stmts node for
        ## the catch block; note that no
        ## PAST::Block is created, as this
        ## currently has problems with the
        ## exception object. For now this will
        ## do.
        my $catch := PAST::Stmts.new( :node($/) );
        $catch.push( $( $&lt;catch&gt; ) );

        ## get the exception identifier;
        ## set a declaration flag, the scope,
        ## and clear the viviself attribute.
        my $exc := $( $&lt;exception&gt; );
        $exc.isdecl(1);
        $exc.scope('lexical');
        $exc.viviself(0);

        ## generate instruction to retrieve
        ## the exception objct (and the
        ## exception message, that is passed
        ## automatically in PIR, this is stored
        ## into $S0 (but not used).
        my $pir := &quot;    .get_results (%r, $S0)\n&quot;
                 ~ &quot;    store_lex '&quot; ~ $exc.name()
                 ~ &quot;', %r&quot;;

        $catch.unshift( PAST::Op.new(
                          :inline($pir),
                          :node($/) ) );

        ## do the declaration of the exception
        ## object as a lexical here:
        $catch.unshift( $exc );

        make PAST::Op.new( $try, $catch,
                           :pasttype('try'),
                           :node($/) );
    }

    method exception($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        my $past := $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );
        $?BLOCK.symbol( $past.name(), :scope('lexical') );
        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Instead of putting &quot;&lt;code&gt;identifier&lt;/code&gt;&quot; after the &quot;&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;&quot; keyword, we made it a separate rule, with its own action method. This allows us to insert the identifier into the symbol table of the current block (the try-block), before the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block is parsed.

First the PAST node for the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block is retrieved. Then, the catch block is retrieved, and stored into a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Stmts&lt;/code&gt; node. This is needed, so that we can make sure that the instructions that retrieve the exception object come first in the exception handler.

Then, we retrieve the PAST node for the exception identifier. We're setting its scope, a flag telling the PAST compiler this is a declaration, and we clear the '''&lt;code&gt;viviself&lt;/code&gt; attribute'''. The &lt;code&gt;viviself&lt;/code&gt; attribute is discussed in a later episode; if you didn't read that yet, just keep in mind the &lt;code&gt;viviself&lt;/code&gt; attribute (if set) will make sure all declared variables are initialized. We must clear this attribute here, to make sure that this exception object is ''not'' initialized, because that will be done by the instruction that retrieves the thrown exception object, discussed next.

In PIR, we can use the &lt;code&gt;.get_results&lt;/code&gt; directive to retrieve a thrown exception. You could also generate the &lt;code&gt;get_results&lt;/code&gt; instruction (note the missing dot), but this is much easier. Currently, in PIR, when retrieving the exception object, you must always specify both a variable (or register) for the exception object, and a string variable (or register) to store the exception message. The exception message is actually stored within the exception object. We use &lt;code&gt;$S0&lt;/code&gt; to store the exception message, and we'll ignore it after that. Just remember for now that if you want to retrieve the exception object, you must also specify a place to store the exception message.
There is no special PAST node to generate these instructions, so we use a so-called inline &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op&lt;/code&gt; node. We store the instructions to be generated into a string and store that in the '''&lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; attribute''' of a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op&lt;/code&gt; node. Once created, this node is &lt;code&gt;unshift&lt;/code&gt;ed onto the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Stmts&lt;/code&gt; node representing the exception handler. After that, the declaration is stored in that &lt;code&gt;PAST::Stmts&lt;/code&gt; node, so that this declaration comes first.

Finally, we have the block representing the try block, and a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Stmts&lt;/code&gt; node representing the exception handler. Both are used to create a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op&lt;/code&gt; node whose &lt;code&gt;pasttype&lt;/code&gt; is set to the built-in &quot;&lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;&quot; type.

;Problem 2:
Start Squaak in interactive mode, and specify the target option to show the generated PIR instructions. Check out what instructions and labels are generated, and see if you can recognize which instructions make up the conditional expression, which represent the &quot;then&quot; block, and which represent the &quot;else&quot; block (if any).

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
[[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/PAST Nodes and More Statements|Episode 4]] discussed the implementation of some statement types, such as the if-statement. In this episode we'll talk about variable declarations and scope handling. It's going to be a long story, so take your time to read this episode.

==Globals, locals and default values==
Squaak variables have one of two scopes: either they're '''global''', or they're '''local'''. In order to create a global variable, you just assign some expression to an identifier (which hasn't been declared as a local). Local variables, on the other hand, must be declared using the '''&lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword. In other words, at any given point during the parsing phase, we have a list of variables that are known to be local variables. When an identifier is parsed, it is looked up and if found, its scope is set to local. If not, its scope is assumed to be global. When using an uninitialized variable, its value is set to an object called '''&lt;code&gt;Undef&lt;/code&gt;'''. Some examples are shown below.

    x = 42             # x was not declared, so it is global
    var k = 10         # k is local and initialized to 10
    a + b              # neither a nor b was declared;         
                       # both default to the value &quot;Undef&quot;

==Scoping and Symbol Tables==
Earlier we mentioned the need to store declared local variables. In compiler jargon, such a data structure to store declarations is called a '''symbol table'''. For each individual scope, there's a separate symbol table.

Squaak has a so-called do-block statement, that is defined below.

    rule do_block {
        'do' &lt;block&gt; 'end'
        {*}
    }

Each do-block defines a new scope; local variables declared between the &quot;&lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&quot; keywords are local to that block. An example to clarify this is shown below:

    do
      var x = 1
      print(x)      # prints 1
    
      do
        var x = 2
        print(x)    # prints 2
      end
    
      print(x)      # prints 1
    end

So, each do/end pair defines a new scope, in which any declared variables hide variables with the same name in outer scopes. This behavior is common in many programming languages.
The PCT has built-in support for symbol tables; a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; object has a method '''&lt;code&gt;symbol&lt;/code&gt;''' that can be used to enter new symbols and query the table for existing ones.
In PCT, a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; object represents a scope. There are two &lt;code&gt;blocktype&lt;/code&gt;s: '''&lt;code&gt;immediate&lt;/code&gt;''' and '''&lt;code&gt;declaration&lt;/code&gt;'''. An &lt;code&gt;immediate&lt;/code&gt; block can be used to represent the blocks of statements in an do-block statement, for instance:

    do  
      block 
    end

When executing this statement, block is executed immediately. A &lt;code&gt;declaration&lt;/code&gt; block, on the other hand, represents a block of statements that can be invoked at a later point. Typically these are subroutines. So, in this example:

    sub foo(x)
      print(x)
    end

a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; object is created for the subroutine &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;blocktype&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;declaration&lt;/code&gt;, as the subroutine is defined, not executed (immediately). For now you can forget about the &lt;code&gt;blocktype&lt;/code&gt;, but now that I've told you, you'll recognize it when you see it. We'll come back to it in a later episode.

==Implementing Scope==
So, we know how to use global variables, declare local variables, and about &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; objects representing scopes. How do we make our compiler to generate the right PIR instructions? After all, when handling a global variable, Parrot must handle this differently from handling a local variable.
When creating &lt;code&gt;PAST::Var&lt;/code&gt; nodes to represent the variables, we must know whether the variable is a local or a global variable. So, when handling variable declarations (of local variables; globals are not declared), we need to register the identifier as a local in the current block's symbol table. First, we'll take a look at the implementation of variable declarations.

==Variable declaration==
The following is the grammar rule for variable declarations. This is a type of statement, so I assume you know how to extend the statement rule to allow for variable declarations.

    rule variable_declaration {
        'var' &lt;identifier&gt; ['=' &lt;expression&gt;]?
        {*}
    }

A local variable is declared using the '''&lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword, and has an optional initialization expression. If the latter is missing, the variable's value defaults to the undefined value called '''&lt;code&gt;Undef&lt;/code&gt;'''. Let's see what the parse action looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
    method variable_declaration($/) {
        # get the PAST for the identifier
        my $past := $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );

        # this is a local (it's being defined)
        $past.scope('lexical');

        # set a declaration flag
        $past.isdecl(1);

        # check for the initialization expression
        if $&lt;expression&gt; {
            # use the viviself clause to add a
            # an initialization expression
            $past.viviself( $($&lt;expression&gt;[0]) );
        }
        else { # no initialization, default to &quot;Undef&quot;
            $past.viviself('Undef');
        }
        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Well, that wasn't too hard, was it? Let's analyze what we just did. First we retrieved the PAST node for the identifier, which we then decorated by setting its scope to &lt;code&gt;lexical&lt;/code&gt; (a local variable is said to be [[wikipedia:Scope (programming)#Static versus dynamic scoping|lexically scoped]], hence '''&lt;code&gt;lexical&lt;/code&gt;'''), and setting a flag indicating this node represents a declaration (&lt;code&gt;isdecl&lt;/code&gt;). So, besides representing variables in other statements (for instance, assignments), a '''&lt;code&gt;PAST::Var&lt;/code&gt;''' node is also used as a declaration statement.

Earlier in this episode we mentioned the need to register local variables in the current scope block when they are declared. So, when executing the parse action for variable-declaration, there should already be a '''&lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt;''' node around, that can be used to register the symbol being declared. As we learned in [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/PAST Nodes and More Statements|Episode 4]], PAST nodes are created in a depth-first fashion; the leafs are created first, and then the nodes &quot;higher&quot; in the parse tree. This implies that a '''&lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt;''' node is created after the statement nodes (which '''&lt;code&gt;variable_declaration&lt;/code&gt;''' is) that will be the children of the block. In the next section we'll see how to solve this problem.

==Implementing a scope stack==
In order to make sure that a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node is created before any statements are parsed (and their parse actions are executed -- these might need to enter symbols in the block's symbol table), we add a few extra parse actions. Let's take a look at them.

    rule TOP {
        {*}                              #= open
        &lt;statement&gt;*
        [ $ || &lt;.panic: syntax error&gt; ]
        {*}                              #= close
    }

We now have two parse actions for &lt;code&gt;TOP&lt;/code&gt;, which are differentiated by an additional key parameter. The first parse action is executed before any input is parsed, which is particularly suitable for any initialization actions you might need. The second action (which was already there) is executed after the whole input string is parsed. Now we can create a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node before any statements are parsed, so that when we need the current block, it's there (somewhere, later we'll see where exactly). Let's take a look at the parse action for &lt;code&gt;TOP&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method TOP($/, $key) {
       our $?BLOCK;
       our @?BLOCK;

       if $key eq 'open' {
          $?BLOCK := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype('declaration'),
                                      :node($/) );
          @?BLOCK.unshift($?BLOCK);
       }
       else { # key is 'close'
          my $past := @?BLOCK.shift();

          for $&lt;statement&gt; {
             $past.push( $( $_ ) );
          }
          make $past;
       }
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's see what's happening here. When the parse action is invoked for the first time (when &lt;code&gt;$key&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;&quot;open&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node is created and assigned to a strange-looking (if you don't know Perl, like me. Oh wait, this is Perl. Never mind..) variable called &lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;. This variable is declared as &quot;&lt;code&gt;our&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, which means that it is a '''package variable'''. This means that the variable is shared by all methods in the same package (or class), and, equally important, the variable is still around after the parse action is done. Please refer to the [http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html#Names Perl 6 specification] for more semantics on &quot;our&quot;. The variable &lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt; holds the current block.
After that, this block is unshifted onto another funny-looking variable, called &lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;. This variable has a &quot;@&quot; sigil, meaning this is an array. The &lt;code&gt;unshift&lt;/code&gt; method puts its argument on the front of the list. In a sense, you could think of the front of this list as the top of a stack. Later we'll see why this stack is necessary.

This &lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt; variable is also declared with &quot;&lt;code&gt;our&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, meaning it's also package-scoped. However, as we call a method on this variable, it should have been already created; otherwise you'd invoke the method on an undefined (&quot;Undef&quot;) variable. So, this variable should have been created before the parsing starts. We can do this in the compiler's main program, &lt;code&gt;squaak.pir&lt;/code&gt;.
Before doing so, let's take a quick look at the &quot;&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;&quot; part of the parse action for &lt;code&gt;TOP&lt;/code&gt;, which is executed after the whole input string is parsed. The &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node is retrieved from &lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;, which makes sense, as it was created in the first part of the method and unshifted on &lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;. Now this node can be used as the final result object of &lt;code&gt;TOP&lt;/code&gt;. So, now we've seen how to use the scope stack, let's have a look at its implementation.

==A List Class==
We'll implement the scope stack as a ResizablePMCArray object. This is a built-in PMC type. However, this built-in PMC does not have any methods; in PIR it can only be used as an operand of the built-in shift and unshift instructions. In order to allow us to write this as method calls, we create a new subclass of ResizablePMCArray. The code below creates the new class and defines the methods we need.

     1 .namespace
     2 .sub 'initlist' :anon :init :load
     3   subclass $P0, 'ResizablePMCArray', 'List'
     4   new $P1, 'List'
     5   set_hll_global ['Squaak';'Grammar';'Actions'], '@?BLOCK', $P1
     6 .end
     7 .namespace ['List']
     8 .sub 'unshift' :method
     9   .param pmc obj
    10   unshift self, obj
    11 .end
    12 .sub 'shift' :method
    13   shift $P0, self
    14   .return ($P0)
    15 .end

Well, here you have it: part of the small amount of PIR code you need to write for the Squaak compiler (there's some more for some built-in subroutines, more on that later). Let's discuss this code snippet in more detail (if you know PIR, you could skip this section).
Line 1 resets the namespace to the root namespace in Parrot, so that the sub &lt;code&gt;'initlist'&lt;/code&gt; is stored in that namespace. The sub &lt;code&gt;'initlist'&lt;/code&gt; defined in lines 2-6 has some flags: &lt;code&gt;:anon&lt;/code&gt; means that the sub is not stored by name in the namespace, implying it cannot be looked up by name. The &lt;code&gt;:init&lt;/code&gt; flag means that the sub is executed before the main program (the &quot;main&quot; sub) is executed. The &lt;code&gt;:load&lt;/code&gt; flag makes sure that the sub is executed if this file was compiled and loaded by another file through the &lt;code&gt;load_bytecode&lt;/code&gt; instruction. If you don't understand this, no worries. You can forget about it now. In any case, we know for sure there's a List class when we need it, because the class creation is done before running the actual compiler code.

Line 3 creates a new subclass of ResizablePMCArray, called &quot;List&quot;. This results in a new class object, which is left in register &lt;code&gt;$P0&lt;/code&gt;, but it's not used after that.
Line 4 creates a new List object, and stores it in register &lt;code&gt;$P1&lt;/code&gt;. Line 5, stores this List object by name of &quot;&lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (that name should ring a bell now...) in the namespace of the Actions class. The semicolons in between the several key strings indicate nested namespaces. So, lines 4 and 5 are important, because the create the &lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt; variable and store it in a place that can be accessed from the action methods in the Actions class.

Lines 7-11 define the unshift method, which is a method in the &quot;List&quot; namespace. This means that it can be invoked as a method on a List object. As the sub is marked with the &lt;code&gt;:method&lt;/code&gt; flag, the sub has an implicit first parameter called &quot;self&quot;, which refers to the invocant object. The unshift method invokes Parrot's unshift instruction on self, passing the obj argument as the second operand. So, obj is unshifted onto self, which is the List object itself.

Finally, lines 12-15 define the &quot;shift&quot; method, which does the opposite of &quot;unshift&quot;, removing the first element and returning it to its caller.

==Storing Symbols==
Now, we set up the necessary infrastructure to store the current scope block, and we created a datastructure that acts as a scope stack, which we will need later. We'll now go back to the parse action for variable_declaration, because we didn't enter the declared variable into the current block's symbol table yet. We'll see how to do that now.
First, we need to make the current block accessible from the method variable_declaration. We've already seen how to do that, using the &quot;our&quot; keyword. It doesn't really matter where in the action method we enter the symbol's name into the symbol table, but let's do it at the end, after the initialization stuff. Naturally, we're only going to enter the symbol if it's not there already; duplicate variable declarations (in the same scope) should result in an error message (using the panic method of the match object).
The code to be added to the method variable_declaration looks then like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
    method variable_declaration($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;

        # get the PAST node for identifier

        # set the scope and declaration flag

        # do the initialization stuff

        # cache the name into a local variable
        my $name := $past.name();

        if $?BLOCK.symbol( $name ) {
          # symbol is already present
          $/.panic(&quot;Error: symbol &quot; ~ $name
                   ~ &quot; was already defined.\n&quot;);
        }
        else {
          $?BLOCK.symbol( $name, :scope('lexical') );
        }

        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

==What's Next?==
With this code in place, variable declarations are handled correctly. However, we didn't update the parse action for identifier, which creates the PAST::Var node and sets its scope; currently all identifiers' scope is set to 'package' (which means it's a global variable). As we already covered a lot of material in this episode, we'll leave this for the next episode. In the next episode, we'll also cover subroutines, which is another important aspect of any programming language. Hope to catch you later!

==Exercises==

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 1:
In this episode, we changed the action method for the TOP rule; it is now invoked twice, once at the beginning of the parse, once at the end of the parse. The block rule, which defines a block to be a series of statements, represents a new scope. This rule is used in for instance if-statement (the then-part and else-part), while-statement (the loop body) and others. Update the parse action for block so it is invoked twice; once before parsing the statements, during which a new PAST::Block is created and stored onto the scope stack, and once after parsing the statements, during which this PAST node is set as the result object. Make sure &lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt; is always pointing to the current block. In order to do this exercise correctly, you should understand well what the shift and unshift methods do, and why we didn't implement methods to push and pop, which are more appropriate words in the context of a (scope) stack.

;Solution:
'''Keeping the Current block up to date''': Sometimes we need to access the current block's symbol table. In order to be able to do so, we need a reference to the &quot;current block&quot;. We do this by declaring a package variable called &quot;&lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, declared with &quot;our&quot; (as opposed with &quot;my&quot;). This variable will always point to the &quot;current&quot; block. As blocks can nest, we use a &quot;stack&quot;, on which newly created blocks are stored.

Whenever a new block is created, we assign this to &lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;, and store it onto the stack, so that the next time a new block is created, the &quot;old&quot; current block isn't lost. Whenever a scope is closed, we pop off the current block from the stack, and restore the previous &quot;current&quot; block.

'''Why unshift/shift and not push/pop?''': When we're talking about stacks, it would seem logical to talk about stack operations such as &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pop&quot;. Instead, we use the operations &quot;unshift&quot; and &quot;shift&quot;. If you're not a Perl programmer (such as myself), these names might not make sense. However, it's pretty easy. Instead of pushing a new object onto the &quot;top&quot; of the stack, you unshift objects onto this stack. Just see it as an old school bus, with only one entrance (at the front of the bus). Pushing a new person means taking the first free seat when entering, while unshifting a new person means everybody moves (shifts) one place to the back, so the new person can sit in the front seat. You might think this is not as efficient (more stuff is moved around), but that's not really true (actually: I guess (and certainly hope) the shift and unshift operations are implemented more effectively than the bus metaphor; I don't know how it is implemented).

So why unshift/shift, and not push/pop? When restoring the previous &quot;current block&quot;, we need to know exactly where it is (what position). It would be nice to be able to always refer to the &quot;first passenger on the bus&quot;, instead of the last person. We know how to reference the first passenger (it's on seat no. 0 (it was designed by an IT guy)); we don't really know what is the seat no. of the last person: s/he might sit in the middle, or at the back.

I hope it's clear what I mean here... otherwise, have a look at the code, and try to figure out what's happening:

&lt;pre&gt;
    method block($/, $key) {  
      our $?BLOCK;
      our @?BLOCK;
      if $key eq 'open' {
            $?BLOCK := PAST::Block.new(
                        :blocktype('immediate'), 
                          :node($/) );
           @?BLOCK.unshift($?BLOCK);
        }
        else {
            my $past := @?BLOCK.shift();
            $?BLOCK  := @?BLOCK[0];

            for $&lt;statement&gt; {
                $past.push( $( $_ ) );
            }
            make $past;
        }
    } 
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
In [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Variable Declaration and Scope|Episode 5]], we looked at variable declarations and implementing scope. We covered a lot of information then, but did not tell the full story, in order to keep that post short. In this episode we'll address the missing parts, which will also result in implementing subroutines.

==Variables==
In the previous episode, we entered local variables into the current block's symbol table. As we've seen earlier, using the do-block statement, scopes may nest. Consider this example:

    do
       var x = 42
       do
          print(x)
       end
    end

In this example, the print statement should print 42, even though x was not declared in the scope where it is referenced. How does the compiler know it's still a local variable? That's simple: it should look in all scopes, starting at the innermost scope. Only when the variable is found in any scope, should its scope be set to &quot;lexical&quot;, so that the right instructions are being generated.

The solution I came up with is shown below. Please note that I'm not 100% sure if this is the &quot;best&quot; solution, but my personal understanding of the PAST compiler is limited. So, while this solution works, I may teach you the wrong &quot;habit&quot;. Please be aware of this.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method identifier($/) {
        our @?BLOCK;

        my $name  := ~$&lt;ident&gt;;
        my $scope := 'package'; # default value

        # go through all scopes and check if the symbol
        # is registered as a local. If so, set scope to
        # local.
        for @?BLOCK {
            if $_.symbol($name) {
                $scope := 'lexical';
            }
        }

        make PAST::Var.new( :name($name),
                            :scope($scope),
                            :viviself('Undef'),
                            :node($/) );
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Viviself==
You might have noticed the viviself attribute before. This attribute will result in extra instructions that will initialize the variable if it doesn't exist. As you know, global variables spring into life automatically when they're used. Earlier we mentioned that uninitialized variables have a default value of &quot;Undef&quot;: the viviself attribute does this.
For local variables, we use this mechanism to set the (optional) initialization value. When the identifier is a parameter, the parameter will be initialized automatically if it doesn't receive a value when the subroutine it belongs to is invoked. Effectively this means that all parameters in Squaak are optional!

==Subroutines==
We already mentioned subroutines before, and introduced the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node type. We also briefly mentioned the &lt;code&gt;blocktype&lt;/code&gt; attribute that can be set on a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node, which indicates whether the block is to be executed immediately (for instance, a do-block or if statement) or it represents a declaration (for instance, subroutines). Let us now look at the grammar rule for subroutine definitions:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule sub_definition {
        'sub' &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;parameters&gt;
        &lt;statement&gt;*
        'end'
        {*}
    }

    rule parameters {
        '(' [&lt;identifier&gt; [',' &lt;identifier&gt;]* ]? ')'
        {*}
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is rather straightforward, and the action methods for these rules are quite simple, as you will see. First, however, let's have a look at the rule for sub definitions. Why is the sub body defined as &lt;code&gt;&lt;statement&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and not as a &lt;code&gt;&lt;block&gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Surely, a subroutine defines a new scope, which was already covered by &lt;block&gt; Well, you're right in that. However, as we will see, by the time that a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node would be created, we are too late! The parameters would already have been parsed, and not entered into the block's symbol table. That's a problem, because parameters are most likely to be used in the subroutine's body, and as they are not registered as local variables (which they are), any usage of parameters would not be compiled down to the right instructions to fetch any parameters.

So, how do we solve this in an efficient way?

The solution is simple. The only place where parameters live, is in the subroutine's body, represented by a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node. Why don't we create the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node in the action method for the &lt;code&gt;parameters&lt;/code&gt; rule. By doing so, the block is already in place and the parameters are registered as local symbols right in time. Let's look at the action methods.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method parameters($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        our @?BLOCK;

        my $past := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype('declaration'),
                                     :node($/) );

        # now add all parameters to this block
        for $&lt;identifier&gt; {
            my $param := $( $_ );
            $param.scope('parameter');
            $past.push($param);

            # register the parameter as a local symbol
            $past.symbol($param.name(), :scope('lexical'));
        }

        # now put the block into place on the scope stack
        $?BLOCK := $past;
        @?BLOCK.unshift($past);

        make $past;
    }

    method sub_definition($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        our @?BLOCK;

        my $past := $( $&lt;parameters&gt; );
        my $name := $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );

        # set the sub's name
        $past.name( $name.name() );

        # add all statements to the sub's body
        for $&lt;statement&gt; {
            $past.push( $( $_ ) );
        }

        # and remove the block from the scope
        # stack and restore the current block
        @?BLOCK.shift();
        $?BLOCK := @?BLOCK[0];

        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, let's check out the parse action for parameters. First, a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node is created. Then, we iterate over the list of identifiers (which may be empty), each representing a parameter. After retrieving the result object for a parameter (which is just an identifier), we set its scope to &quot;parameter&quot;, and we add it to the block object. After that, we register the parameter as a symbol in the block object, specifying the scope as &quot;lexical&quot;. Parameters are just a special kind of local variables, and there's no difference in a parameter and a declared local variable in a subroutine, except that a parameter will usually be initialized with a value that is passed when the subroutine is invoked.

After handling the parameters, we set the current block (referred to by our package variable &lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;) to the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node we just created, and push it on the scope stack (referred to by our package variable &lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;).

After the whole subroutine definition is parsed, the action method &lt;code&gt;sub_definition&lt;/code&gt; is invoked. This will retrieve the result object for parameters, which is the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node that will represent the sub. After retrieving the result object for the sub's name, we set the name on the block node, and add all statements to the block. After this, we pop off this block node of the scope stack (&lt;code&gt;@?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;), and restore the current block (&lt;code&gt;$?BLOCK&lt;/code&gt;).

Pretty easy, huh?

==Subroutine invocation==
Once you defined a subroutine, you'll want to invoke it. In the exercises of [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Variable Declaration and Scope|Episode 5]], we already gave some tips on how to create the PAST nodes for a subroutine invocation. In this section, we'll give a complete description. First we'll introduce the grammar rules.

    rule sub_call {
        &lt;primary&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;
        {*}
    }

Not only allows this to invoke subroutines by their name, you can also store the subroutines in an array or hash field, and invoke them from there. Let's take a look at the action method, which is really quite straightforward.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method sub_call($/) {
        my $invocant := $( $&lt;primary&gt; );
        my $past     := $( $&lt;arguments&gt; );
        $past.unshift($invocant);
        make $past;
    }

    method arguments($/) {
        my $past := PAST::Op.new( :pasttype('call'), :node($/) );
        for $&lt;expression&gt; {
            $past.push( $( $_ ) );
        }
        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

The result object of the sub_call method should be a PAST::Op node (of type 'call'), which contains a number of child nodes: the first one is the invocant object, and all remaining children are the arguments to that sub call.

In order to &quot;move&quot; the result objects of the arguments to the &lt;code&gt;sub_call&lt;/code&gt; method, we create the PAST::Op node in the method arguments, which is then retrieved by &lt;code&gt;sub_call&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;sub_call&lt;/code&gt;, the invocant object is set as the first child (using unshift). This is all too easy, isn't it? :-)

==What's Next?==
In this episode we finished the implementation of scope in Squaak, and implemented subroutines. Our language is coming along nicely! In the next episode, we'll explore how to implement operators and an operator precedence table for efficient expression parsing.

In the mean time, should you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment!

==Exercises==

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 1:

By now you should have a good idea on the implementation of scope in Squaak. We haven't implemented the for-statement yet, as it needs proper scope handling to implement. Implement this. Check out episode 3 for the BNF rules that define the syntax of the for-statement. When implementing it, you will run into the same issue as we did when implementing subroutines and parameters. Use the same trick for the implementation of the for-statement.

;Solution:

First, let us look at the BNF of the for-statement:

&lt;pre&gt;
    for-statement ::= 'for' for-init ',' expression [step]
                      'do'
                      block
                      'end'

    step          ::= ',' expression

    for-init      ::= 'var' identifier '=' expression
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's pretty easy to convert this to Perl 6 rules:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule for_statement {
        'for' &lt;for_init&gt; ',' &lt;expression&gt; &lt;step&gt;?
        'do' &lt;block&gt; 'end'
        {*}
    }

    rule step {
        ',' &lt;expression&gt;
        {*}
    }

    rule for_init {
        'var' &lt;identifier&gt; '=' &lt;expression&gt;
        {*}
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Pretty easy huh? Let's take a look at the semantics. A for-loop is just another way to write a while loop, but much easier in certain cases. This:

&lt;pre&gt;
    for var &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;expr1&gt;, &lt;expr2&gt;, &lt;expr3&gt; do
    &lt;block&gt;
    end
&lt;/pre&gt;

corresponds to:

    do
        var &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;expr1&gt;
        while &lt;ident&gt; &lt;= &lt;expr2&gt; do
            &lt;block&gt;
            &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;ident&gt; + &lt;expr3&gt;
        end
    end

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;expr3&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is absent, it defaults to the value &quot;1&quot;. Note that the step expression (&lt;code&gt;expr3&lt;/code&gt;) should be positive; the loop condition contains a &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator. When you specify a negative step expression, the loop variable will only decrease in value, which will never make the loop condition false (unless it overflows, but that's a different issue; this might even raise an exception in Parrot; this I do not know). Allowing negative step expressions introduces more complexity, which I felt was not worth the trouble for this tutorial language.

Note that the loop variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;ident&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is local to the for loop; this is expressed in the equivalent while loop by the surrounding do/end pair: a new do/end pair defines a new (nested) scope; after the &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; keyword, the loop variable is no longer visible.

Let's implement the action method for the for-statement. As was mentioned in the exercise description, we're dealing with the same situation as with subroutine parameters. In this case, we're dealing with the loop variable, which is local to the for-statement. Let's check out the rule for &lt;code&gt;for_init&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
    method for_init($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        our @?BLOCK;

        ## create a new scope here, so that we can
        ## add the loop variable
        ## to this block here, which is convenient.
        $?BLOCK := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype('immediate'),
                                    :node($/) );
        @?BLOCK.unshift($?BLOCK);

        my $iter := $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );
        ## set a flag that this identifier is being declared
        $iter.isdecl(1);
        $iter.scope('lexical');
        ## the identifier is initialized with this expression
        $iter.viviself( $( $&lt;expression&gt; ) );

        ## enter the loop variable into the symbol table.
        $?BLOCK.symbol($iter.name(), :scope('lexical'));

        make $iter;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, just as we created a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; for the subroutine in the action method for parameters, we create a new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; for the for-statement in the action method that defines the loop variable. (Guess why we made for-init a subrule, and didn't put in &quot;&lt;code&gt;var &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;expression&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in the rule of for-statement). This block is the place to live for the loop variable. The loop variable is declared, initialized using the &lt;code&gt;viviself&lt;/code&gt; attribute, and entered into the new block's symbol table. Note that after creating the new &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; object, we put it onto the stack scope.

Now, the action method for the for statement is quite long, so I'll just embed my comments, which makes reading it easier.

    method for_statement($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        our @?BLOCK;

First, get the result object of the for statement initialization rule; this is the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Var&lt;/code&gt; object, representing the declaration and initialization of the loop variable.

    my $init := $( $&lt;for_init&gt; );

Then, create a new node for the loop variable. Yes, another one (besides the one that is currently contained in the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt;). This one is used when the loop variable is updated at the end of the code block (each iteration). The difference with the other one, is that it doesn't have the &lt;code&gt;isdecl&lt;/code&gt; flag, and it doesn't have a &lt;code&gt;viviself&lt;/code&gt; clause, which would result in extra instructions checking whether the variable is null (and we know it's not, because we initialize the loop variable).

    ## cache the name of the loop variable
    my $itername := $init.name();
    my $iter := PAST::Var.new( :name($itername),
                               :scope('lexical'),
                               :node($/) );

Now, retrieve the &lt;code&gt;PAST::Block&lt;/code&gt; node from the scope stack, and push all statement PAST nodes onto it.

&lt;pre&gt;
    ## the body of the loop consists of the statements written by the user and
    ## the increment instruction of the loop iterator.

    my $body := @?BLOCK.shift();
    $?BLOCK  := @?BLOCK[0];
    for $&lt;statement&gt; {
        $body.push($($_));
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;    

If there was a step, we use that value; otherwise, we use assume a default step size of &quot;1&quot;.

Negative step sizes won't work, but if you Feel Lucky, you could go ahead and try. It's not that hard, it's just a lot of work, and I'm too lazy for that now.... ehm, I mean, I leave it as the proverbial exercise to the reader.

    my $step;
    if $&lt;step&gt; {
        my $stepsize := $( $&lt;step&gt;[0] );
        $step := PAST::Op.new( $iter, $stepsize, :pirop('add'), :node($/) );
    }
    else { ## default is increment by 1
        $step := PAST::Op.new( $iter,
                               :pirop('inc'),
                               :node($/) );
    }

The incrementing of the loop variable is part of the loop body, so add the incrementing statement to &lt;code&gt;$body&lt;/code&gt;.

    $body.push($step);

The loop condition uses the &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator, and compares the loop variable with the maximum value that was specified.

    ## while loop iterator &lt;= end-expression
    my $cond := PAST::Op.new( $iter, $( $&lt;expression&gt; ),
                              :name('infix:&lt;=') );

Now we have the PAST for the loop condition and the loop body, so now create a PAST to represent the (&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;) loop.

    my $loop := PAST::Op.new( $cond, $body,
                              :pasttype('while'),
                              :node($/) );

Finally, the initialization of the loop variable should go before the loop itself, so create a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Stmts&lt;/code&gt; node to do this:

    make PAST::Stmts.new( $init, $loop,
                          :node($/) );
    }


Wow, we've done it! This was a good example of how to implement a non-trivial statement type using PAST.

Up till now, we've implemented a great deal of the Squaak language. We've seen assignments, control-flow statements, variable declarations and scope, subroutines and invocation. Our expressions have been limited so far to singular values, such as string literals and integer constants.
In this episode, we'll enhance Squaak so it can handle operators, so you can construct more complex expressions.

==Operators, precedence and parse trees==
We will first briefly introduce the problem with recursive-descent parsers (which parsers generated with the PCT are) when parsing expressions. Consider the following mini-grammar, which is a very basic calculator.

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule TOP {
       &lt;expression&gt;*
    }

    rule expression {
       &lt;term&gt;
    }

    rule term {
       &lt;factor&gt; [ &lt;addop&gt; &lt;factor&gt; ]*
    }

    token addop { '+' | '-' }

    rule factor {
       &lt;value&gt; [ &lt;mulop&gt; &lt;value&gt; ]*
    }

    token mulop { '*' | '/' | '%' }

    rule value{
       | &lt;number&gt;
       | '(' &lt;expression&gt; ')'
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This basic expression grammar implements operator precedence by taking advantage of the nature of a recursive-descent parser (if you haven't seen the word, google it). However, the big disadvantage of parsing expressions this way, is that the parse trees can become quite large. Perhaps more importantly, the parsing process is not very efficient. Let's take a look at some sample input. We won't show the parse trees as shown in [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Poking in Compiler Guts|Episode 2]], but we'll just show an outline.

input: 42 results in this parse tree:

    TOP
      expression
        term
          factor
            value
              number
                42

As you can see, the input of this single number will invoke 6 grammar rules before parsing the actual digits. Not that bad, you might think.

input: &quot;1 + 2&quot; results in this parse tree (we ignore the operator for now):

    TOP
      expression
        term
          factor
          | value
          |   number
          |     1
          factor
            value
              number
                2

Only a few more grammar rules are invoked, not really a problem either.

input: &quot;(1 + 2) * 3&quot; results in this parse tree:

    TOP
      expression
        term
          factor
            value
            | expression
            |   term
            |   | factor
            |   |   value
            |   |     number
            |   |       1
            |   term
            |     factor
            |       value
            |         number
            |           2
            value
              number
                3

Right; 16 grammar rules just to parse this simple input. I'd call this slightly inefficient. The point is, implementing operator precedence using a recursive-descent parser is somewhat problematic, and given the fact there are better methods to parse expressions like these, not the way to go. Check out [http://epaperpress.com/oper/download/oper.pdf this nice explanation] or google it.

==Bottom-up parsing and stacks: operator tables==
I would like to explain to you how bottom-up parsing works for expressions (or bottom-up parsers in general; Yacc/Bison are parser generators that generate bottom-up parsers for your grammar specification), taking operator precedence into account. However, it's been about 6 years that I did this in a CS class, and I don't remember the particular details. If you really want to know, check out the links at the end of the previous section. It's actually worth checking out. For now, I'll just assume you know what the problem is, so that I'll introduce the solution for PCT-based compilers immediately.
At some point when parsing your input, you might encounter an expression. At this point, we'd like the parser to switch from top-down to bottom-up parsing. The Parrot Grammar Engine supports this, and is used as follows:

    rule expression is optable { ... }

Note that we used the word &quot;expression&quot; here, but you can name it anything. This declares that, whenever you need an expression, the bottom-up parser is activated. Of course, this &quot;optable&quot; must be populated with some operators that we need to be able to parse. This can be done by declaring operators as follows:

    proto 'infix:*' is tighter('infix:+') { ... }

This defines the operator &quot;*&quot; (the &quot;infix:&quot; is a prefix that tells the operator parser that this operator is an infix operator; there are other types, such as prefix, postfix and others). The &quot;is tighter&quot; clause tells that the &quot;*&quot; operator has a higher precedence than the &quot;+&quot; operator. As you could have guessed, there are other clauses to declare equivalent precedence (&quot;is equiv&quot;) and lower precedence (&quot;is looser&quot;).

It is very important to spell all clauses, such as &quot;is equiv&quot; correctly (for instance, not &quot;is equil&quot;), otherwise you might get some cryptic error message when trying to run your compiler. See the references section for the optable guide, that has more details on this.

Of course, the expression parser does not just parse operators, it must also parse the operands. So, how do we declare the most basic entity that represents an operand? It can be anything, from a basic integer-constant, a function call, or even a function definition (but adding two function definition doesn't really make sense, does it?). The operands are parsed in a recursive-descent fashion, so somewhere the parser must switch back from bottom-up (expression parsing) to top-down. To declare this &quot;switch-back&quot; point, write:

    proto 'term:' is tighter('prefix:-')
                  is parsed(&amp;term)       { ... }

The name &quot;term:&quot; is a built-in name of the operator bottom-up parser; it is invoked every time a new operand is needed. The &quot;is parsed&quot; clause tells the parser that &quot;term&quot; (which accidentally looks like &quot;term:&quot;, but you could also have named it anything else) parses the operands.

Note: it is very important to add a &quot;is tighter&quot; clause to the declaration of the &quot;term:&quot; rule. Otherwise your expression parser will not work! My knowledge here is a bit limited, but I usually define it as &quot;is tighter&quot; relative to the tightest operator defined.

==Squaak Operators==
We have defined the entry and exit point of the expression (bottom-up) parser, now it's time to add the operators. Let's have a look at Squaak's operators and their precedence. The operators are listed with decreasing precedence (so that high-precedence operators are listed at the top). (I'm not sure if this precedence table is common compared to other languages; some operators may have a different precedence w.r.t. other operators than you're used to. At least the mathematical operators are organized according to standard math rules).

    unary &quot;-&quot;
    unary &quot;not&quot;
    * / %
    + - ..
    &lt; &lt;= &gt;= &gt; != ==
    and
    or

(&quot;..&quot; is the string concatenation operator). Besides defining an entry and exit point for the expression parser, you need to define some operator as a reference point, so that other operators' precedence can be defined relative to that reference point. My personal preference is to declare the operator with the lowest precedence as the reference point. This can be done like this:

    proto 'infix:or' is precedence('1') { ... }

Now, other operators can be defined:

    proto 'infix:and' is tighter('infix:or') { ... }
    proto 'infix:&lt;' is tighter('infix:and') { ... }
    proto 'infix:+' is tighter('infix:&lt;') { ... }
    proto 'infix:*' is tighter('infix:+') { ... }
    proto 'prefix:not' is tighter('infix:*') { ... }
    proto 'prefix:-' is tighter('prefix:not') { ... }

Note that some operators are missing. See the exercises section for this. For more details on the use of the optable, check out &lt;code&gt;docs/pct/pct_optable_guide.pod&lt;/code&gt; in the Parrot repository.

== Short-circuiting logical operators ==

Squaak has two logical operators: and and or; and results true if and only if both operands evaluate to true, while or results true if at least one of its operands evaluates to true. Both operands are short-circuited, which means that they don't evaluate both operands if that's unnecessary. For instance, if the first operand of the and operator evaluates to false, then there's no need to evaluate the second operand, as the final result of the and-expression cannot become true anymore (remember: both operands must evaluate to true).

Let's think about how to implement this. When evaluating an and-expression, we first evaluate the first operand, and if it's true, only then does it make sense to evaluate the second operand. This behavior looks very much the same as an if-statement, doesn't it? In an if-statement, the first child is always evaluated, and if true, the second child (the &quot;then&quot; block) is evaluated (remember, the third child -- the &quot;else&quot; clause -- is optional). It would be great to be able to implement the and operator using a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op( :pasttype('if') )&lt;/code&gt; node. Well, you can, using the &quot;&lt;code&gt;is pasttype&lt;/code&gt;&quot; clause! Here's how:

    proto 'infix:and' is tighter('infix:or')
                      is pasttype('if') { ... }

So what about the or operator? When evaluating an or-expression, the first operand is evaluated. If it evaluates to true, then there's no need to evaluate the second operand, as the result of the or-expression is already true! Only if the first operand evaluates to false, is it necessary to evaluate the second child. Mmmmm.... what we're saying here is, unless the first operand evaluates to true, evaluate the second child. Guess what pasttype you'd need for that!

== Operators PAST types and PIR instructions ==

In the previous section, we introduced the &quot;pasttype&quot; clause that you can specify. This means that for that operator (for instance, the &quot;and&quot; operator we discussed), a &lt;code&gt;PAST::Op( :pasttype('if') )&lt;/code&gt; node is created. What happens if you don't specify a pasttype?

In that case a default PAST::Op node is created, and the default pasttype is 'call'. In other words, a PAST::Op node is created that calls the declared operator. For instance, the &quot;infix:+&quot; operator results in a call to the subroutine &quot;infix:+&quot;. This means you'll need to implement subroutines for each operator.
Now, that's a bit of a shame. Obviously, some languages have very exotic semantics for the &quot;+&quot; operator, but many languages just want to use Parrot's built-in add instruction. How do we achieve that?
Instead of adding a &quot;pasttype&quot; clause, specify a &quot;pirop&quot; clause. The &quot;pirop&quot;, or &quot;PIR operator&quot;, clause tells the code generator what operator should be generated. Instead of generating a subroutine invocation with the operands as arguments, it will generate the specified instruction with the operator's operands as arguments. Neat huh? Let's look at an example:

    proto 'infix:+' is tighter('infix:&lt;')
                    is pirop('n_add') { ... } 

This specifies to use the &quot;&lt;code&gt;n_add&lt;/code&gt;&quot; instruction, which tells Parrot to create a new result object instead of changing one of the operands. Why not just the &quot;add&quot; instruction (which takes two operands, updating the first), you might think. Well, if you leave out this &quot;is pirop&quot; stuff, this will be generated:

    $P12 = &quot;infix:+&quot;($P10, $P11)

You see, three registers are involved. As we mentioned before, PCT does not do any optimizations. Therefore, instead of the generated instruction above, it just emit the following:

    n_add $P12, $P10, $P11

which means that the PMCs in registers &lt;code&gt;$P10&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$P11&lt;/code&gt; are added, and assigned to a newly created PMC which is stored in register &lt;code&gt;$P12&lt;/code&gt;.

== To circumfix or not to circumfix ==

Squaak supports parenthesized expressions. Parentheses can be used to change the order of evaluation in an expression, just as you're probably have seen this in other languages. Besides infix, prefix and postfix operators, you can define circumfix operators, which is specified with the left and right delimiter. This is an ideal way to implement parenthesized expressions:

    proto 'circumfix:( )' is looser('infix:+')
                          is pirop('set') { ... }

By default, a subroutine invocation will be generated for each operator, in this case a call to &quot;&lt;code&gt;circumfix:( )&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. However, we are merely interested in the expression that has been parenthesized. The subroutine would merely return the expression. Instead, we can use the pirop attribute to specify what PIR operation should be generated; in this case that is the &quot;set&quot; operation, which sets one register to the contents of another.

This solution works fine, except that &quot;set&quot; instructions are a bit of a waste. What happens is, the contents of some register is just copied to another register, which is then used in further code generation. This &quot;set&quot; instruction might as well be optimized away. Currently, there are no optimizations implemented in the PCT.

There is an alternative solution for adding grammar rules for the parenthesized expressions, by adding it as an alternative of term. The grammar rule term then ends up as:

    rule term {
        | &lt;float_constant&gt; {*}     #= float_constant
        | &lt;integer_constant&gt; {*}   #= integer_constant
        | &lt;string_constant&gt; {*}  #= string_constant
        | &lt;primary&gt; {*}            #= primary
        | '(' &lt;expression&gt; ')' {*} #= expression
    }

Of course, although we save one generated instruction, the parser will be slightly more inefficient, for reasons that we discussed at the beginning of this episode. Of course, you are free to decide for yourself how to implement this; this section just explains both methods. At some point, optimizations will be implemented in the PCT. I suspect &quot;useless&quot; instructions (such as the &quot;set&quot; instruction we just saw) will then be removed.

==Expression parser's action method==
For all grammar rules we introduced, we also introduced an action method that is invoked after the grammar rule was done matching. What about the action method for the optable? Naturally, there must be some actions to be executed.

Well, there is, but to be frank, I cannot explain it to you. Every time I needed the action method for an optable, I just copied it from an existing actions file. Of course, the action method's name should match the name of the optable (the rule that has the &quot;is optable&quot; clause). So, here goes:

    method expression($/, $key) {
        if ($key eq 'end') {
            make $($&lt;expr&gt;);
        }
        else {
            my $past := PAST::Op.new(
                          :name($&lt;type&gt;),
                          :pasttype($&lt;top&gt;&lt;pasttype&gt;),
                          :pirop($&lt;top&gt;&lt;pirop&gt;),
                          :lvalue($&lt;top&gt;&lt;lvalue&gt;),
                          :node($/) );
            for @($/) {
                $past.push( $($_) );
            }
            make $past;
        }
    }

==What's Next?==
This episode covered the implementation of operators, which allows us to write complex expressions. By now, most of our language is implemented, except for one thing: aggregate data structures. This will be the topic of [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Hash Tables and Arrays|Episode 8]]. We will introduce the two aggregate data types: array and hashtables, and see how we can implement these. We'll also discuss what happens when we pass such aggregates as subroutine arguments, and the difference with the basic data types.

==Exercises==

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 1:
Currently, Squaak only has grammar rules for integer and string constants, not floating point constants. Implement this grammar rule. A floating-point number consists of zero or more digits, followed by a dot and at least one digit, or, at least one digit followed by a dot and any number of digits. Examples are: 42.0, 1., .0001. There may be no whitespace between the individual digits and the dot. Make sure you understand the difference between a &quot;rule&quot; and a &quot;token&quot;.
:;Hint: currently, the Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE), the component that &quot;executes&quot; the regular expressions (your grammar rules), matches alternative subrules in order. This means that this won't work:

          rule term {
            &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;integer_constant&gt;
            &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;float_constant&gt;
            ...
          }

because when giving the input &quot;42.0&quot;, &quot;42&quot; will be matched by &lt;integer_constant&gt;, and the dot and &quot;0&quot; will remain. Therefore, put the &lt;float_constant&gt; alternative in rule term before &lt;integer_constant&gt;. At some point, PGE will support longest-token matching, so that this issue will disappear.

;Solution:

&lt;pre&gt;
token float_constant {
    [
    &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; \d+ '.' \d*
    &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; \d* '.' \d+
    ]
    {*}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

;Problem 2:
Implement the missing operators: (binary) &quot;-&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;==&quot;, &quot;!=&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;or&quot;

;Solution:

For sake of completeness (and easy copy-paste for you), here's the list of operator declarations as I wrote them for Squaak:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule expression is optable { ... }

    proto 'infix:or' is precedence('1')
                     is pasttype('unless') { ... }
    proto 'infix:and' is tighter('infix:or')
                      is pasttype('if') { ... }

    proto 'infix:&lt;'   is tighter('infix:and') { ... }
    proto 'infix:&lt;='  is equiv('infix:&lt;') { ... }
    proto 'infix:&gt;'   is equiv('infix:&lt;') { ... }
    proto 'infix:&gt;='  is equiv('infix:&lt;') { ... }
    proto 'infix:=='  is equiv('infix:&lt;') { ... }
    proto 'infix:!='  is equiv('infix:&lt;') { ... }

    proto 'infix:+'   is tighter('infix:&lt;')
                      is pirop('n_add')   { ... }
    proto 'infix:-'   is equiv('infix:+')   
                      is pirop('n_sub')   { ... }

    proto 'infix:..'  is equiv('infix:+')   
                      is pirop('n_concat') { ... }

    proto 'infix:*'   is tighter('infix:+') 
                      is pirop('n_mul')     { ... }
    proto 'infix:%'   is equiv('infix:*')   
                      is pirop('n_mod')     { ... }
    proto 'infix:/'   is equiv('infix:*')   
                      is pirop('n_div')     { ... }

    proto 'prefix:not' is tighter('infix:*')   
                       is pirop('n_not')   { ... }
    proto 'prefix:-'   is tighter('prefix:not')
                       is pirop('n_neg')   { ... }

    proto 'term:'      is tighter('prefix:-') 
                       is parsed(&amp;term)      { ... }
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
Welcome to [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Hash Tables and Arrays|Episode 8]]! This is the second-last episode in this tutorial. After this episode, we'll have a complete implementation of our Squaak language.
This episode focuses on aggregate data structures: arrays and hashtables. We'll discuss the syntax to assign to them and to construct them. We'll see that implementing the action methods is really easy, almost trivial. After that, we'll make some notes on aggregates as arguments, and how they differ from the basic data types when passing them around as subroutine arguments.

==Arrays and Hashtables==
Besides basic data types such as integer, floating-point and string, Squaak has two aggregate data types: array and hashtable. An array is an object that can store a sequence of values. The values in this sequence can be of different types, unlike some languages that require all elements of an array to be the same type. An example of using arrays is shown below:

    grades[0] = &quot;A&quot;
    grades[1] = &quot;A+&quot;
    grades[2] = &quot;B+&quot;
    grades[3] = &quot;C+&quot;

A hashtable stores key-value pairs; the key is used as index to store a value. Keys must be string constants, but the value can be of any type. An example is shown below:

    lastnames{&quot;larry&quot;}   = &quot;wall&quot;
    lastnames{&quot;allison&quot;} = &quot;randal&quot;

==Array constructors==
Just as there are integer literals (42) and string literals (&quot;hello world&quot;) that can be assigned to variables, you can have array literals. Below is the grammar rule for this:

    rule array_constructor {
       '[' [ &lt;expression&gt; [',' &lt;expression&gt;]*]? ']'
       {*}
    }

Some examples are shown below:

    foo = []
    bar = [1, &quot;hi&quot;, 3.14]
    baz = [1, [2, 3, 4] ]

The first example creates an empty array and assigns this to foo. The second example shows the construction of three elements, assigning the array to bar. Note that the elements of one array can be of different types. The third example shows the construction of nested arrays. This means that element &lt;code&gt;baz[1][0]&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to the value 2 (indexing starts at 0).

==Hashtable constructors==
Besides array literals, Squaak supports hashtable literals, that can be constructed through a hashtable constructor. The syntax for this is expressed below:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule hash_constructor {
        '{' [&lt;named_field&gt; [',' &lt;named_field&gt;]* ]? '}'
         {*}
    }

    rule named_field {
        &lt;string_constant&gt; '=&gt;' &lt;expression&gt;
        {*}
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some examples are shown below:

    foo = {}
    bar = { &quot;larry&quot; =&gt; &quot;wall&quot;, &quot;allison&quot; =&gt; &quot;randal&quot; }
    baz = { &quot;a&quot; =&gt; { &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 42} }

The first line creates an empty hashtable and assigns this to foo. The second creates a hashtable with two fields: &quot;larry&quot; and &quot;allison&quot;. Their respective values are: &quot;wall&quot; and &quot;randal&quot;. The third line shows that hashtables can be nested, too. There, a hashtable is constructed that has one field, called &quot;a&quot;, and its value is another hashtable, containing a field &quot;b&quot; that has the value 42.

==Implementation==
You might think implementing support for arrays and hashtables looks rather difficult. Well, it's not. Actually, the implementation is rather straightforward. First, we're going to update the grammar rule for primary:

&lt;pre&gt;
    rule primary {
        &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;postfix_expression&gt;*
        {*}
    }

    rule postfix_expression {
        | &lt;index&gt; {*}   #= index
        | &lt;key&gt; {*}     #= key
    }

    rule index {
        '[' &lt;expression&gt; ']'
        {*}
    }

    rule key {
        '{' &lt;expression&gt; '}'
        {*}
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

A primary object is now an identifier followed by any number of postfix-expressions. A postfix expression is either a hashtable key or an array index. Allowing any number of postfix expressions allows to nest arrays and hashtables in each other, allowing us to write, for instance:

    foo{&quot;key&quot;}[42][0]{&quot;hi&quot;}

Of course, you as a Squaak programmer must make sure that foo is actually a hashtable, and that &lt;code&gt;foo{&quot;key&quot;}&lt;/code&gt; yields an array, and so forth. Implementing this is actually quite simple. First, let us see how to implement the action method index.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method index($/) {
        my $index := $( $&lt;expression&gt; );

        my $past := PAST::Var.new( $index,
                                 :scope('keyed'),
                                 :viviself('Undef'),
                                 :vivibase('ResizablePMCArray'),
                                 :node($/) );
        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, we retrieve the PAST node for expression. Then, we create a keyed variable access operation, by creating a PAST::Var node and setting its scope to 'keyed'. If a PAST::Var node has keyed scope, then the first child is evaluated as the aggregate object, and the second child is evaluated as the index on that aggregate.

But wait! The PAST::Var node we just created has only one child!

Here's where the updated action method for primary comes in. This is shown below.

&lt;pre&gt;
    method primary($/) {
        my $past := $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );

        for $&lt;postfix_expression&gt; {
            my $expr := $( $_ );
            $expr.unshift( $past );
            $past := $expr;
        }
        make $past;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, the PAST node for identifier is retrieved. Then, for each postfix-expression, we get the PAST node, and unshift the (current) &lt;code&gt;$past&lt;/code&gt; onto it. Effectively, the (current) $past is set as the first child of &lt;code&gt;$expr&lt;/code&gt;. And you know what &lt;code&gt;$expr&lt;/code&gt; contains: that's the keyed variable access node, that was created in the action method index.

After that, &lt;code&gt;$past&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;$expr&lt;/code&gt;; either there's another postfix-expression, in which case this $past will be set as the first child of that next postfix-expression, or, the current $past is set as the result object.

==Implementing Constructors==
To implement the array and hashtable constructors, we're going to take advantage of Parrot's Calling Conventions (PCC). The PCC supports, amongst others, optional parameters, named parameters and slurpy parameters. If you're Dutch, you might think that slurpy parameters make a lot of noise (&quot;slurpen&quot; is a Dutch verb meaning drinking carefully, which you usually do if your beverage is hot, making noise in the process), but you would be wrong. Slurpy parameters will store all remaining arguments that have not yet been stored in other parameters (implying that there can only be one slurpy (positional) parameter, and it should come after all normal (positional) parameters). Parrot will automatically create an aggregate to store these remaining arguments. Besides positional slurpy parameters, you can also define a named slurpy parameter, which will store all remaining named parameters, after all normal (named) arguments have been stored.

You might be confused by now.

Let's look at an example, as this issue is worth a few brain cells to store.

&lt;pre&gt;
    .sub foo
      .param pmc a
      .param pmc b
      .param pmc c :slurpy
      .param pmc k :named('x')
      .param pmc l :named('y')
      .param pmc m :named :slurpy

    .end

    foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 6 :named('y'), 5 :named('x'), 7 :named('p'), 8 :named('q') )
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will result in the following mapping:

    a: 1
    b: 2
    c: {3, 4}
    k: 5
    l: 6
    m: {&quot;p&quot;=&gt;7, &quot;q&quot;=&gt;8}

So, after the positional parameters (a, b), c is declared as a slurpy parameters, storing all remaining positional parameters. Parameters k and l are declared as named parameters, which have the respective names &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Using these names, values can be passed. After the named parameters, there's the parameter m, which is both flagged as named and slurpy. This parameter will store all remaining named arguments that have not yet been stored by the normal named parameters.

The interesting parameters for us are &quot;c&quot; and &quot;m&quot;. For the positional slurpy parameter, Parrot creates an array, while for the named slurpy parameter a hashtable is created. This happens to be exactly what we need! Implementing the array and hash constructors becomes trivial:

&lt;pre&gt;
    .sub '!array'
      .param pmc fields :slurpy
      .return (fields)
    .end

    .sub '!hash'
      .param pmc fields :named :slurpy
      .return (fields)
    .end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Array and hashtable constructors can then be compiled into subroutine calls to the respective Parrot subroutines, passing all fields as arguments. (Note that these names start with a &quot;!&quot;, which is not a valid Squaak identifier. This prevents us from calling these subs in normal Squaak code).

==Basic data types and Aggregates as arguments==
All data types, both basic and aggregate data types are represented by Parrot Magic Cookies (PMCs). The PMC is one of the four built-in data types that Parrot can handle; the others are integer, floating-point and string. Currently, the PCT can only generate code to handle PMCs, not the other basic data types.
Parrot has registers for each its four built-in data types. The integer, floating-point and string registers store the actual data value, while PMC registers store a reference to the PMC object. This has consequences for how PMCs are handled when passing them as arguments. When passing a PMC as an argument, the invoked subroutine gets access to the PMC reference; in other words, PMCs are passed by reference. This means that the subroutine can change the original argument that was passed by the caller. Of course, it depends what instructions are being generated, what the invoked subroutine does to the references.
In Squaak, when passing basic data values, these cannot be changed by the invoked subroutine. When assigning a new value to a parameter, a whole new object is created and bound to the parameter identifier. No changes are made to the original argument.
Aggregate data types are handled differently, however. When an invoked subroutine assigns to an index or hashtable field of a parameter, then the original argument is affected.
In other words, basic data types have by value semantics, while aggregate data types have by reference semantics. A short example to demonstrate this:

&lt;pre&gt;
    sub foo(a,b,c)
      a       = 42
      b[0]    = 1
      c{&quot;hi&quot;} = 2
    end

    var a = 0
    var b = []
    var c = {}
    foo(a,b,c)

    print(a, b[0], c{&quot;hi&quot;} ) # prints 0, 1, 2
&lt;/pre&gt;

==What's Next?==
This was the last episode to discuss implementation details to make Parrot (run) Squaak. After doing this episode's exercises, your implementation should be fairly complete. Next episode will be the last of this series, in which we'll recap what we did, and demonstrate our language with a nice demo program.

==Exercises==

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 1:
We've shown how to implement keyed variable access for arrays, by implementing the action method for index. The same principle can be applied to keyed access for hashtables. Implement the action method for key.

&lt;pre&gt;
method key($/) {
 my $key := $( $&lt;expression&gt; );

 make PAST::Var.new( $key, :scope('keyed'),
                           :vivibase('Hash'),
                           :viviself('Undef'),
                           :node($/) );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 2:
Implement the action methods for array_constructor and hash_constructor. Use a PAST::Op node and set the pasttype to 'call'. Use the &quot;name&quot; attribute to specify the names of the subs to be invoked (e.g., :name(&quot;!array&quot;) ). Note that all hash fields must be passed as named arguments. Check out PDD26 for doing this, and look for a &quot;named &quot; method.

&lt;pre&gt;
method named_field($/) {
    my $past := $( $ );
    my $name := $( $ );
    ## the passed expression is in fact a named argument,
    ## use the named() accessor to set that name.
    $past.named($name);
    make $past;
}

method array_constructor($/) {
    ## use the parrot calling conventions to 
    ## create an array, 
    ## using the &quot;anonymous&quot; sub !array 
    ## (which is not a valid Squaak name)
    my $past := PAST::Op.new( :name('!array'), 
                              :pasttype('call'), 
                              :node($/) );
    for $&lt;expression&gt; {
        $past.push($($_));
    }
    make $past;
}

method hash_constructor($/) {
    ## use the parrot calling conventions to 
    ## create a hash, using the &quot;anonymous&quot; sub 
    ## !hash (which is not a valid Squaak name)
    my $past := PAST::Op.new( :name('!hash'), 
                              :pasttype('call'),

;Problem 3:
We'd like to add a little bit of syntactic sugar for accessing hashtable keys. Instead of writing foo{&quot;key&quot;}, I'd like to write foo.key. Of course, this only works for keys that do not contain spaces and such. Add the appropriate grammar rule (call it &quot;member&quot;) that enables this syntax, and write the associated action method. Make sure this member name is converted to a string.
:Hint: use a PAST::Val node for the string conversion.

&lt;pre&gt;
rule postfix_expression {
 | &lt;key&gt; {*}         #= key
 | &lt;member&gt; {*}      #= member
 | &lt;index&gt; {*}       #= index
}

rule member {
 '.' &lt;identifier&gt;
 {*}
}

method member($/) {
 my $member := $( $&lt;identifier&gt; );
 ## x.y is syntactic sugar for x{&quot;y&quot;},
 ## so stringify the identifier:
 my $key    := PAST::Val.new( :returns('String'),
                              :value($member.name()),
                              :node($/) );

 ## the rest of this method is the same
 ## as method key() above.
 make PAST::Var.new( $key, :scope('keyed'),
                           :vivibase('Hash'),
                           :viviself('Undef'),
                           :node($/) );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{PVM/Squaak TOC}}
Welcome to the final Episode of the Parrot Compiler Tools Tutorial! Let's review the previous episodes, and summarize this tutorial.

==Review==
In [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Introduction|Episode 1]], we introduced the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT), gave a high-level feature overview of Squaak, the case study language that we are implementing in this tutorial, and we generated a language shell that we use as a foundation to implement Squaak.

[[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Poking in Compiler Guts|Episode 2]] discussed the general structure of PCT-based compilers. After this, we described each of the four default compilation stages: parse phase, parse tree to PAST, PAST to POST and POST to PIR. We also added a command line banner and command line prompt to the interactive language shell.

In [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Squaak Details and First Steps|Episode 3]], we introduced the full grammar of the Squaak language. After this, we started implementing the first bits, after which we were able to generate code for (simple) assignments.

In [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/PAST Nodes and More Statements|Episode 4]] we discussed the construction of Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree nodes in more detail, after which we implemented the if-statement and throw-statement.

[[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Variable Declaration and Scope|Episode 5]] focused on variable declarations and variable scope. We implemented the necessary infrastructure to handle global and local variables correctly. In [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Scope and Subroutines|Episode 6]] we continued the discussion of scope, but now in the context of subroutines. After this we implemented subroutine invocation.

[[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Operators and Precedence|Episode 7]] extended our grammar to handle complex expressions that allows us to use arithmetic and other operators. We discussed how to use PCT's built-in support for handling operator precedence.

In the previous episode, [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Squaak Tutorial/Hash Tables and Arrays|Episode 8]], we discussed the grammar and action methods for handling the aggregate data types of Squaak: arrays and hashes. We also touched on the topic of argument passing by reference and by value.

If you followed the tutorial and did the exercises, your implementation should be complete. Although a lot of the implementation was discussed, some parts were left as the proverbial exercise to the reader. This is to stimulate you to get your hands dirty and figure out things for yourself, while the text contained enough hints (in my opinion) to solve the given problems. Sure enough, this approach requires you to spend more time and think for yourself, but I think you're reading all this stuff to learn something. The extra time spent is well worth it, in my opinion.

Now it's time to see what we can do with this language. Squaak is more than just the average calculator example, which is often provided in beginner's discussions on parsers; it's a complete programming language.

==What's Next?==
This is the last episode of the Parrot Compiler Tools tutorial. We showed how we implemented a complete language for the Parrot virtual machine in only a few hundred lines of source code. Surely, this must be the proof that the PCT really is an effective toolkit for implementing languages. At the moment of writing, the PCT still lacks efficient support for certain language constructs. Therefore, we focused on the parts that are easy to build with the PCT. Once the PCT is feature complete, there's bound to be another tutorial on advanced features. Think of object-oriented programming, closures, coroutines, and advanced control-flow such as return statements. Most of them can be done already, but are too complex for this tutorial's level.

==The Game of Life==
You might have noticed that Squaak looks a bit like Lua, although it does differ in some points. This is not entirely accidental. In the distribution of the Lua source code, there's an example called &quot;life.lua&quot;, which implements Conway's &quot;Game of Life&quot;. This is a nice demonstration program, and it's easy to port it to Squaak. Its implementation is shown below. Run it, and enjoy!

&lt;pre&gt;
    ## John Conway's Game of Life
    ## Implementation based on life.lua, found in Lua's distribution.
    ##
    var width          = 40    # width of &quot;board&quot;
    var height         = 20    # height of &quot;board&quot;
    var generation     = 1     # generation couner
    var numgenerations = 50    # how often should we evolve?

    ## initialize board to all zeroes
    sub initboard(board)
        for var y = 0, height do
            for var x = 0, width do
                board[y][x] = 0
            end
        end
    end

    ## spawn new life in board, at position (left, top),
    ## the life data is stored in shapedata, and shape width and
    ## height are specified.
    sub spawn(board, left, top, shapew, shapeh, shapedata)
        for var y = 0, shapeh - 1 do
            for var x = 0, shapew - 1 do
                board[top + y][left + x] = shapedata[y * shapew + x]
            end
        end
    end

    ## calculate the next generation.
    sub evolve(thisgen, nextgen)
        var ym1 = height - 1
        var y   = height
        var yp1 = 1
        var yi  = height

        while yi &gt; 0 do
            var xm1 = width-1
            var x   = width
            var xp1 = 1
            var xi  = width

            while xi &gt; 0 do

                var sum = thisgen[ym1][xm1]
                        + thisgen[ym1][x]
                        + thisgen[ym1][xp1]
                        + thisgen[y][xm1]
                        + thisgen[y][xp1]
                        + thisgen[yp1][xm1]
                        + thisgen[yp1][x]
                        + thisgen[yp1][xp1]

                nextgen[y][x] = sum==2 and thisgen[y][x] or sum==3

                xm1 = x
                x   = xp1
                xp1 = xp1 + 1
                xi  = xi - 1
            end

            ym1 = y
            y   = yp1
            yp1 = yp1 + 1
            yi  = yi - 1

        end
    end

    ## display thisgen to stdout.
    sub display(thisgen)
        var line = &quot;&quot;
        for var y = 0, height do
            for var x = 0, width do
                if thisgen[y][x] == 0 then
                    line = line .. &quot;-&quot;
                else
                    line = line .. &quot;O&quot;
                end

            end
            line = line .. &quot;\n&quot;
        end
        print(line, &quot;\nLife - generation: &quot;, generation)
    end

    ## main program
    sub main()
        var heart   = [1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1]
        var glider  = [0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1]
        var explode = [0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0]

        var thisgen = []
        initboard(thisgen)

        var nextgen = []
        initboard(nextgen)

        spawn(thisgen,3,5,3,3,heart)
        spawn(thisgen,5,4,3,3,glider)
        spawn(thisgen,25,10,3,4,explode)

        while generation &lt;= numgenerations do
            evolve(thisgen, nextgen)
            display(thisgen)
            generation = generation + 1

            ## prevent switching nextgen and thisgen around,
            ## just call evolve with arguments switched.
            evolve(nextgen, thisgen)
            display(nextgen)
            generation = generation + 1

        end
    end

    ## start here.
    main()
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the use of a subroutine &quot;print&quot;. Check out the file src/builtins/say.pir, and rename the sub &quot;say&quot; (which was generated by the language shell creation script) to &quot;print&quot;.

=== Solution ===

If you don't feel like doing exercises or just want to see what it looks like without doing any trouble, here's what it looks like (this is life generation 9).

&lt;pre&gt;
    -----------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------
    -----O-----------------------------------
    ----OO-----------------------------------
    --OO--O----------------------------------
    -----OO----------------------------------
    --OOOOO------------------OOO-------------
    ------------------------O---O------------
    -----------------------O-----O-----------
    ----------------------O---O---O----------
    ----------------------O--O-O--O----------
    ----------------------O---O---O----------
    -----------------------O-----O-----------
    ------------------------O---O------------
    -------------------------OOO-------------
    -----------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------

    Life - generation: 9
&lt;/pre&gt;
But really, it doesn't compare to seeing this program run on Parrot :-)

==Exercises==

Squaak was designed to be a simple language, offering enough features to get some work done, but at the same time keeping it simple. Of course, after reading this tutorial, You are an expert too ;-) If you feel like adding more features, here are some suggestions.

* Implement prefix and postfix increment/decrement operators, allowing you to write &quot;generation++&quot; instead of &quot;generation = generation + 1&quot;.
* Implement augmenting assign operators, such as &quot;+=&quot; and friends.
* Extend the grammar to allow multiple variable declarations in one statement, allowing you to write &quot;var x = 1, y, z =3&quot;. Of course, the initialization part should still be optional. How do you make sure that the identifier and initialization expression are kept together?
* Implement a mechanism (such as an &quot;import&quot; statement) to include or load another Squaak file, so Squaak programs can be split into multiple files. The PCT does not have any support for this, so you'll need to write a bit of PIR to do this.
* Improve the for-statement, to allow for a negative step. Note that the loop condition becomes more complex when doing so.

Note that these are suggestions, and I did not implement them myself, so I won't have a solution for you at the end.

==Final words and Acknowledgments==
By now, you should have got a good impression of the PCT and you should be able to work on other languages targeting Parrot. Currently, work has been done on ECMAScript, Python, Ruby and of course Perl 6. Most of them are not complete yet (hint, hint).

I hope you enjoyed reading this tutorial and learned enough to feel confident about working on other (existing) languages targeting Parrot. The Perl 6 implementation can still use more contributors!

Many thanks to all who read this tutorial and provided me with hints, tips and feedback! Thank You for reading this!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hand fishing ==
It is possible to fish with minimal equipment by using only the hands. In the British Isles, the practice of catching trout by hand is known as trout tickling; it is an art mentioned several times in the plays of Shakespeare.

Trout binning is a method of fishing, possibly fictional, performed with a sledgehammer.

Divers can catch lobsters by hand.

Pearl diving is the practice of hunting for oysters by free-diving to depths of up to 30 m.

Hand-line fishing is a technique requiring a fishing line with a weight and one or more lure-like hooks.

Noodling or Stump Fishing is a technique in which the fisher holds the bait in his or her hand and waits for a large catfish to attempt to eat it; when the fish bites, the fisher pulls his or her arm, along with the fish, from the water. 

Seafood can be found in coastal zones as well as rivers and lakes around the world. Seafood suitable for gathering by hand includes aquatic invertebrates such as molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms as well as aquatic plants. Some molluscs (shellfish) commonly gathered are oysters, clams, scallops and cockles. Some crustaceans commonly gathered are lobster, crayfish, and crabs. A common plant gathered is kelp. Echinoderms are not gathered as much as mollusks and crustaceans. In Asia, sea cucumber and sea urchins are gathered.

Very little, or no specialized equipment is required to gather many of these sea foods. We would expect to see evidence for shellfish consumption in prehistory, since the discarded shell can remain for long periods. In fact the earliest evidence for shellfish consumption dates back to a 300,000 year old site in France called Terra Amata. This is a hominid site as modern Homo sapiens did not appear until around 50,000 years ago. The importance of shellfish in prehistoric diet has been the source of much debate in archaeology. Sometimes they are referred to as a famine food and their nutritional value is played down at the expense of terrestrial or non-marine food sources.

Some shellfish are gathered by diving. Pearl diving is the practice of hunting for oysters by free-diving to depths of up to thirty metres. Abalone are also gathered by diving. Divers can also catch lobsters by hand.

==Spearfishing==

The methods and locations freedive spearfishers use vary greatly around the world. This variation extends to the species of fish sought and the gear used.

===Shore diving===
Shore diving is perhaps the most common form of spearfishing and simply involves entering and exiting the sea from beaches or headlands and hunting around ocean architecture, usually reef, but also rocks, kelp or sand. Usually shore divers hunt between 5 and 25 meters (about 17 to 83 feet) depth, though it depends on location. In some locations in the South Pacific, divers can experience huge drop-offs from 5 meters up to 30 or 40 meters very close to the shore line. Sharks and reef fish can be abundant in these locations. In more subtropical areas, sharks may be less common, but other challenges face the shore diver, such as entering and exiting the water in the presence of big waves. Headlands are favored for entry because of their proximity to deeper water, but timing entries and exits is important so the diver does not get pushed onto rocks by waves. Beach entry can be safer, but more difficult due the need to consistently dive through the waves until the surf line is crossed.

Shore dives can produce a mixed bag of fish, mainly reef fish, but ocean going pelagic fish are caught from shore dives too, and can be specifically targeted.

Shore diving can be done with trigger-less spears such as pole spears or Hawaiian slings, but more commonly triggered devices such as spearguns. Speargun setups to catch and store fish include speed rigs, fish stringers.

The use of catch bags worn close to the body is discouraged because the bag can inhibit movement, especially descent or ascent on deeper freedives. Moreover, in waters known to contain sharks, it is positively dangerous and can greatly increase the risk of attack. The better option is to tow a float behind, to which is attached a line onto which a catch can be threaded. Tying the float line to the speargun can be of great assistance in the event of a large catch, or if the speargun should be dropped or knocked out of reach.

===Blue water hunting===
Blue water hunting is the area of most interest to elite spearfishers, but has increased in popularity generally in recent years. It involves accessing usually very deep and clear water and trolling, chumming for large pelagic fish species such as marlin, tuna, or giant trevally. Blue water hunting is often conducted in drifts; the boat driver will drop one or more divers and allow them to drift in the current for up to several kilometers before collecting them. Blue water hunters can go for hours without seeing any fish, and without any ocean structure or a visible bottom the divers can experience sensory deprivation. It can be difficult to determine the true size of a solitary fish when sighted due to the lack of ocean structure for comparison. One technique to overcome this is to note the size of the fish's eye in relation to its body - large examples of their species will have a relatively smaller eye.

Notably, blue water hunters make use of breakaway rigs and large multi band wooden guns to catch and subdue their prey. If the prey is large and still has fight left after being subdued, a second gun can be used to provide a kill shot at a safe distance from the fish. This is acceptable to IBSRC and IUSA regulations as long as the spearfisher loads it himself in the water.

Blue water hunting is conducted world wide, but notable hot spots include South Africa (yellow fin tuna) and the South Pacific (dog-tooth snapper). Blue water pioneers like Jack Prodanavich and Hal Lewis of San Diego were some of the first to go after large species of fast moving fish like Tuna.

===Without diving===
These methods have been used for thousands of years. A fisher wades in shallow salt or fresh water with a hand spear. The fisher must account for optical refraction at the water's surface, which makes the fish appear to be further away. By experience, the fisher learns to aim lower to hit the target. Calm and shallow waters are favored for spearing fish from above the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Fish traps==
A fishtrap is a trap resembling a fishing weir or a lobster trap. It consists of a frame of thick steel wire, usually in the shape of a heart, with chicken wire stretched around it. The mesh wraps around the frame and then tapers into the inside of the trap. When a fish swims inside through this opening, it cannot get out, as the chicken wire opening bends back into its original narrowness. A fishing weir is an ancient type of fish trap that is traceable back to Roman times in the UK. It is also a technology used by, among others, North American Natives and early settlers to catch fish for trade and to feed their communities.

The fishtrap is best placed in shallow water near rocks, where pikes in particular like to lie. The trap is usually very effective for an amateur fisher, if placed correctly. It is usually not necessary to check the trap daily, since the fish remain alive inside the trap, relatively unhurt. Because of this, the trap also allows for the release of undersized fish as per fishing regulations.

Formerly, it has also been constructed of wood and/or wood splints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;buttonStatus&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
If your program does not do any kind of event-trapping using the &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement, then you can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; function to determine whether the mouse button is currently down. In these circumstances, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;_zTrue &lt;/code&gt;is the button is down, or &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; function will not work if your program traps events using &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;. Since most well-designed programs trap events this way, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; function is probably of limited usefulness. See the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mouse%20event.html&quot;&gt;MOUSE &amp;lt;event&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;functions to learn how to respond to mouse clicks using event trapping.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You can also use the Toolbox function &lt;code&gt;FN BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; to determine whether the mouse is currently down. &lt;code&gt;FN BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; works regardless of whether your program uses event trapping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== HANDLEEVENTS == 
 


=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;performs a number of important functions that affect the user's experience. It examines the system event queue, as well as FutureBasic's internal event queues, to see whether any recent events have occurred for your program, that have not yet been handled. If any such events are found, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; removes them from the queue and responds to them. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; also performs the important function of turning over control to the Process Manager. The Process Manager oversees the execution of all processes on your Macintosh; once it has control, the Process Manager may allow another application to run for a short time before returning control to your application.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; responds to some kinds of user actions by calling functions that you have designated in your program. It responds to other kinds of user actions in predetermined, &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; ways.

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Automatic&amp;quot; responses by &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Allows the Process Manager to bring another process to the front, if the user has&amp;nbsp;selected it in the Applications menu or clicked in one of its windows.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Opens menus and tracks selection, if user has clicked on the menu bar.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Activates an inactive window, if the user has clicked on the window's structure&amp;nbsp;region (e.g. its title bar). (This action is inhibited if the window's &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Handles dragging &amp;amp; resizing of the active window.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Performs &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; handling of mouseclicks and keystrokes in the currently active&amp;nbsp;edit field (if any).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Highlights &amp;amp; tracks various objects when they're clicked (e.g. buttons, window close&amp;nbsp;box, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;For any window that requires updating: redraws all buttons, scrollbars, edit fields and&amp;nbsp;picture fields (unless the window's &lt;code&gt;_noAutoClip&lt;/code&gt; feature is set). Also redraws certain&amp;nbsp;parts of the window's structure region.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the user presses cmd-period, and no &lt;code&gt;ON BREAK FN&lt;/code&gt; function has been identified, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays a dialog asking whether the user wants to stop or to&amp;nbsp;continue. If the user elects to stop, FB then calls your designated &lt;code&gt;ON STOP FN&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function (if any), and then halts the program.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: You can inhibit and/or alter these responses by trapping low-level events (especially the &lt;code&gt;_mButDwnEvt&lt;/code&gt; event) in a system event-handling function. See below for more details.

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Programmed&amp;quot; responses by &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;There are many kinds of common user actions, such as button clicks and menu selections, which you will want to explicitly handle with program statements. When you write a function that is to handle events of a certain type, you designate it as an event-handling function by executing statements like &lt;code&gt;ON DIALOG FN &amp;lt;functionName&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;ON MENU FN &amp;lt;functionName&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Once you've designated your event-handling function(s) this way, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will examine recent user actions to determine whether any of them are of the kind that your function(s) can handle. If any such events are found, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; calls the appropriate event-handling function once for each such event. See the descriptions of the various &lt;code&gt;ON &amp;lt;eventType&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;statements, to learn what types of user actions can be handled.

If you haven't identified a function to handle a certain class of user actions, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; just ignores actions of that class. For example, if you have not identified any function with the &lt;code&gt;ON DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; statement, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will ignore button clicks and other similar actions. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will still perform the &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; responses listed above, however.

&lt;strong&gt;Intercepting system events&lt;/strong&gt;
There may be times when you need greater control over how &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; responds to certain events. For example, you may want to inhibit or alter some of the &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; responses that &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; normally performs. To do this, you should designate one of your functions as a &amp;quot;system event-handling function,&amp;quot; by using the &lt;code&gt;ON EVENT &lt;/code&gt;statement. Once you've designated such a function, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; calls that function first , before it executes any of its &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; responses and before it calls any of the other event-handling functions you may have designated. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; either passes a system event to your function (if there's an event in the queue), or it passes a &amp;quot;null event&amp;quot; to your function (if there are no events in the queue).

After your system event-handling function returns, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; continues to handle that same event, unless it was a null event. Depending on what the event was, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may perform some of its &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; responses, or it may call another one of your event-handling functions. If you don't want &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to continue handling the event after your system event-handling function exits, then you need to &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; FB into thinking that the event was a null event. You do this by executing a line like the following, in your system event-handling function, after you've handled the event:

&lt;code&gt;theEvent&amp;amp;.evtNum% = _nullEvt&lt;/code&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;theEvent&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to the event record.

In order to provide the user with snappy response to actions, and to share execution time with other processes, your program should call &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as often as possible. Most well-designed programs contain a &amp;quot;main event loop&amp;quot; which calls &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly for as long as the program is executing, allowing &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to call the various event-handling functions as events occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== HANDSHAKE == 
 


=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;HANDSHAKE portID, handshakeType&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;
Sets the handshaking parameter for the open serial port specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;portID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which can be either &lt;code&gt;_modemPort&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_printerPort&lt;/code&gt;). The handshaking parameter determines how i/o operations will be negotiated when your program subsequently writes to or reads from the specified port. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handshakeType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can take any of the following values:

&lt;b&gt;INSERT IMAGE HERE!!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;h/handshake.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/HANDSHAKE_statement02.gif&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; width=&quot;546&quot;&gt;

To determine the best handshaking format for a device, see the device's manual.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You must open the serial port (use the &lt;code&gt;OPEN &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;... statement) before executing the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HANDSHAKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Powerbooks require an initialization setting of &lt;code&gt;_none&lt;/code&gt; to preset the serial port properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== HEX$ == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;hexString$ = HEX$(&lt;i&gt;expr)&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a string of hexadecimal digits which represent the integer value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The returned string will consist of either 2, 4 or 8 characters, depending on which of &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR WORD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR LONG&lt;/code&gt; is currently in effect. Note that if the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is too large to fit in a hex string of the currently selected size, the string returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEX$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not represent the true value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

In FB, integers are stored in standard &amp;quot;2's-complement&amp;quot; format, and the values returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEX$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; reflect this storage scheme. You need to keep this in mind when interpreting the results of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEX$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, especially when &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a negative number. For example: &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEX$&lt;/b&gt;(-3)&lt;/code&gt; returns &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;FD&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; when &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE&lt;/code&gt; is in effect; &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;FFFD&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; when &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR WORD&lt;/code&gt; is in effect; and &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;FFFFFFFD&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; when &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR LONG&lt;/code&gt; is in effect.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
To convert a string of hex digits into an integer, use the following technique:

&lt;code&gt;intVar = &lt;b&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;(&amp;quot;&amp;amp;H&amp;quot; + hexString$)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;intVar&lt;/code&gt; can be a (signed or unsigned) byte variable, short-integer variable or long-integer variable. Byte variables can handle a &lt;code&gt;hexString$&lt;/code&gt; up to 2 characters in length; short-integer variables can handle a &lt;code&gt;hexString$&lt;/code&gt; up to 4 characters in length; long-integer variables can handle a &lt;code&gt;hexString$&lt;/code&gt; up to 8 characters in length.

      <comment>/* (Re-)Partitioning */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here, we will cover installing an [[w:Ubuntu linux|Ubuntu]] system to your hard drive. Most other distributions use a very similar installation process. If the differences between this documentation and your distro are too great, check the documentation provided for your distro.

Ubuntu Linux has quickly become the golden boy of open source and is considered by some as being the first truly easy-to-use Linux operating system. This is largely because of the installation process which allows the user to run the operating system prior to installation. 

==Boot the LiveCD==
To start an install, place the Ubuntu CD ROM (available for free via postage from [https://shipit.ubuntu.com/ shipit.ubuntu.com]) in your computer and reboot.

When the computer starts again, it should display a screen with the Ubuntu logo displayed on it and a list of options. If your computer does not do so, you may need set the BIOS to boot from CD.

Select the first option in the menu to boot into an Ubuntu desktop session. If you wish, you can get to know the Ubuntu operating system at this point. Using it in roughly the same manner that you would when fully installed (though it is advised not to log out).

Once you feel prepared to start installation, click on the &quot;install&quot; icon on the desktop.

==Begin installation==
Answer the questions on the first few screens of the installation window (language, location, etc.).

===(Re-)Partitioning===
:''For dual-boot systems, see [[../Installing (dual-boot)]].''
:''For advanced partitioning schemes, see [[../Installing (advanced)]].''
When you get to a screen asking which hard disk you wish to install to, select automatic partitioning unless you have planned in advance not to use this one. '''This will erase everything on your hard drive!'''

If you want to use one hard drive for multiple operating systems (for example, Windows and Linux), see [[../Installing (dual-boot)]].

If you want to use multiple partitions for your linux operating system (it is recommended to use separate partitions for &lt;code&gt;/&lt;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; at least), see [[../Installing (advanced)]].&lt;!-- that guide uses CLI - can't we include using Gparted here for the / and /home partitions we're recommending?--&gt;

===Set up your user account===
Continue to the next screen and then fill in your name and desired password. This will become your administrative account. If you do not want to use such on a daily basis, fill in your name as master user or such and place an appropriate account name in its text box. Using this account, you can create further accounts on the computer (note that the name Administrator is not available). 

Once you have done this, click on Next, check the details are correct and click Next again to start the actual installation process which will likely take around 20 to 30 minutes at the most. 

After this a prompt will appear saying that you should reboot. After doing so, Ubuntu is ready to be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== KILL APPLEEVENT == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;KILL APPLEEVENT eventType&amp;amp;, eventClass&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
May, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
Once established, an Apple Event remains in effect for the life of your program. This includes event handlers that you create as well as event handlers that are created by the runtime. One example might be the apple event that opens a document. Its event type is &lt;code&gt;_&amp;quot;core&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and its class is &lt;code&gt;_&amp;quot;odoc&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. If you wanted to override these established settings you would begin by removing the old version.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;REM&lt;/b&gt; _coreEventType = _core&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;REM&lt;/b&gt; _kAEOpenDocuments = _odoc&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL APPLEEVENT&lt;/b&gt; _kRequiredEventClass,_kAEOpenDocuments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you are ready to establish a new vector.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON APPLEEVENT&lt;/b&gt;(_kRequiredEventClass,_kAEOpenDocuments) &amp;not;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FN&lt;/b&gt; myODocHandler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;INSERT IMAGE HERE!!!!&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;res/cd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; height=&quot;19&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;CD Example: AppleEvents Folder&lt;/pre&gt;

== Suggested New Section ==

I was wondering wether any would be interested in collaborating on a book about the history of chess that would explain how all the accepted theories came to be formed and what the major movements were in chess thinking. Maybe from the lives of the great chess masters and what new ideas they brought to the game. I am always surprised at how differently chess was played 200 years ago when all out attack was considered the only way to victory and I think it is important and interesting to understand the developements. I am by no means an expert or even a well read amatuer bu I would be happy to help research and organise if anyone else would be interested.

:I might consider doing that later. However, it's probably going to be delayed, what with all my other projects

=== Description ===
This statement releases the memory allocated for use by a dynamic array. The array may still be used after the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL DYNAMIC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed and will begin to grow once again as information is added.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== KILL FIELD == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;KILL FIELD handle&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement disposes of the specified handle. This means that the memory block referenced by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gets released, and the value in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is thereafter no longer a valid handle. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL FIELD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is commonly used with handles returned by &lt;code&gt;GET FIELD &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;READ FIELD&lt;/code&gt;, but it can dispose of any kind of handle. However, you should specifically NOT use it to dispose of resources, regions, window controls, and other &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; kinds of Macintosh objects which are created and managed by the MacOS. Instead, you should use the appropriate Toolbox routine (ReleaseResource, DisposeRgn, DisposeControl, etc.) to dispose of such objects.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL FIELD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is similar to the Toolbox call &lt;code&gt;DisposeHandle&lt;/code&gt;, except that it (like the &lt;code&gt;DEF DISPOSEH&lt;/code&gt; statement) checks for &lt;code&gt;_nil&lt;/code&gt; handles and sets the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; variable to zero.

=== See Also ===
&lt;code&gt; DEF DISPOSEH; GET FIELD; READ FIELD; SYSERROR&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== KILL PICTURE == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;KILL PICTURE pictureHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement calls the Toolbox procedure KillPicture, which releases the memory occupied by the picture which is specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictureHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This should be a handle that your program created using the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE ON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PICTURE OFF&lt;/code&gt; statements (or the Toolbox routines OpenPicture and ClosePicture), or the &lt;code&gt;USR GETPICT&lt;/code&gt; statement. You should not use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL PICTURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to release a picture handle that was created by other means (for example, a picture resource handle).

Warning: Do not use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL PICTURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to kill a picture that is currently being displayed in a picture field. You must close the picture field first (using the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD CLOSE &lt;/code&gt;statement) before calling &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL PICTURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Warning: You should make sure that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictureHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not equal zero before calling &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL PICTURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Disposing of a &amp;quot;nil handle&amp;quot; can cause problems on some older systems.

=== See Also ===
&lt;code&gt;PICTURE; PICTURE ON/OFF; PICTURE FIELD; EDIT FIELD; CLOSE&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== KILL RESOURCES == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;KILL RESOURCES &amp;quot;resType&amp;quot;, resID%, [&amp;quot;resType&amp;quot;, resID%...]&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
October 19, 2000 (Release 4)

=== Description ===
This statement will store specified resource types and IDs in an internal list. When one of these resources is encountered by the compiler, it will not be added to the built application.

There are two important reasons for a call like this. The first is that resources normally included in the runtime shells may be considered unnecessary by a programmer may easily be deleted from the finished product. The second is that multiple resource files may be used and unnecessary resources may be eliminated programmatically.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To prevent a picture resource with an ID of 8001 from being added to the compiled application, the syntax would be:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL RESOURCES&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;PICT&amp;quot;, 8001&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;RESOURCES&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== KILL == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;KILL path$ [,refNum% [,dirID&amp;amp;]]&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement deletes a (closed, unlocked) file or folder from the disk. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;path$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;parameter can be either a full or partial pathname; the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be a working directory reference number, a volume reference number, a drive ID number, or zero. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dirID&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter is a directory ID number of the item's parent directory. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dirID&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not specified, then the current &lt;code&gt;PARENTID&lt;/code&gt; value (if nonzero) is used instead. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;KILL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; resets the &lt;code&gt;PARENTID&lt;/code&gt; value to zero after the item is deleted.

The easiest way to use this statement is to specify the item's name in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;path$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the volume reference number of its volume in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and the ID number of its parent directory in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dirID&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For other ways to use these parameters, see Appendix A: Specifying Files and Folders.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You cannot delete a folder if it has any contents, nor if the folder is &amp;quot;open.&amp;quot; A folder is considered &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; if your program has executed any statement which returned a working directory reference number for the folder, and has not subsequently closed it using the &lt;code&gt;CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;code&gt;PARENTID CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/code&gt;

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= CVI function =
 
== CVI == 
 
=== Function === 

✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;string&lt;/i&gt;$)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function converts the bytes in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; into an integer value which has the same internal bit-pattern that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; consists of 4 or more bytes, only its first 4 bytes are considered. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; consists of 1, 2 or 3 bytes, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns an 8-bit, 16-bit or 24-bit integer, respectively. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a null string, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns zero.

This function is useful for finding the integer form of such things as file types, creator signatures and resource types. For example:

&lt;code&gt;ft$ = &amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
theType&amp;amp; = CVI(ft$)&lt;/code&gt;

After executing the above, &lt;code&gt;theType&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is then suitable for passing to a Toolbox routine which requires a file-type parameter. &lt;code&gt;theType&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; will also have the same value as the integer constant &lt;code&gt;_&amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot;.&lt;/code&gt;

The size (in bytes) of the value returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; depends on the length of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It does not depend on the current setting of &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE/WORD/LONG&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, if you want to assign the return value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a short integer variable, you must make sure that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not longer than 2 bytes; otherwise, you'll get an unexpected value in your short integer variable. Similarly, if you want to correctly assign &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s return value to a byte variable, you should make sure that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not longer than 1 byte.

The &lt;code&gt;MKI$&lt;/code&gt; function is the inverse of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Note, however, that the output of &lt;code&gt;MKI$&lt;/code&gt; does depend on the current setting of &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE/WORD/LONG&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Note ===
If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 1 byte long, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVI&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns the same value as &lt;code&gt;ASC(&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= CSRLIN function =
 
 

 
== CSRLIN == 
 
=== function === 
 
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;currentLine&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;CSRLIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns the number of the &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; text line (that is, the text line which contains the current pen position) for the current window. The text line at the top of the window is considered Line #0.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CSRLIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not necessarily reflect the number of text lines which have actually been displayed. It is calculated based on the current pen position and the size of the current font.

=== Example ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TEXT&lt;/b&gt; _monaco, 16&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
CLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FOR&lt;/b&gt; i = 1 &lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;CSRLIN = &amp;quot;; &lt;b&gt;CSRLIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
NEXT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CSRLIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Text Window before executing. The value returned is the actual line number in the edit field and remains accurate even when the field is scrolled.

      <comment>/* Conflicting goals? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a grammatical error in the following sentence:

However if this is your first contact with programming then continue on reading, and take in consideration that the Programming Paradigms section can be hard to digest if you lack some bases, don't despair, the relevant points will be extended when other concept are introduced, that section is provided to give you a mental framework to help you not only to understand C++, but to let you easily adapt to (and from) other languages that share those concepts.

Should be &quot;...when other concepts are introduced...&quot;

Note that concept is singular in the current form, which creates a disagreement with the following word, &quot;are&quot;

:Txs for spotting that... I have corrected it now.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:13, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

== Conflicting goals? ==

It looks like there has been some conflict about what this book is suppose to be, the oldest charter I could find indicated that this was intended to be a reference book, the structure of this book seems to follow one that of an expanded reference book, but this statement contradicts this:

''This book covers the C++ programming language, its interactions with software design and real life use of the language. It is presented as an introductory to advance course but can be used as reference book.''

Was there any official consensus on this? [[User:Phosgram|Phosgram]] ([[User talk:Phosgram|talk]]) 19:45, 5 October 2010 (UTC)

:It was the result of a administrative forced merge of 2 works, even if I was the only one to object to the merge, we can state that it was a consensus as restoring to the previous situation is impossible now.
:In any case there is no active conflict now.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:56, 5 October 2010 (UTC)

::Ah, that explains things.  To pose a different question then, would starting a new book with the goal of being strictly a complete and detailed reference of the standard library (basic descriptions \ prototypes \ example code) be acceptable?  There might be a lot of overlap with this book and I'm not sure if it would violate the &quot;Wikibooks is not&quot; guidelines, but if this book is intended to become a introductory to advanced &quot;learn C++&quot; book I'm thinking trying to make it back into a detailed reference book would be &quot;chasing two hares&quot;. [[User:Phosgram|Phosgram]] ([[User talk:Phosgram|talk]]) 02:22, 6 October 2010 (UTC)

:::There is already one [[Understanding C++]] (standard restricted) if you need only to stick to the standard if not and you are intending to duplicate content then extend this one. Take a look on the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library|C Standard part of this book]], I think that is what you are proposing, notice that since there is no real editorial control it would be extremely difficult to keep it clean (without the theory part) you can already notice some creep on the C standard library.
:::See if you would like to complete the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords]], I have been doing that slowly as to make it fit the rest of the book the result seems to be what you are after.
:::[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/union]] and [[C++ Programming/Unions]] can give you an idea.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:31, 6 October 2010 (UTC)

::::Understanding C++ isn't what I'm considering, you are correct about something similar to C Standard part.
:::::''See if you would like to complete the Keywords...''
::::So the goal of having a full standard reference as part of this book is still being pursued? I guess I'm finding the current guidelines a bit ambiguous as to what scope(s) this book is intending to cover (a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; style C Primer Plus, a K&amp;R-like general overview, an &quot;expanded reference&quot;, or something else?). I didn't think a &quot;kitchen-sink&quot; approach would be desirable for the reason you listed (no strict control making it difficult to keep clean). It would be quite difficult to keep the unrelated subsections, such as the reference part of the book and the individual lessons, from mixing together into a tangled mess as new contributors add new content. [[User:Phosgram|Phosgram]] ([[User talk:Phosgram|talk]]) 09:08, 7 October 2010 (UTC)

:::::The [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords|keywords]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type/Data Types|data types]], etc, aren't the a full standard reference...
:::::If you have a copy of the standard you can see that it has lots of theory but it can't be used directly to learn the language as it takes for granted that the reader already &quot;knows&quot; the language, it is a reference text. Well it could but it would be extremely difficult to rely only on it for learning the language... 
:::::To me the scope of this book is all things C++ (until very recently this was the only wikibook on the C++ language), with the concern in the ordering and interconnecting the material in a way it can be used as a learning textbook, so far we have managed that. As I said see if you can work on the keywords for now, I will help you out with making it fit with the rest of the text...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:22, 7 October 2010 (UTC)

::::::I'm guessing, from the earlier discussions I was able to find, it was suppose to be a reference on the ''essential features of the language'' rather then the whole standard. Probably a mistake on my part, but I can't find the page I was reading that proposed the book be a reference guide.
::::::I don't think having an &quot;all things C++&quot; scope is realistic if you ever want this book to be finished. There is a near infinite number of topics that could fall under that scope. [[User:Phosgram|Phosgram]] ([[User talk:Phosgram|talk]]) 22:59, 9 October 2010 (UTC)

:::::::We can certainly limit what goes into the book but by definition a Wikibook is never finished at best it will be in a usable state and that can be archived at different states of development, a strict limitation will be harder to implement that leaving it open ended to participation. So far there is much of the basic still missing for example locale and streams have almost no work done.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:30, 10 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Work in progress!

This card is a suggested method for the neurological examination of the lower limb.

Example Stem:  &quot;This patient has noticed difficulty walking.  Please examine him.&quot;


== Initial Inspection ==

* Wash your hands
* Introduce yourself to the patient and shake their hand
* Ask the patient to undress to their underwear
* With the patient standing upright in front of the examination couch, perform a general inspection
** Look for wasting or asymmetry
** Look for unsteadiness of their posture at rest
* Ask them if they usually require a walking aid
* Get them to walk a few steps away from you, assessing their gait
* Ask them to turn and walk back towards you
* Test their Rhomberg's sign by asking them to stand with their feet together, then close their eyes
** Make sure they are standing away from the couch / wall so they cannot lean against it
** Be seen to be ready to catch them if they are Rhomberg's positive
* If their gait was normal and there was no obvious weakness, test proximal strength by asking them to squat, then rise from squatting
** If this is normal, then ask them to repeat, looking for fatiguability suggesting myaesthenia
*** If the patient is able to do this, the abnormality is probably not in the motor system
* While they are standing, examine their lower back for scars or tender areas
* Ask them to lie supine on the couch
* At rest, examine proximally for fasiculations in the thigh muscles

=== Assess Tone ===

* Ask the patient to try and relax completely.  Explain you will move their leg, but you do not want them to help at all
* Dorsiflex and plantarflex one ankle a few times to assess their relaxation.  Once happy they are relaxed, forcefully dorsiflex (not too hard!) to look for clonus

Partial Classes

As the name indicates, partial class definitions can be split up across multiple physical files. To the compiler, this does not make a difference as all the fragments of the partial class are grouped and the compiler treats it as a single class. One common usage of partial classes is the separation of automatically generated code from programmer written code.

Below is the example of a partial class.
Listing 1: Entire class definition in one file (file1.cs)

public class Node
{
    public bool Delete()
    {
    }

    public bool Create()
    {
    }
}

Listing 2: Class split across multiple files

(file1.cs)

public partial class Node
{
    public bool Delete()
    {
    }
}

(file2.cs)

public partial class Node
{
    public bool Create()
    {
    }

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the final section (Section C) of the exam, you have to be able to write about how waves are used to find the distance of a remote object. I would recommend that you pick a method, and then answer the following questions about it:

1. What sort of wave does your system use? What is an approximate wavelength of this wave?

2. What sort of distance is it usually used to measure? What sort of length would you expect the distance to be?

3. Why is measuring this distance useful to society?

4. Draw a labelled diagram of your system.

5. Explain how the system works, and what data is collected.

6. Explain how the distance to the object is calculated using the data collected.

7. What limitations does your system have? (e.g. accuracy, consistency)

8. What percentage error would you expect these limitations to cause?

9. How might these problems be solved?

==Examples==
Some example answers to these questions are given in the following pages:

* [[/Radar/]]

* [[/Sonar/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. What sort of wave does your system use? What is an approximate wavelength of this wave?'''

Radio waves, with a wavelength ranging from 2.7mm to 100m.

'''2. What sort of distance is it usually used to measure? What sort of length would you expect the distance to be?'''

The distance to an object within the radio horizon. This width is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{horizon}_\mathrm{km} = 3.569 \times \sqrt{\mathrm{height}_\mathrm{metres}}.&lt;/math&gt;

So, a radar 10m above the Earth's surface has a range of 11.3km.

'''3. Why is measuring this distance useful to society?'''

e.g. Radar is used at airports to locate aeroplanes and co-ordinate them so that they can land safely, avoiding collisions.

'''4. Draw a labelled diagram of your system.'''

[[Image:Radar_advphys_sec_c_eg.png]]

'''5. Explain how the system works, and what data are collected.'''

The 'dish' rotates, and the transmitter on it transmits a pulse of radio waves. The waves, if they hit an aircraft, are reflected by it. The dish reflects the reflected radio pulse onto a receiver (allowing for some variety in incoming angles due to varying distances of aircraft). The time taken for the signal to travel to the aircraft and back is recorded, and the speed of the radio pulse (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) is already known.

'''6. Explain how the distance to the object is calculated using the data collected.'''

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{s}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s = tv\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where s = distance, t = time and v = velocity. In this case, the time taken to travel to the aircraft t is half of the total time taken to travel to the aircraft and back T, so:

&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{Tv}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''7. What limitations does your system have? (e.g. accuracy, consistency)'''

* Random noise e.g. birds, weather
* Deliberate attempts to evade radar detection e.g. radio-wave-absorbent paint
* The aircraft are moving, so, in the time taken for the signal to return to the radar station and be processed, the aircraft will no longer be in the position calculated.

'''8. What percentage error would you expect these limitations to cause?'''

If we assume a distance from station to aircraft as 5km, the speed of EM waves as 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and the aircraft's speed as 500kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time taken for the signal to return from the aircraft would be 1.67 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;s. 500kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 500000mh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 139ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the aircraft would have moved 2.31mm in the time taken for the signal to return to the radar station. This means that there is a ±0.0000463% potential for error in the distance reading, depending on the direction of the aircraft's travel. This may seem insignificant, but readings are only taken once every rotation of the dish, so this potential error gets a lot larger in reality.

'''9. How might these problems be solved?'''

Take multiple readings over a period of time, and use a computer to predict where the aircraft will be next given the aircraft's current trajectory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. What sort of wave does your system use? What is an approximate wavelength of this wave?'''

Sound waves travelling in water, with an approximate wavelength of the order of 100μm.

'''2. What sort of distance is it usually used to measure? What sort of length would you expect the distance to be?'''

Distances to things under water, so up to 11km.

'''3. Why is measuring this distance useful to society?'''

It enables fishing trawlers to find schools of fish, which can be used to feed people.

'''4. Draw a labelled diagram of your system.'''

[[Image:Sonar_Principle_EN.svg]]

'''5. Explain how the system works, and what data are collected.'''

A sonar pulse of known velocity is transmitted down into the sea bed. It is reflected of an object, and returns to the ship-board receiver. The time taken to travel there and back is recorded.

'''6. Explain how the distance to the object is calculated using the data collected.'''

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{r}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r = tv\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where r = distance, t = time and v = velocity. In this case, the time taken to travel to the object (e.g. fish) t is half of the total time taken to travel to the object and back T, so:

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{Tv}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''7. What limitations does your system have? (e.g. accuracy, consistency)'''

All sorts of weird things happen with different shapes of object and different frequencies. Accuracy is inversely proportional to the width of the range of frequencies used.

'''8. What percentage error would you expect these limitations to cause?'''


'''9. How might these problems be solved?'''

Use a narrower band of sound.

Historical, subsistence and sport hunting techniques can differ radically, with modern hunting regulations often addressing issues of where, when and how hunts are conducted. Techniques may vary depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local custom, firearms and the animal being hunted. Often a hunter will use a combination of more than one technique, and some are used primarily in poaching and wildlife management, explicitly forbidden to sport hunters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Path Selection''' ==
[[Image:Eaglecreek-28July2006.jpg|right|250px]]
Deciding how to go form point A to B is extremely important. It is part of the planing process of movement, most of the time we do not even realize this simple process but at times that significant effort and resources will be consumed on the task planning how to proceed should be the second step after deciding for a destination. Path selection is '''a decision making  process''' by which one alternative is selected over another. Several procedures for making decisions have been outlined in effort to minimize inefficiencies or redundancies. These are idealized (or normative) processes, and describe how decisions might be made in an ideal world, and how they are described in official documents. Real-world processes are not as orderly.

[[Image:TE-Systems-RationalPlanningAndDecisionMaking.png]]

Planning starts by selecting or deciding for a specific destination choice (this selection may in itself depend on many factors) fallowed by mode and route choices. The route selected my constrain or be depended on the modes of locomotion available.

It can be hard to decide if a path selection starts by establishing a destination, since all other components at some point have the same strength on the decision process. But undoubtedly if one is not required to go somewhere that there is no need to move, except if one is forced to move and then the destination may even be irrelevant. It all depends on the specificity of the situation that motivates the choice of a path.    

In long trips, making a trip distribution (or intermediary destination choice or zonal interchange analysis). This step matches several origins and destinations to develop a “trip table” a matrix that displays the number of trips going from each origin to each destination. Priorities and resources available as well as costs (even effort) must be taken in account. This is basically turning any complex voyage in a sequence of smaller steps as to reach the final objective. 

Trip distribution's zonal interchange analysis yields a set of origin destination tables which tells where the trips will be made, mode choice analysis allows the modeler to determine what mode of transport will be used. Mode choice analysis follows destination choice and may affect route choice.

Route assignment, route choice, or traffic assignment concerns the selection of routes (alternative called paths) between origins and destinations in transportation networks. To determine facility needs and costs and benefits, we need to know the number of travelers on each route and link of the network (a route is simply a chain of links between an origin and destination).

The [[Fundamentals of Transportation]] wikibook is a good work to examine in detail the complexity and analysis behind planning transportation.

{{NOTE|It is interesting to note that path selection as a decision process is not only used for moving from point A to B physically but is the perfect illustration not only of a normal decision process, but even as we saw in how to divide a complex problem in smaller more manageable items. Keep this is mind when thinking about any type cf decision, solution.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;display:{{{display|block}}};background:{{{background|ivory}}};color:{{{color|black}}};font-weight:normal; border:1px solid lightgrey; padding:{{{padding|0.5em 1.5em 0.5em 1.5em}}}; line-height:{{{lh|1.4em}}};font-family:{{{ff|'Courier New',Courier,fixedsys, monospace}}};font-size:{{{fs|1em}}};text-align:{{{ta|center}}};&quot;&gt;{{{content|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;




==Use, Limitations, Parameters and Options==
----

===Use===
----

The template has one parameter: Content; unformatted text for the box.  
The default state produces a pale blue band across the page for a centered Courier text entry; it is useful to emphasise a single code line.

The options can be used in a more elaborate way to assemble a page with contiguous coloured background sections; see the example, which includes an image.
The code to call the template into use and the result of doing so is seen below:  

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{block|ta=left|ff=Arial|background=Lightyellow|color=blue|[[image:rose.jpg|left|150px]]This is a block of fictitious text {{lorem ipsum}}}}{{block|background=papayawhip|{{lorem ipsum}}}}{{block|ta=left|fs=12pt|ff=serif|background=mistyrose|{{lorem ipsum}}}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

{{block|ta=left|lh=1.8em|ff=Arial|background=Lightyellow|color=blue|[[image:rose.jpg|left|150px]]This is a block of fictitious text {{lorem ipsum}}}}{{block|background=papayawhip|{{lorem ipsum}}}}{{block|ta=left|fs=12pt|ff=serif|background=mistyrose|{{lorem ipsum}}}}

===Limitations===
----
It is not possible for the parameter text to start with a wikitext heading, (&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading==&lt;/nowiki&gt;); use the HTML form instead, (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.

A Wikitext table will not render at all well.   Use an HTML table instead and avoid having the table at the start of the parameter.

At times which are not yet clarified, using the ''named'' parameter form, (&lt;nowiki&gt;1= The parameter text...&lt;/nowiki&gt;), works well when the ''unnamed'' equivalent,(&lt;nowiki&gt;The parameter text...&lt;/nowiki&gt;)  does not.      

===Options===
----
;display: display mode, default block, can be set to inline for wrapped text sections. 
;background:   background color, pale blue
;color:   font color, black
;ff:   font family or face, Courier
;fs:   font size, 10pt
;ta:   text alignment, center
;lh:   line height, 1.4em
;padding: content padding.
The defaults produce a pale ivory band in the page for a centered text entry, in a monospaced font.

= Polish Gambit =
===1...b5===
This is considered a dubious response to 1. e4 because it allows [[/2. Bxb5|2. Bxb5]], and if White plays accurately, Black does not get sufficient compensation for the sacrificed b-pawn. As a result, the Polish gambit is almost universally accepted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''A bunch of non scientific tests aiming to do a bit of benchmarking''

Predominately this is a bit of a &quot;mine is faster than yours&quot; type of page, but hopefully it might be useful to someone who is trying to ascertain just what system to buy to do MINC stuff.  If this is you, as a rule of thumb MINC type processing is more than often I/O bound with multiple file I/O's going on all the time.  This means you should buy a motherboard with a fast FSB (Front side bus) instead of just a fast processor and fair chunk of RAM to avoid having to use swap/virtual memory.

The command we use to compute a rough indication of execution time is this:

 time /usr/local/bic/bin/minctracc -clobber -debug -nonlinear -step 2 2 2 \
    /usr/local/bic/share/mni_autoreg/icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc \
    /usr/local/bic/share/mni_autoreg/icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc \
    /tmp/out.xfm

==Notes==
* yes I know it is not the best test, but it seems good enough for now
* yes I know it should make an identity transform and this is something you/we should check

==Results==

Here is an example of a double ended lookup table that you can use with files output from programs like mincblob to make pretty images.

 0.000 0.8 0.8 1.0
 0.125 0.4 0.8 1.0
 0.250 0.0 0.4 1.0
 0.375 0.0 0.0 0.5
 0.500 0.0 0.0 0.0
 0.625 0.5 0.0 0.0
 0.750 1.0 0.4 0.0
 0.825 1.0 0.8 0.4
 1.000 1.0 0.8 0.8

Note that in order to use this you will have to ensure that your input file to minclookup has a symmetric range (ie: ranges from -x to x).

==ICBM152 Linear==

[[Image:ICBM152linT1.png|left|200px|ICBM 152 Linear T1]]

This is a linear average.

In 2001, within the context of the ICBM project (19) a concerted effort
was undertaken by three sites (MNI, UCLA, RIC) to collect a set of full-
brain volumetric images from a normative population specifically for the
purposes of generating a model. 152 new subjects were scanned using T1, T2
and PD sequences as the MNI’s part of the ICBM project using a specific
protocol (27). These images were acquired at a higher resolution than the
original average 305 data and exhibit improved contrast due
predominately to advances in imaging technology. Each individual was
linearly registered to the average 305 and a new model was formed. In
total, three models were created at the MNI, the ICBM152_T1, ICBM152_T2 and
ICBM152_PD from 152 normal subjects. This resulting model is now known as the
ICBM152 (although the model itself has not been published). One advantage
of this model is that it exhibits better contrast and better definition of
the top of the brain and the bottom of the cerebellum due to the increased
coverage during acquisition.

The entirely automatic analysis pipeline of this data also included
grey/white matter segmentation via spatial priors (41). The
averaged results of these segmentations formed the first MNI parametric
maps of grey and white matter. The maps were never made publicly available
in isolation but have formed parts of other packages for some time
including SPM, FSL AIR and as models of grey matter for EEG source location
in VARETTA and BRAINWAVE.

Again, as these models are an approximation of Talairach space, there are
differences in varying areas, to continue our use of origin shift as an
example, the ICBM models are approximately

152: – +3.5mm in Z and +-co-ordinate -3.5mm and 2.0mm in Y as compared to
the original Talairach origin.

In addition to the standard analysis performed on the ICBM data, 64 of
the subjects data were segmented using model based segmentation. 64 of the
original 305 were manually outlined and a resulting parametric VOI atlas
built.

The native data from these acquisitions was 256x256 with 1mm slices. The
final image resolution of this data was 181x217x181 with 1mm isotropic
voxels.

Being able to extend a class such that the subclass has
the same name is a great way to implement aspects.

    extends(stack());                //if subclass has new name
    extends((shadowed(:stack))());   //if subclass has same name

As an alternative, here's an instrumented stack using filters:

    include(&quot;stack.s&quot;);
    
    function emptyPopChecker($expr)
        {
        if ($expr . context . empty?())
            {
            throw(:stackError,&quot;pop on empty stack&quot;);
            }
        force($expr);
        }

Then we make and instrument a particular stack:

    var s = stack();
    
    s . pop . filter = emptyPopChecker;

Not quite right. Anybody?

    function emptyPopChecker2($expr)
        {
        var result = catch(force($expr));
        if (type(result) == :ERROR)
            {
            throw(:stackError,&quot;pop on empty stack&quot;);
            }
        result;
        }

== HLLCompiler Class ==

The HLLCompiler class is used to help instantiate and operate a compiler for a high-level language written for Parrot. HLLCompiler coordinates the execution of the HLL grammar, and controls the conversion of the HLL from PAST to POST, from POST to PIR, and ultimately to Parrot bytecode. 

This page is going to serve as a brief reference to the HLLCompiler class, and a description of how the class is used to create a compiler for an HLL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cast iron is denser than other pan materials, making the pans unparalleled at retaining and evenly distributing heat, but also somewhat heavy. Therefore these pans are excellent for applications such as searing, or any time when a pan must stay hot even as ingredients are added.

The pan retains its heat better than most other materials. They can also be put under a very hot broiler or into a barbecue or campfire — something that would completely destroy a non-stick pan, as they are all-metal and would have to be melted to suffer damage. Contrary to popular belief, acidic foods can be cooked in cast iron, provided they are removed from the pan as soon as cooking is complete.

Cast iron pans can be used for other kinds of cooking as well, although their heaviness makes them somewhat awkward for making, say, crepes, or any other kind of cooking where the pan needs to be moved around a lot during cooking. Cast iron is also less conductive than other materials such as aluminum and copper. This results in the aforementioned excellent heat retention, but also means that cast iron cookware takes longer to heat up and cool down.

==Maintenance==
Cast iron needs to be seasoned to provide a more-or-less non-stick surface. This process involves heating oil so that it polymerizes and binds to the pan. This creates a non-stick surface chemically similar to a plastic coating. Some people see this need for seasoning as a drawback; however, because the seasoning can be removed (with steel wool, even!) and reapplied as needed, cast iron pans can be maintained in excellent condition far beyond the life of a typical non-stick pan.

Properly cared for, a cast iron pan can last for generations. Thus they are an excellent value: extremely durable, costing less than all but the cheapest non-stick pans, while outperforming all but the most expensive cookware. The main drawback is that they will rust if washed in a dishwasher or left soaking in water. Also, they should not be washed with harsh, lye-based soap, as this will remove the seasoning.

They can be effectively cleaned with a stiff brush, plastic wool, or by rubbing with a paper towel, vegetable oil, and any salt, used as a mild abrasive. Prior to putting them back in storage, if you heat them up, empty, for few minutes, any remaining dampness will evaporate. Generally these retail for no more than US $20.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is inadvisable to go out and equip yourself with all of your essentials in one go. But they should be your priorities as and when you are able to add to your stock, and they should be distinguished from the mountain of gadgetry which clutters up the shops in the name of labour-saving: a great many of these supposedly convenient gadgets are often more expensive than the basic tool and a lot less efficient (even when they are not going wrong).

==Meat==
Be careful in keeping the frying-pan clean. See that it is properly tinned. When frying any sort of fish, first dry them in a cloth, and then flour them. Put into the pan plenty of dripping, or hog's lard, and let it be boiling hot before putting in the fish. Butter is not so good for the purpose, as it is apt to burn and blacken, and make them soft. When they are fried, put them in a dish or hair-sieve, to drain, before they are sent to table. Olive oil is the best article for frying, but it is very expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it. Steaks and chops should be put in when the liquor is hot, and done quickly, of a light brown, and turned often. Sausages should be done gradually, which will prevent their bursting.

The first thing requisite for roasting is to have a strong, steady fire, or a clear brisk one, according to the size and weight of the joint that is put down to the spit. A cook, who does not attend to this, will prove herself totally incompetent to roast victuals properly. All roasting should be done open to the air, to ventilate the meat from its gross fumes; otherwise it becomes baked instead of roasted. The joint should be put down at such a distance from the fire as to imbibe the heat rather quickly; otherwise its plumpness and good quality will be gradually dried up, and it will turn shrivelly, and look meagre. When the meat is first put down, it is necessary to see that it lies level in the pan, otherwise the process of cooking will be very troublesome. When it is warm, begin to baste it well, which prevents the nutritive juices escaping; and, if required, additional dripping must be used for that purpose.

As to sprinkling with salt while roasting, most able cooks dispense with it, as the penetrating particles of the salt have a tendency to draw out the animal juices. However a little salt thrown on, when first laid down, is sometimes necessary with strong meats. When the smoke draws towards the fire, and the dropping of the clear gravy begins, it is a sure sign that the joint is nearly done. Then take off the paper, baste well, arid dredge it with flour, which brings on that beautiful brownness which makes roasted meats look so inviting.

With regard to the time necessary for roasting various meats, it will vary according to the different sorts, the time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather. In summer twenty minutes may be reckoned equal to half an hour in winter. A good screen, to keep off the chilling currents of air, is essentially useful. The old housewife's rule is to allow rather more than a quarter of an hour to each pound, and in most instances it proves practically correct.

In roasting mutton or lamb, the loin, the chine, and the saddle, must have the skin raised, and skewered on, and, when nearly done, take off this skin, and baste and flour to froth it up. Veal requires roasting brown, and, if a fillet or loin, be sure to paper the fat, that as little of it may be lost as possible. When nearly done baste it with butter and dredge with flour. Pork should be well done. When roasting a loin, cut the skin across with a sharp knife, otherwise the crackling is very awkward to manage. Stuff the knuckle part with sage and onion, and skewer it up. Put a little drawn gravy in the dish, and serve it up with apple-sauce in a tureen. A sparerib should be basted with a little butter, little dust of flour, and some sage and onions shred small. Apple-sauce is the only one which suits this dish.

Wild fowls require a clear brisk fire, and should be roasted till they are of a light brown, but not too much; yet it is a common fault to roast them till the gravy runs out, thereby losing their fine savor. Tame fowls require more roasting, as the heat is longer in penetrating. They should be often basted, in order to keep up a strong froth, and to improve their plumpness. The seasoning of the dressing or stuffing of a fowl is important to its flavor. The dressing should consist of bread crumbs, seasoned with black pepper, salt, and no herb but thyme. Pigs and geese should be thoroughly roasted before a good fire, and turned quickly. Hares and rabbits require time and care, especially to have the ends sufficiently done, and to remedy that raw discoloring at the neck, etc., which proves often so objectionable at table.

==Fish==
''[[Cookbook:Campfire Trout|Gentgeen's Campfire Trout]]'' is the recipe uses to cook trout caught while camping.  This method can be used at home with trout purchased at the fish market, but somehow never tastes quite as good.

* 2 whole cleaned [[Cookbook:Trout|trout]], between 10 and 14 inches
* 4 strips [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste

Serves 4, or 2 hungry fishermen.
# Make a pan out of [[Cookbook:Aluminum foil|aluminum foil]] slightly larger than your two fish.  The pan should have a double layer of foil on the bottom and a lip around the edge of about 3/4 - 1 inch height. 
# Place the pan on a grill over the campfire.  Put the butter into the pan and allow to begin melting.  Wrap each trout with 2 strips of bacon. Add the trout to the pan. Season to taste.
# After the trout has cooked for a few minutes (5-7 depending on the size of the fish), check the inside.  If the side close to the fire is white and flakes easily, the fish is ready to turn.  Flip the fish, and continue cooking the other side for 3-4 minutes until done. Serve with lemon over a bed of white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">All fire authorities have a fire safety education program in how to prevent fires and the actions they should take in the event of a fire occurring. 

All programs tend to mix messages of general injury prevention, safety, fire prevention and escape in case of fire. In most cases the fire department representative is regarded as the expert and is expected to present information in a manner that is appropriate for each age group.

A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, usually in a fire ring. Campfires are a popular feature of camping, particularly among organized campers such as Scouts or Guides. Without proper precautions they are also potentially dangerous. A certain degree of skill is needed to properly build a campfire, to keep it going, and to see that it is properly extinguished. In some regions it is called a bonfire.

Having found a suitable site and gathered materials, the fire-builder has a variety of designs to choose from. A good design is very important in the early stages of a fire. Most of them make no mention of fuelwood - in most designs, fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly.

The tipi fire-build is perhaps the best, but it is takes some patience to construct. First, the tinder is piled up in a compact heap. The smaller kindling is arranged around it, like the poles of a tipi. For added strength, it may be possible to lash some of the sticks together. A tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks, so a clove hitch should suffice. (Synthetic rope should be avoided, since it produces pollutants when it burns.) Then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling, taking care not to collapse the tipi. A separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better. Tipi fires are excellent for producing heat to keep you warm. 
 
A campfire with colored flames, made by burning a garden hose in a copper pipe.A lean-to fire-build starts with the same pile of tinder as the tipi fire-build. Then, a long, thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle, so that it overhangs the tinder pile. The smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them. 

A log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile. The kindling is then stacked around it, as in the construction of a log cabin. The first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other, on opposite sides of the tinder pile. The second pair is laid on top of the first, at right angles to it, and also on opposite sides of the tinder. More kindling is added in the same manner. The smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly. Of all the fire-builds, the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse, but it is also inefficient, because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel. 

A variation on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuelwood with a pile of tinder between them, and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling should be burning between two pieces of fuelwood. The logs will eventually catch fire from it. 

Another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres. Its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces. If built on a large scale, this type of fire-build collapses in a controlled manner without restricting the air flow. 
A cross-fire is another variation in which two pieces of fuel wood are placed parallel on the ground with tinder between them. Once the kindling is going strong, alternating perpendicular layers of fuelwood are placed across the two base pieces. This type of fire is excellent for producing coals for cooking. 

The traditional Finnish rakovalkea (literally &quot;slit bonfire&quot;) is constructed by placing one long piece of fuelwood atop another, parallel and bolstering them in place with four sturdy posts driven into the ground. (Traditionally, whole unsplit tree trunks are used for the fuelwood.) Kindling and tinder are placed between the logs in sufficient quantity (while avoiding the very ends) to raise the upper log and allow ventilation. The tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts don't burn prematurely. The rakovalkea has two excellent features. First, it burns slowly but steadily when lit; it doesn't require arduous maintenance, but burns for a very long time. A well constructed rakovalkea of two thick logs of two meters in length can warm two lean-to shelters for a whole sleeping shift. The construction causes the logs themselves to protect the fire from the wind. Thus, exposure to smoke is unlikely for the sleepers; nevertheless someone should always watch in case of an emergency. Second, it can be easily scaled to larger sizes (for a feast) limited only by the length of available tree trunks. 

A keyhole fire is made in a keyhole-shaped fire ring, and is used in cooking. The large round area is used to build a fire in order to create coals. As coals develop, they are scraped into the rectangular area used for cooking. 

A &quot;top lighter&quot; fire is built similar to a log cabin or pyre, but instead of the tinder and kindling being placed inside the cabin, it is placed in a tipi on top. The small tipi is lighted on top, and the coals eventually fall down into the log cabin. These fires are often built by youth outdoor movements for &quot;council fires&quot; or ceremonial fires. They burn very predictably, and with some practice a builder can estimate how long they will last. They also don't throw off a lot of heat, which isn't needed for a ceremonial fire. The fire burns from the top down, with the layer of hot coals and burning stubs igniting the next layer down.

How about try blocks? Using the Sway proximal block style:

    var error;
    
    try (error)
        {
        a / b;
        }
    else if (error . type == :undefinedVariable)
        {
        println(&quot;try block has an undefined variable&quot;);
        }
    else
        {
        println(&quot;try block has a divide error&quot;);
        }

Here's the implementation:

    function try($store,$code,$)
        {
        var result = catch(force($code));
        if (error?(result))
            {
            $store = result;
            if ($ != :null,force(car($)));
            }
        else
            {
            result;
            }
        }

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;The ones with big shocks are cross-country mountain bikes.&quot; I don't understand what this is comparing XC bikes with.  If &quot;The ones with big shocks are cross-country mountain bikes.&quot; Then the other mnt bikes are the ones with really big shocks and the ones with really really big shocks.  Maybe I'm not being as clear as I could.  In my understanding, XC mnt bikes are the lightest weight modern mnt bikes, with the intended use being riding long distances over medium terrain, as opposed to all mountain, or down hill mountain bikes that are designed to go over rougher terrain, take bigger drops, (so have bigger travel shocks, more robust tubing, lower gear ratios, and are necessarily heavier) and are difficult to actually pedal places.  --[[User:Keithonearth|Keithonearth]] ([[User talk:Keithonearth|talk]]) 19:31, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

This is a nice introduction and summary; however I think it overstates the case for recumbents and completely neglects the increasing interest and production of mixed use bikes, formerly called hybrids but increasingly referred to by names such as &quot;urban&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, or &quot;street.&quot; Every major manufacturer, eg. Specialized, Trek, Giant, etc. has increasingly developed models in this category. None of these manufacturers make a recumbent.

Other types that deserve discussion utility/transport biking, and touring, just to pull a couple off the top of my head.  Utility and transport in particular, rather than just the sporting and toy uses of bikes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm interested on the bicycle related books here on wikibooks.

I am a Canadian avid transportation cyclist, always on a mission to learn more about bikes.  I use bikes for my daily transportation, and tour on them.

I am more active on wikipedia where I also go by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Keithonearth keithonearth].

I have contributed a number of images to wikipedia, many of which could be a help to the wikibook on bicycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Euclid's Postulate I ==
For every point P and for every point Q not equal to P there exists a unique line that passes through P and Q

=== Explanation ===
Informally, this postulate says that two points determine a unique line.

== Euclid's Postulate II ==
For every segment AB and for every segment CD there exists a unique point E on line AB (needs LaTex formatting) such that B is between A and E and segment CD is congruent to segment BE

=== Explanation ===
[To Come]

== Euclid's Postulate III ==
For every point O and every point A not equal to O, there exists a circle with center O and radius OA

=== Explanation ===
[To Come]

== Euclid's Postulate IV ==
All right angles are congruent to one another

=== Explanation ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Euclidean Parallel Postulate ==
For every line ''l'' and P such that P does not lie on ''l'', there exists a unique line ''m'' through P that is parallel to ''l''

=== Explanation ===
[To Come]

== Attempted Proofs ==
The Euclidean Parallel Postulate can not be proven without taking it as an axiom, which is not done in neutral geometry since it holds in Euclidean but not hyperbolic. Therefore, this is neither true nor false.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Axioms of Betweenness =
== Betweenness Axiom 1 ==
If A*B*C, then A,B, and C are three distinct points all lying on the same line, and C*B*A.

=== Explanation ===

== Betweenness Axiom 2 ==
Given any two distinct points B and D, there exist points A,C, and E lying on line BD (needs format with LaTex) such that A*B*D, B*C*D, and B*D*E.

=== Explanation ===
suppose that in a certain metric gemetry the following distance relationship hold: 
AB= 2 AD=BD=CD=3 BC=4 AC=6

== Betweenness Axiom 3 ==
If A, B, and C are three distinct points lying on the same line, then one and only one of the points is between the other two.

=== Explanation ===

== Betweenness Axiom 4 ==
For every line ''l'' and for any three points A, B, and C not lying on ''l'':
*(i)  If A and B are on the same side of ''l'' and if B and C are on the same side of ''l'', then A and C are on the same side of ''l''.
*(ii) If A and B are on opposite sides of ''l'' and if B and C are on opposite sides of ''l'', then A and C are on the same side of ''l''.

=== Corollary ===
*(iii) If A and B are on opposite sides of ''l'' and if B and C are on the same side of ''l'', then A and C are on opposite sides of ''l''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pasch's Theorem == 
If A, B, C are distinct noncollinear points and ''l'' is any line intersecting AB in a point between A and B, then ''l'' also intersectseither AC or BC. If C does not lie on ''l'', then ''l'' does not intersect both AC and BC

=== Explanation ===

== Crossbar Theorem ==
If ray AD (need LaTex formatting) is between ray AC(need LaTex formatting) and ray AB(need LaTex formatting), then ray AD(need LaTex formatting) intersects segment BC

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cmene are Lojbanized names.  Cmene must be spelled phonetically according to the Lojban style  (it is important to remember: W --&gt; U, Y --&gt; I, Sh --&gt; C, Ch --&gt; Tc, J (English) --&gt; Dj, J (French) --&gt; J, etc. if using the ''latmo lerselcmi'' (Latin alphabet)).  All cmene must terminate with a glottal stop [.], and must additionally have a consonant immediately precede the glottal stop.  If the name begins with a vowel (which includes &quot;''Y''&quot;), then it must also be immediately preceded by a glottal stop.  If the cmene does not terminate with a consonant (excluding the glottal stop), then one must be inserted.  The common convention is to insert an &quot;''S''&quot; at the end.  However, any consonant will work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adopted Rules ==
If not stated otherwise here as a general rule, all guidelines from [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style]] are in effect.

=== Page naming and structure [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

We are using the ''slash convention'' with a ''flat page structure'' as described in [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]]

=== One book with many faces [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

There are two indexed: A chapter-by-chapter version and a all-in-one page version (via transclusion). New pages should be added to both.

=== Size of pages [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

A chapter indexed from the main page should be on one Page. However, no single page should be larger than about 30k. Larger pages should be split up.

=== Use specialized topics [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

By adding contributions, try to help us give some structure to the book, do so by creating as much different and separate chapters/sections and sub-sections possible using unique (if doable) specialized topics so to give the reader the most complete and logic understanding of the language, your are also encouraged to add empty ones, so future contributors my add to them.

=== Authors section [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

Every person making non-trivial changes to this book may add themselves to the [[Video Game Design/About the Book/Authors|Authors]] section. This can be done by adding your name/alias and including a link to one of your wikimedia page, web-page or an active email address where you can be reached.

'''Proposed:''' 19 Sept 2005 '''Voted:''' 21 September 2005 '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Level 1 Heading Nummeration  [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
We are using level 1 headers (&lt;nowiki&gt;=header=&lt;/nowiki&gt;) for the parts. To allow transclusion, main submodules should always start with and have at most 1 level 2 header (&lt;nowiki&gt;==header==&lt;/nowiki&gt;). 

'''Proposed:''' 20 Sept 2005 '''Not Contested''', '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Source code style [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

To allow adoption from other sources, there is no mandatory brace / indentation style throughout the book for code examples. However, please be consistent within one example.

There is a non adoption of a single standard on styles (ie: brace style) so to make the work of importing any other snips of code easier, it also shows readers all the options they can make, so you can use the style you prefer and modify any existing code on the book, but authors are not expected to follow a particular style.

=== Common Programming Errors [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

Common programming errors should pointed out throughout the book. 

'''Proposed:''' 18 Sept 2005 '''Not Contested''', '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

&lt;nowiki&gt;

&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Proposed:''' 27 Nov 2004 '''Not Contested, Moved to adopted by:''' --Panic 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

If a proposed issue is not contested, debated or altered in 7 days it should be moved out of the '''Proposed''' section as adopted.

== Question ==

Hello. Can I upload Fair Use images on English Wikibooks e.g Windows screens? I asking, because I haven't a big knowlege about EN Wikibooks. But I know that on Polish Wikibooks I don't upload screens on FU licension (Polish right). And my very very late: Happy Easter:) I'm sorry that later, but in real life I've had a lot of work. But probably I'm going to more activity on EN Wikibooks in future:) [[User:Prasuk historyk|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff8c00&quot;&gt;'''Prasuk'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Prasuk historyk|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#add8e6&quot;&gt;''Dyskusja''&lt;/span&gt;]] 08:58, 30 March 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, we allow fair use on the English edition. The relevant policy is [[WB:MEDIA]]. Basically, use fair use only when needed (screenshots of proprietary software when discussing that software would be one example) and provide a {{tlx|fair use rationale}}. If you need help with anything, come on back. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:46, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

== license tags on wikiversity ==

hi, I created a page at wv to start a discussion on [[v:Wikiversity talk:Licensing policy]].  I've been trying to delete copyvio and fix incorrect license info on images by hand.  I'd like to ask you some questions on the bot you were running and see where to go next. BTW, do you know how I can get Editor and Reviewer on test.wikipedia.org to try out flagged revisions?  --[[User:Mu301|mikeu]] ([[User talk:Mu301|talk]]) 01:36, 1 April 2008 (UTC)

==[[:Category:Naming convention change]]==

Is emtpy! However ran into a slight problem on the last one.  Needed to delete a page as there was a book with a duplicate name and thought I could get round it by moving the page.  Forgot about the redirect!  As a result could you delete [[J2ME Programming delete]] and [[J2ME Programming]].  Then [[Programming:J2ME]] can be moved to [[J2ME Programming]]. Thanks --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 06:23, 1 April 2008 (UTC)

== wikipedia transwiki ==

Mike,

I don't quite understand the transwiki.  Is the whole wikipedia entry or page brought over, or is just part of it.  Is the text of the Wikipedia entry brought over to the wikibook, or is it linked?  --[[User:Jsigler|Jsigler]] ([[User talk:Jsigler|talk]]) 17:39, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:It will be a copy of the entire article with (usually) all the old revisions too (ie the whole edit history). You can then pare down to only the stuff you want. So if you get me to bring over [[w:Albert Einstein]], then you can probably remove 80-90% of the content, then refactor it to fit into your book (ie split into sections appropriate for a Wikijunior book) and then move it into the book. I don't know how useful that would be for a class of young kids, but it might make things easier than trying to find freely-licensed content on the internet, and using that. Alternatively, if you only want to use small parts of Wikipedia articles, you can just put &quot;from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Article name at Wikipedia]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; in the [[m:edit summary|edit summary]], and that would be fine in terms of attribution. Feel free to [[Special:Emailuser/Mike.lifeguard|email]] me if you like. I hope that helps. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:21, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

== limit on # of accounts created ==

I had my students start creating their wikibook acounts, but ran into a roadblock.  6 of my students were able to create accounts in the computer lab and the rest got &quot;6 accounts have already been created from this address.&quot;  I suspect the wiki reads our school firewall/proxy as one address and cut us off at six, even though they were on separate computers.  I would really like each student to have their own log-in, by we may have to come up with another solution.  Any ideas?--[[User:Jsigler|Jsigler]] ([[User talk:Jsigler|talk]]) 15:41, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, the software will cut you off at six per minute. You should be able to continue creating accounts after the minute is up. If not, an admin (like me) can create accounts for you and email you the information. (We can create accounts at an unlimited rate). Let me know if you need to do so. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

==WikiProject name==
Hi Mike, I'm sure your move of the [[Wikibooks:Chess]] page was done in good faith, but as it happens it was not appropriate at this time. I made some remarks to try and explain myself  [[Wikibooks_talk:Wikiprojects|here]]. I'm also not concerned about the history at this stage as the history is basically me attempting to make it look sensible for other and so far it's not a tool of conversation or current to do list, when it is then the history becomes important. If you have any questions or want it explained more, please don't hesitate to ask. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 00:37, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

== Thanks for the welcome ==

Hi Mike, just saw your welcome note; thanks. I'm slowly starting to configure the various account I've staked-out; see [[m:User:Jack Merridew/Matrix]]. I've begun just setting a few preferences and such, and will stub-out a user page when I have time. Wikibooks is probably one I'll focus one more as, well, I read a lot of books.

== External bleeding protocol ==

As an EMT (in the United states), the protocol for [[First Aid/External Bleeding|external bleeding]] is:
# Direct pressure with a dressing
# Elevate
# Apply an additional dressing
# Arterial pressure point
Also, do you think it's worth mentioning that a tourniquet is a '''last resort''' and, in most cases, should never be applied? -- [[User:Macaddct1984|Macaddct1984]] ([[User talk:Macaddct1984|talk]]) 15:29, 10 April 2008 (UTC)
:That's not quite right for lay rescuers. RED is the basics (and technically all that's required). Pressure points/tourniquets are considered a more advanced skill and wouldn't be tested. My experience, however, is that I'll get questions about tourniquets, so I try to preempt them by including it up-front. I think that what's there should be fine, but I'll double-check it. It should be RED with tourniquets/pressure points as an extra in a sidebar. Good to see someone else putting some work into the book! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:53, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

=Introduction=
The MINC file format (Medical Image NetCDF) is based on the NetCDF file
format (Network Common Data Form) distributed by the Unidata Program
Center. NetCDF provides a software interface for storing named,
multi-dimensional variables in files in a machine-independent way. This
interface removes applications from the concerns of portability and file
structure and encourages a self-describing form of data.

Each NetCDF multi-dimensional variable in a file is described by a name,
by its dimensions and by attributes. For example, an image stored in a
file might be stored as byte data in a variable called
''&quot;image&quot;'', with dimensions ''&quot;x&quot;''
and ''&quot;y&quot;'' (each of length 256) and with an attribute
called ''&quot;long_name&quot;'' which is a string describing the
content of the image. Many variables can be stored in one file and each
variable can have many attributes. Dimensions exist independently of
variables and can subscript more than one variable.

MINC provides three things on top of the NetCDF interface. It provides a
standard for dimension, variable and attribute names suitable for medical
imaging, it provides some convenience functions to complement the NetCDF
interface (not specific to the MINC conventions) and it provides
convenience functions for using MINC files.

=An Introduction to NetCDF=
(For a complete description, see the ''NetCDF User's Guide'').

==The NetCDF file==
It is useful to look at an example file while considering the NetCDF
interface. Fortunately, the NetCDF package provides utilities (ncdump
and ncgen) for converting the binary NetCDF files to an ascii format
call CDL. A simple NetCDF file, converted to CDL notation by ncdump,
is given below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  netcdf test {
  dimensions:
  	ycoord = 3 ;
  	xcoord = 4 ;
  
  variables:
  	double image(ycoord, xcoord) ;
  		image:long_name = &quot;My favorite tiny image&quot; ;
  	double xcoord(xcoord) ;
  
  data:
  
   image =
    1, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6, 7, 8,
    9, 10, 11, 12 ;
  
   xcoord = 100, 200, 300, 400 ;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The sample file stores a 3 by 4 image of double precision values. The first
thing defined are the dimensions : ''xcoord'' and
''ycoord''. Dimensions can represent physical dimensions
like x coordinate, y coordinate etc., or they can represent abstract things
like lookup-table index.  Each dimension has a name and a length and when
joined with other dimensions defines the shape of a variable --- the variable
image is subscripted by ''ycoord'' and ''xcoord''.

Dimensions can also be used across variables, relating them to each other.
For example, if the file contained another image also subscripted by
''ycoord'' and ''xcoord'', we would have
the important information that the two variables were sampled on the same
grid.  Also, coordinate systems can be defined by creating variables by the
same name as the dimension, like ''xcoord'' in the example
above, giving the x coordinate of each point in the image.

Variables are the next thing defined in the cdl file. Each variable has a
name, data type and a shape specified by a list of dimensions (up to a
maximum of ''MAX_VAR_DIMS'' = 32 dimensions per variable).
The data types are ''NC_CHAR, NC_BYTE, NC_SHORT, NC_INT,
NC_FLOAT'' and ''NC_DOUBLE''. Information about
each variable is stored in attributes.  The attribute &quot;long_name&quot; gives a
character string describing the variable &quot;image&quot;. Attributes are either
scalars or vectors of one of the six types listed above (a character string
is a vector of type ''NC_CHAR'').

==Programming with NetCDF==
Programming with NetCDF can be quite simple. The file listed above was
produced by the following program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #include &lt;netcdf.h&gt;
  
  #define THE_NAME &quot;My favorite tiny image&quot;
  static double vals[][4]={
     1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
     5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0,
     9.0,10.0,11.0,12.0
  };
  static int ysize=sizeof(vals)/sizeof(vals[0]);
  static int xsize=sizeof(vals[0])/sizeof(vals[0][0]);
  
  static double xcoord[]={100.,200.,300.,400.};
  
  main()
  {
     int cdf, img, xvar;
     int dim[MAX_VAR_DIMS];
     long count[MAX_VAR_DIMS], start[MAX_VAR_DIMS];
  
     /* Create the file */
     cdf=nccreate(&quot;test.cdf&quot;,NC_CLOBBER);
  
     /* Define the dimensions */
     dim[0]=ncdimdef(cdf, &quot;ycoord&quot;, ysize);
     dim[1]=ncdimdef(cdf, &quot;xcoord&quot;, xsize);
  
     /* Define the variables */
     img=ncvardef(cdf, &quot;image&quot;, NC_DOUBLE, 2, dim);
     xvar=ncvardef(cdf,&quot;xcoord&quot;, NC_DOUBLE, 1, &amp;amp;dim[1]);
  
     /* Add an attribute */
     ncattput(cdf, img, &quot;long_name&quot;, NC_CHAR, strlen(THE_NAME)+1, THE_NAME);
  
     /* End definition mode */
     ncendef(cdf);
  
     /* Write the variable values */
     start[0]=start[1]=0;
     count[0]=ysize; count[1]=xsize;
     ncvarput(cdf, img, start, count, vals);
     ncvarput(cdf, xvar, &amp;amp;start[1], &amp;amp;count[1], xcoord);
     ncclose(cdf);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The first executable line of the program creates a new NetCDF file. An open
file is either in ``define'' mode or in ``data'' mode. In define mode,
dimensions, variables and attributes can be defined, but data cannot be
written to or read from variables. In data mode, variable values can be
written or read, but no changes to dimensions or variables can be made and
attributes can only be written if they exist already and will not get larger
with the write. Newly created files are automatically in define mode.

The lines following the call to nccreate define the dimensions and variables
in the file. Notice that the NetCDF file, dimensions and variables are all
identified by an integer returned when they are created. These id's are
subsequently used to refer to each object. The attribute &quot;long_name&quot; for the
image variable is identified only by its name.

Once everything is defined, ncendef puts the file into data mode and values
are written. The values to write are defined by a vector of starting indices
and a vector of the number of values to write in each dimension. This defines
a multi-dimensional rectangle within the variable called a hyperslab. In the
C interface, the first element of the vector refers to the slowest varying
index of the variable, so in this example, the array vals has the
''xcoord'' varying fastest. In the FORTRAN interface, the
convention has the first subscript varying fastest. These conventions follow
the language conventions for multi-dimensional arrays.

=The MINC format=
It is possible to build MINC format files using only NetCDF function calls,
however a C include file is provided to facilitate (and help ensure) adherence
to the standard. This file defines useful constants, standard dimension,
variable and attribute names and some attribute values. It also declares the
functions defined in a library of minc convenience functions, designed to make
an application programmer's life easier.

==The MINC standard==
Various requirements for file formats have been put forward. One such list is
as follows: A protocol should be: 1) simple, 2) self describing, 3)
maintainable, 4) extensible, 5) N dimensional, and 6) have a universal data
structure. The NetCDF format meets all of these requirements, suggesting that
it is a good place to start. I would, however, add some more requirements to
the list. Implied in the above list is the requirement that there be a
standard for accessing data (how do I get the patient name) --- this is not
provided by NetCDF. Furthermore, a useful format should come with a software
interface that makes it easy to use, particularly in a development
environment. Finally, a format that stores many associated pieces of
information should also provide some data organization.

The MINC format attempts to add these things to the NetCDF format.

===MINC variable types===
Medical imaging tends to produce files with a large amount of ancillary
data (patient information, image information, acquisition information,
etc.). To organise this information in a useful fashion, MINC uses
variables to group together related attributes. The variable itself may or
may not contain useful data. For example, the variable
''MIimage'' contains the image data and has attributes
relevant to this data. The variable ''MIpatient'' has no
relevant variable data, but serves to group together all attributes
describing the patient (name, birthdate, etc.). This sort of variable is
called a group variable.

Variables that correspond to dimensions are called dimension variables and
describe the coordinate system corresponding to the dimension. An example
is MIxspace --- both a dimension and a variable describing the x
coordinate of other variables.

The NetCDF conventions allow for these dimension variables to specify the
coordinate at each point, but there is nothing to describe the width of
the sample at that point. MINC provides the convention of dimension width
variables, e.g. ''MIxspace_width'', to give this
information.

Finally, it is possible to have attributes that vary over some of the
dimensions of the variable. For example, if we have a volume of image
data, varying over ''MIxspace'',
''MIyspace'' and ''MIzspace'', we may
want an attribute giving the maximum value of the each image, varying over
''MIzspace''. To achieve this we use a variable, called a
variable attribute, pointed to by an attribute of the image variable.

Thus MINC introduces a number of types of variables: group variables,
dimension variables, dimension width variables and variable attributes.

===Data organization===
MINC attempts to provide some level of data organization through a
hierarchy of group variables. As mentioned above, attributes are grouped
according to type in group variables. Each group variable can have an
''MIparent'' and an ''MIchildren''
attribute --- the former specifying the name of another variable that is
above this one in the hierarchy, the latter specifying a newline-separated
list of variables that come below this one in the hierarchy. At the root
of the hierarchy is the ''MIrootvariable'' variable, with
no parent. Although it is not necessary to make use of this structure, it
can provide a mechanism for ordering large amounts of information.

===MINC dimension variable and attribute names===
The NetCDF format says nothing about variable and dimension naming
conventions and little about attribute names. It does provide a few
standards, such as the attribute &quot;long_name&quot; for describing a variable,
which have been adopted by the MINC standard. MINC defines a set of
standard names for commonly used entities and the include file defines
constants specifying these names. These are described at length in the
MINC reference manual. The most interesting of these is
''MIimage'', the name of the variable used for storing
the actual image data in the file.

===Image dimensions===
The MINC standard gives some special status to the concept of an image.
There is nothing inherent in NetCDF that suggests any special status for
particular dimensions, but it can be convenient to place limitations on
what can vary over which dimensions in an imaging context. For example,
the requirement that the variables that specify how to rescale images (see
later section on pixel values) not vary with image dimensions means that
we can treat the image as a simple unit. In the simplest case, the image
dimensions are simply the two fastest varying dimensions of the
''MIimage'' variable.

It can also be helpful to allow for vector fields --- images or image
volumes that have a vector of values at each point. A simple example of a
vector field is an RGB image. At each point in space, there are three
values: red, green and blue. The dimension
''MIvector_dimension'' is used for the components of the
vector and it should be the fastest varying dimension in the
''MIimage'' variable. If it is present, then the three
fastest varying dimensions of ''MIimage'' are the image
dimensions.

===MINC coordinate system===
The MINC standard defines how spatial coordinates should be oriented
relative to patients. Files are free to have data stored in the desired
direction, but positive world coordinates are given a definite meaning in
the medical imaging context. The standard is that the positive x axis
points from the patient's left to right, the positive y axis points from
posterior to anterior and the positive z axis points from inferior to
superior.

The conversion of element index to world coordinates is done using the
dimension variable attributes ''MIdirection_cosines'',
''MIstep'' and ''MIstart''. If the direction
cosines are  ''c''=(c_x, c_y, c_z), then the vector between
adjacent elements along an axis is step x ''c''. If start(i)
and  ''c''(i) are the ''MIstart'' and
''MIdirection_cosines'' attributes for dimension i (one of
''MIxspace'', ''MIyspace'' and
''MIzspace''), then the first element of the image variable
is at world coordinate \sum_i start(i) ''c''(i). 

If the direction cosines are not present, then they are assumed to be
(1,0,0) for ''MIxspace'', (0,1,0) for
''MIyspace'' and (0,0,1) for
''MIzspace''. Direction cosines are unit vectors and
should be normalized. As well, the step attribute should carry the
information about axis flipping (negative or positive) rather than the
direction cosine.

===Pixel values and real values===
In medical imaging, pixel values are frequently stored as bytes or shorts,
but there is a generally a real value associated with each pixel as well.
This real value is obtained by a scale factor and offset associated with
each image or image volume. The MINC standard indicates how pixel values
should be interpreted. 

Image data in the ''MIimage'' variable can be stored as
bytes, shorts, ints (32-bit), floats or doubles. NetCDF conventions use
the attributes ''MIvalid_range'' or
''MIvalid_max'' and ''MIvalid_min'' to
indicate the range of values that can be found in the variable. For short
values, for example, we might have a valid range of 0 to 32000. To convert
these integers to real values, we could use a scale and offset. However,
these values would have to change if the data where converted to bytes in
the range 23 to 228. 

If we specify an image maximum and minimum to which
''MIvalid_max'' and ''MIvalid_min''
should be mapped by an appropriate scale and offset, then we can convert
type and valid range without having to change the real maximum and
minimum.  To allow the maximum dynamic range in an image, we use the
variables ''MIimagemax'' and
''MIimagemin'' to store the real maximum and minimum ---
these can vary over any of the non-image dimensions of
''MIimage''.

==General convenience functions==
MINC provides a number of convenience functions that have nothing to do with
medical imaging, but that make the use of NetCDF files a little easier. One
of the drawbacks of the NetCDF format is that data can come in any form
(byte, short, int, float, double) and the calling program must handle the
general case. Rather than restrict this, MINC provides functions to convert
types.

The first set of convenience functions are for type conversion.

* &lt;code&gt;miattget&lt;/code&gt; - reads an attribute vector, specifying the numeric type desired and the maximum number of values to read. 
* &lt;code&gt;miattget1&lt;/code&gt; - reads one attribute value of the specified type.
* &lt;code&gt;miattgetstr&lt;/code&gt; - read a character attribute of a specified maximum length.
* &lt;code&gt;miattputdbl&lt;/code&gt; - write a double precision attribute.
* &lt;code&gt;miattputstr&lt;/code&gt; - write a string attribute. 
* &lt;code&gt;mivarget&lt;/code&gt; - get a hyperslab of values of the specified type.
* &lt;code&gt;mivarget1&lt;/code&gt; - get a single value of the specified type.
* &lt;code&gt;mivarput&lt;/code&gt; - put a hyperslab of values of the specified type.
* &lt;code&gt;mivarput1&lt;/code&gt; - put a single value of the specified type.

Next we have some functions for handling coordinate vectors.

* &lt;code&gt;miset_coords&lt;/code&gt; - set a vector of coordinates to a single value.
* &lt;code&gt;mitranslate_coords&lt;/code&gt; - translate the coordinates for one variable to a vector for subscripting another variable.

Finally, there are functions for dealing with variables as groups of
attributes, making it easier to modify a file while keeping ancillary
information.

* &lt;code&gt;micopy_all_atts&lt;/code&gt; - copy all of the attributes of one variable to another (possibly across files).
* &lt;code&gt;micopy_var_def&lt;/code&gt; - copy a variable definition (including attributes) from one file to another.
* &lt;code&gt;micopy_var_vals&lt;/code&gt; - copy a variable's values from one variable to another (possibly across files).
* &lt;code&gt;micopy_all_var_defs&lt;/code&gt; - copy all variable definitions from one file to another, excluding a list of variables.
* &lt;code&gt;micopy_all_var_vals&lt;/code&gt; - copy all variable values from one file to another, excluding a list of variables.

==MINC specific convenience functions==
A few routines are provided to deal with some of the minc structures.
''miattput_pointer'' and ''miattget_pointer'' put/get a pointer to a variable
attribute. ''miadd_child'' helps maintain the hierarchy of variables by handling the ''MIparent''
and ''MIchildren'' attributes of two variables.
Finally ''micreate_std_variable'' and ''micreate_group_variable'' create some of the
standard variables and fill in a few of the default attributes.

==Image conversion variables==
One of the requirements for file formats mentioned earlier was a
software interface to make the interface easy to use. The biggest
difficulty in using a flexible format is that the application must
handle many possibilities. Where images are concerned, this means
various data types and scale factors, and images of differing sizes. The
image conversion variable functions of MINC attempt to remove this
complication for the programmer.

An image conversion variable (icv) is essentially a specification of
what the program wants images to look like, in type, scale and
dimension. When an MINC image is read through an icv, it is converted
for the calling program to a standard format regardless of how data is
stored in the file.

There are two categories of conversion: Type and range conversions
change the datatype (and sign) of image values and optionally scale them
for proper normalization. Dimension conversions allow programs to
specify image dimension size and image axis orientation (should
''MIxspace'' coordinates be increasing or decreasing?
should the patient's left side appear on the left or right of the
image?).

===ICV routines===
Accessing a file through an icv is a straight-forward process. Create
the icv with ''miicv_create'', set properties (like
desired datatype) with the ''miicv_set'' routines,
attach the icv to a NetCDF  variable with
''miicv_attach'' and access the data with
''miicv_get'' or ''miicv_put''. The
icv can be detached from a NetCDF variable with
''miicv_detach'' and can be freed with
''miicv_free''.

Icv properties are strings, integers, long integers or doubles. For
example, ''MI_ICV_SIGN'' (the sign of variable values)
is a string, while ''MI_ICV_IMAGE_MAX'' (image
maximum) is a double precision value.  Four functions ---
''miicv_setint, miicv_setlong, miicv_setdbl'' and
''miicv_setstr'' --- are provided to simplify the
setting of property values. Programs can inquire about property values
with ''miicv_inqint, miicv_inqlong, miicv_inqdbl'' and
''miicv_inqstr''.

===Type and range conversion===
Pixel values are converted for type and sign by specifying values for
the properties ''MI_ICV_TYPE'' and
''MI_ICV_SIGN'' (they default to
''NC_SHORT'' and ''MI_SIGNED'').
Values can also be converted for valid range and for normalization.
These conversions are enabled by setting
''MI_ICV_DO_RANGE'' to ''TRUE'' (the
default).

If ''MI_ICV_DO_NORM'' is ''FALSE''
(the default) then only conversions for valid range are made. This
means that if the input file has shorts in the range 0 to 4095, then
they can be converted to bytes in the range 64 to 248 (for example).
The real image maximum and minimum (''MIimagemax'' and
''MIimagemin'') are ignored. The valid range is
specified by the properties ''MI_ICV_VALID_MAX'' and
''MI_ICV_VALID_MIN'', which default to the legal range
for the type and sign.

We may want to scale values so that they are normalized either to all
values in the ''MIimage'' variable or to some
user-defined range. To do normalization, set
''MI_ICV_DO_NORM'' to ''TRUE''.
Setting ''MI_ICV_USER_NORM'' to
''FALSE'' (the default) causes normalization to the
real maximum and minimum of the variable (the maximum of
''MIimagemax'' and the minimum of
''MIimagemin''). If
''MI_ICV_USER_NORM'' is true then the values of
''MI_ICV_IMAGE_MAX'' and
''MI_ICV_IMAGE_MIN'' are used (defaulting to 1.0 and
0.0).

When either ''MI_ICV_TYPE'' or the file type is
floating-point, then the conversion to and from real values is always
done using the real image maximum and minimum information. If the
internal type is integer and ''MI_ICV_DO_NORM'' is
''FALSE'', then the rescaling is done so that the
slice maximum maps to the valid range of the internal values.

Note that when converting to integer types, values are rounded to the
nearest integer and limited to be within the legal range for the data
type.

The above transformations are simple enough, but the use of
floating-point values adds to the complexity, since in general we do
not want to rescale these values to get the real values. The various
possibilities are described in greater detail below.

===The details of pixel value conversion===
The easiest way to think about the rescaling is through four ranges
(maximum-minimum pairs). In the file variable, values have a valid
range ''var_vrange'' and these correspond to real
values ''var_imgrange''. The user/application wants to
convert real values ''usr_imgrange'' to a useful valid
range ''usr_vrange''. From
''var_vrange'', ''var_imgrange'',
''usr_imgrange'' and ''usr_vrange'',
we can determine a scale and offset for converting pixel values: Input
values are scaled to real values by ''var_vrange'' to
''var_imgrange'' and then scaled again to user values
by ''usr_imgrange'' to
''usr_vrange''.

If either of the ''vrange'' variables are not
specified, they default to maximum possible range for integer types.
For floating point types, ''usr_vrange'' is set equal
to ''usr_imgrange'' so that no conversion of real
values is done. 

If normalization is not being done, then for integer types
''var_imgrange'' and ''usr_imgrange''
are set to [0,1] (scale down to [0,1] and scale up again).  When
normalizibng, ''usr_imgrange'' is set to either the
full range of the variable ([0,1] if not found) or the user's requested
range. If the variable values are floating point, then
''var_imgrange'' is set to
''var_vrange'' (no scaling to real values), otherwise
''var_imgrange'' is read for each image (again, [0,1]
if not found).

What this means for reading and writing images is discussed below.

===Reading with pixel conversion===
When reading into internal floating point values, normalization has no
effect. When reading integers without normalization, each image is
scaled to full range. With normalization they are scaled to the
specified range and slices can be compared.

When the input file is missing either
''MIimagemax''/''MIimagemin''
(''var_imgrange'' information) or
''MIvalid_range'', the routines try to provide
sensible defaults, but funny things can still happen. The biggest
problem is the absence of ''MIvalid_range'' if the
defaults are not correct (full range for integer values and [0,1] for
floating point). When converting floating point values to an integer
type, there will be overflows if values are outside the range [0,1].

===Writing with pixel conversion===
The conversion routines can be used for writing values. This can be
useful for data compression --- e.g. converting internal floats to byte
values in the file, or converting internal shorts to bytes. When doing
this with normalization (to rescale bytes to the slice maximum, for
example) it is important to write the slice maximum and minimum in
''MIimagemax'' and ''MIimagemin''
before writing the slice.

The other concern is that ''MIvalid_range'' or
''MIvalid_max'' and ''MIvalid_min''
be written properly (especially if the defaults are not correct). When
writing floating point values, ''MIvalid_range''
should be set to the full range of values in the variable. In this
case, the attribute does not have to be set correctly before writing
the variable, but if it exists, the values should be reasonable
(maximum greater than minimum and values not likely to cause overflow).
These will be set automatically if the routine
''micreate_std_variable'' is used with
''NC_FILL'' mode on (the default).

===Example Reading values===

''Read an image without normalization''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* Create the icv */
  icv=miicv_create();
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_TYPE, NC_SHORT);
  (void) miicv_setstr(icv, MI_ICV_SIGN, MI_UNSIGNED);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_VALID_MAX, 32000);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_VALID_MIN, 0);
  
  /* Open the file, attach the image variable */
  cdfid=ncopen(filename, NC_NOWRITE);
  
  /* Attach image variable */
  img=ncvarid(cdfid, MIimage);
  (void) miicv_attach(icv, cdfid, img);
  
  /* Get the data - we assume that coord and count are set properly */
  (void) miicv_get(icv, coord, count, image);
  
  /* Close the file and free the icv */
  (void) ncclose(cdfid);
  (void) miicv_free(icv);
&lt;/source&gt;

''Read an image with normalization''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* Create the icv */
  icv=miicv_create();
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_TYPE, NC_SHORT);
  (void) miicv_setstr(icv, MI_ICV_SIGN, MI_UNSIGNED);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_VALID_MAX, 32000);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_VALID_MIN, 0);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_DO_NORM, TRUE);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_USER_NORM, TRUE);
  (void) miicv_setdbl(icv, MI_ICV_IMAGE_MAX, 1.83);
  (void) miicv_setdbl(icv, MI_ICV_IMAGE_MIN, -0.57);
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

''Read a floating point image''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* Create the icv. We don't have to set MI_ICV_USER_NORM to TRUE,
     but doing so ensures that the conversion is done properly
     without looking at file values (the defaults for
     MI_ICV_IMAGE_MAX and MI_ICV_IMAGE_MIN are 1 and 0) */
  icv=miicv_create();
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_TYPE, NC_FLOAT);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_DO_NORM, TRUE);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_USER_NORM, TRUE);
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example Writing values===
''Writing from floating point to byte values''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* Create the icv */
  icv=miicv_create();
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_TYPE, NC_FLOAT);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_DO_NORM, TRUE);
  
  /* Create the file */
  cdf=nccreate(filename, NC_CLOBBER);
  
  /* Define the dimensions */
  dim[0]=ncdimdef(cdf, MIyspace, ysize);
  dim[1]=ncdimdef(cdf, MIxspace, xsize);
  
  /* Define the variables */
  img=micreate_std_variable(cdf, MIimage, NC_BYTE, 2, dim);
  (void) miattputstr(cdf, img, MIsigntype, MI_UNSIGNED);
  vrange[0]=0; vrange[1]=200;
  (void) ncattput(cdf, img, MIvalid_range, NC_DOUBLE, 2, vrange);
  max=micreate_std_variable(cdf, MIimagemax, NC_DOUBLE, 0, NULL);
  min=micreate_std_variable(cdf, MIimagemin, NC_DOUBLE, 0, NULL);
  
  /* End definition mode */
  ncendef(cdf);
  
  /* Attach image variable */
  (void) miicv_attach(icv, cdf, img);
  
  /* Write the image max and min */
  ncvarput1(cdf, max, NULL, &amp;image_maximum);
  ncvarput1(cdf, min, NULL, &amp;image_minimum);
  
  /* Write the image */
  start[0]=start[1]=0;
  count[0]=ysize; count[1]=xsize;
  miicv_put(icv, start, count, vals);
  
  /* Close the file and free the icv */
  (void) ncclose(cdf);
  (void) miicv_free(icv);
&lt;/source&gt;

If we were writing a floating point image, the only difference (apart from
changing ''NC_BYTE'' to ''NC_FLOAT'') would
be that we would rewrite ''MIvalid_range'' at the end of the
file with the full range of floating point values.

===Dimension conversion===
One of the problems of arbitrary dimensioned images is that it becomes
necessary for software to handle the general case. It is easier to write
application software if it is known in advance that all images will have a
specific size (e.g. 256 x 256) and a specific orientation (e.g. the first
pixel is at the patient's anterior, right side). 

By setting the icv property ''MI_ICV_DO_DIM_CONV'' to
''TRUE'' these conversions can be done automatically. The
orientation of spatial axes is determined by the properties
''MI_ICV_XDIM_DIR'', ''MI_ICV_YDIM_DIR'' and
''MI_ICV_ZDIM_DIR''. These affect any image dimensions that
are ''MI?space'' or ''MI?frequency'' where
''?'' corresponds to ''x'',
''y'' or ''z''. These properties can have
values ''MI_ICV_POSITIVE'',
''MI_ICV_NEGATIVE'' or ''MI_ICV_ANYDIR''.
The last of these will prevent flipping of the dimension. The first two will
flip the dimension if necessary so that the attribute
''MIstep'' of the dimension variable will have the correct
sign.

The two image dimensions are referred to as dimensions A and B. Dimension A is
the fastest varying dimension of the two. Setting properties
''MI_ICV_ADIM_SIZE'' and
''MI_ICV_BDIM_SIZE'' specify the desired size for the image
dimension. Dimensions are resized so that the file image will fit entirely in
the calling program's image, and is centred in the image. The size
''MI_ICV_ANYSIZE'' allows one of the dimensions to have a
variable size. If property ''MI_ICV_KEEP_ASPECT'' is set to
''TRUE'', then the two dimensions are rescaled by the same
amount. It is possible to inquire about the new step and start, corresponding
to attributes ''MIstep'' and ''MIstart''
(where pixel position = ipixel*step+start, with ipixel counting
from zero). The properties ''MI_ICV_?DIM_STEP'' and
''MI_ICV_?DIM_START'' (''?'' =
''A'' or ''B'') are set automatically and
can be inquired but not set.

Although vector images are allowed, many applications would rather only deal
with scalar images (one intensity value at each point). Setting
''MI_ICV_DO_SCALAR'' to ''TRUE'' (the
default) will cause vector images to be converted to scalar images by
averaging the components.  (Thus, RGB images are automatically converted to
gray-scale images in this simple way).

It can sometimes be useful for a program to perform dimension conversions on
three (or perhaps more) dimensions, not just the two standard image
dimensions. To perform dimension flipping and/or resizing on dimensions beyond
the usual two, the property ''MI_ICV_NUM_IMGDIMS'' can be set
to an integer value between one and ''MI_MAX_IMGDIMS''. To
set the size of a dimension, set the property
''MI_ICV_DIM_SIZE'' (analogous to
''MI_ICV_ADIM_SIZE''). To specify the dimension to be set,
add the dimension to the property (adding zero corresponds to the fastest
varying dimension --- add zero for the ``A'' dimension, one for the ``B''
dimension, etc.). Voxel separation and location can be inquired about through
the properties ''MI_ICV_DIM_STEP'' and
''MI_ICV_DIM_START'' (analogous to
''MI_ICV_ADIM_STEP'' and
''MI_ICV_ADIM_START''), again adding the dimension number to
the property.

===Example Reading with dimension conversion===
Reading a 256 x 256 image with the first pixel at the patient's inferior,
posterior, left side as short values between 0 and 32000:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* Create the icv */
  icv=miicv_create();
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_TYPE, NC_SHORT);
  (void) miicv_setstr(icv, MI_ICV_SIGN, MI_UNSIGNED);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_VALID_MAX, 32000);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_VALID_MIN, 0);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_DO_DIM_CONV, TRUE);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_ADIM_SIZE, 256);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_BDIM_SIZE, 256);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_KEEP_ASPECT, TRUE);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_XDIM_DIR, MI_POSITIVE);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_YDIM_DIR, MI_POSITIVE);
  (void) miicv_setint(icv, MI_ICV_ZDIM_DIR, MI_POSITIVE);
  
  /* Open the file, attach the image variable */
  cdfid=ncopen(filename, NC_NOWRITE);
  
  /* Attach image variable */
  img=ncvarid(cdfid, MIimage);
  (void) miicv_attach(icv, cdfid, img);
  
  /* Get the data - we assume that coord and count are set properly */
  (void) miicv_get(icv, coord, count, image);
  
  /* Close the file and free the icv */
  (void) ncclose(cdfid);
  (void) miicv_free(icv);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Authorship ==

I've added the two people you've mentioned in your edits so far to [[MINC/Authors]], using a template to keep their email addresses from being harvested by spam bots.  I should note that it's not normally appropriate to designate a page as &quot;created by&quot;, as it intimidates new editors into thinking that someone &quot;owns&quot; a page (how could that be so on a freely-editable wiki), which would discourage them from trying to make improvements, for fear of angering the original creator. What you could do is mention their names in the edit summary text field when creating the page, which will be present in the page's history for all time, providing attribution without discouraging newcomers. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:53, 29 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

=Dimension variable and attribute names=
Of all of the variables, dimensions and attributes described here, only the variable
&lt;code&gt;MIimage&lt;/code&gt; and its dimensions are required to be present in a MINC file.
Additional variables, dimensions and attributes may be present in the file -- unrecognised
variables and attributes should be ignored.

A word on attribute conventions. All numeric values should be stored in one of the numeric
types (&lt;code&gt;NC_BYTE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NC_SHORT&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;NC_INT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NC_FLOAT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NC_DOUBLE&lt;/code&gt;).
Some numeric attributes must be specified in a definite unit -- time attributes (such as
&lt;code&gt;MIrepetition_time&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MIradionuclide_halflife&lt;/code&gt;)  are
given in seconds. Other attributes have an associated attribute that gives the unit -- e.g.
&lt;code&gt;MIinjection_dose&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MIdose_units&lt;/code&gt;.

==NetCDF standard attributes==
These attributes can be used with any variable. Fuller descriptions can be obtained from
the NetCDF user's guide.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIunits
&lt;/source&gt;

Specifies the units of the variable values as a string -- units should be compatible with
the udunits library.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIlong_name
&lt;/source&gt;

A string giving a textual description of the variable for human consumption.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIvalid_range
&lt;/source&gt;

A vector of two numbers specifying the minimum and maximum valid values in the variable.
For the MINC routines the order is not important. For the &lt;code&gt;MIimage&lt;/code&gt;
variable, this attribute (or &lt;code&gt;MIvalid_max&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;MIvalid_min&lt;/code&gt;) should always be present unless the defaults of full
range for integer types and [0.0,1.0] for floating point types is correct.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIvalid_max
&lt;/source&gt;

A number giving the valid maximum for the variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIvalid_min
&lt;/source&gt;

A number giving the valid minimum for the variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MI_FillValue
&lt;/source&gt;

Number to be used for filling in values in the variable that are not explicitly written.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MItitle
&lt;/source&gt;

A global string that provides a description of what is in the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIhistory
&lt;/source&gt;

A global string that should store one line for each program that has modified the file.
Each line should contain the program name and arguments.

==MINC general attributes==
These attributes apply to any variable in the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIvartype
&lt;/source&gt;

A string identifying the type of variable. Should be one of &lt;code&gt;MI_GROUP&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;MI_DIMENSION&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MI_DIM_WIDTH&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;MI_VARATT&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIvarid
&lt;/source&gt;

A string that identifies the origin of the variable. All standard MINC variables should
have this attribute with value &lt;code&gt;MI_STDVAR&lt;/code&gt;. Variables created by users
should have a distinctive name that will not be the same as the names used by other
applications.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIsigntype
&lt;/source&gt;

The NetCDF format does not need to know the sign of variables since it does not interpret
values -- it is left up to the invoking program to worry about the signs of integers.
Because the MINC interface translates variables, it must have this information.
&lt;code&gt;MIsigntype&lt;/code&gt; is a string with value &lt;code&gt;MI_SIGNED&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;MI_UNSIGNED&lt;/code&gt;. The default values are &lt;code&gt;MI_UNSIGNED&lt;/code&gt;
for bytes and &lt;code&gt;MI_SIGNED&lt;/code&gt; for all other types.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIparent
&lt;/source&gt;

A string identifying by name the parent variable of this variable (either in the data
hierarchy or as the parent of this variable attribute).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIchildren
&lt;/source&gt;

A newline-separated list of the children of this variable (in the data hierarchy).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIcomments
&lt;/source&gt;

Any text that should be included with this variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIversion
&lt;/source&gt;

A string identifying the file version. The current version is
&lt;code&gt;MI_CURRENT_VERSION&lt;/code&gt;. Each version can be identified by a constant of
the form &lt;code&gt;MI_VERSION_1_0&lt;/code&gt;.

The constants &lt;code&gt;MI_TRUE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MI_FALSE&lt;/code&gt; are provided
for boolean attributes.

==Dimensions and dimension variable==
The following are the names of dimensions and their corresponding dimension variables. Only
&lt;code&gt;MIvector_dimension&lt;/code&gt; does not have a corresponding dimension variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIxspace
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for x axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIyspace
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for y axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIzspace
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for z axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MItime
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate for variable time axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MItfrequency
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for temporal frequency.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIxfrequency
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for spatial  frequency along the x axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIyfrequency
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for spatial frequency along the y axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIzfrequency
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension and coordinate variable for spatial frequency along the z axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIvector_dimension
&lt;/source&gt;

Dimension only for components of a vector field.

In addition to dimension variables, we can have dimension width variables that specify the
FWHM width of the sample at each point.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIxspace_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along x axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIyspace_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along y axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIzspace_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along z axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MItime_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along time axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MItfrequency_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along temporal frequency axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIxfrequency_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along x spatial frequency axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIyfrequency_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along y spatial frequency axis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIzfrequency_width
&lt;/source&gt;

Width of samples along z spatial frequency axis.

The attributes associated with dimension and dimension width variables are given below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIspacing
&lt;/source&gt;

A string with value &lt;code&gt;MI_REGULAR&lt;/code&gt; (for a regularly spaced grid) or
&lt;code&gt;MI_IRREGULAR&lt;/code&gt; (for irregular spacing of samples). If the value is
&lt;code&gt;MI_REGULAR&lt;/code&gt;, then the variable is permitted to be a scalar instead of a
vector varying with the dimension of the same name. Can be used for both dimension and
dimension width variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIstep
&lt;/source&gt;

A number indicating the step between samples for regular spacing. This value may be
negative to indicate orientation (to specify that &lt;code&gt;MIxspace&lt;/code&gt; runs from
patient right to left, for example). If the spacing is irregular, then the value can be an
average step size. Applies only to dimension variables. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIstart
&lt;/source&gt;

The coordinate of the index 0 of the dimension. Applies only to dimension variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIspacetype
&lt;/source&gt;

A string identifying the type of coordinate space. Currently one of
&lt;code&gt;MI_NATIVE&lt;/code&gt; (the coordinate system of the scanner),
&lt;code&gt;MI_TALAIRACH&lt;/code&gt; (a standardized coordinate system), or
&lt;code&gt;MI_CALLOSAL&lt;/code&gt; (another standardized coordinate system). Applies only to
dimension variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIalignment
&lt;/source&gt;

A string indicating the position of the coordinates relative to each sample (remembering
that each sample has a width). Can be one of &lt;code&gt;MI_START&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;MI_CENTRE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MI_END&lt;/code&gt;. Applies only to dimension
variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIdirection_cosines
&lt;/source&gt;

A vector with &lt;code&gt;MI_NUM_SPACE_DIMS&lt;/code&gt;(=3) elements giving the direction
cosines of the axes. Although axes are labelled x, y and z, they may in fact have a
signficantly different direction -- this attribute allows the direction relative to the
true axes to be specified exactly. Applies only to dimension variables. Note that the dot
product of the direction cosine with the corresponding axis &lt;function&gt;(1,0,0), (0,1,0) or
(0,0,1)&lt;/function&gt; should be positive so that the sign of the attribute
&lt;code&gt;MIstep&lt;/code&gt; contains the orientation information.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIwidth
&lt;/source&gt;

For regularly dimension widths, this numeric attribute gives the FWHM width of all samples.
It can be used for irregular widths to specify the average width. Applies only to dimension
width variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIfiltertype
&lt;/source&gt;

A string specifying the shape of the convolving filter. Currently, can be one of
&lt;code&gt;MI_SQUARE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MI_GAUSSIAN&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;MI_TRIANGULAR&lt;/code&gt;. Applies only to dimension width variables.

==Root variable==
The variable &lt;code&gt;MIrootvariable&lt;/code&gt; is used as the root of the data hierarchy,
with its &lt;code&gt;MIchildren&lt;/code&gt; attribute pointing to the first level of group
variables (including all of the MINC group variables), and with its
&lt;code&gt;MIparent&lt;/code&gt; attribute an empty string.

==Image variable==
The variable &lt;code&gt;MIimage&lt;/code&gt; is used to store the image data.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIimagemax
&lt;/source&gt;

A variable attribute (ie. an attribute pointing to a variable of the same name) that stores
the real value maximum for the image. This variable should not vary over the image
dimensions of MIimage. The units of this variable define the units of the image.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIimagemin
&lt;/source&gt;

Like &lt;code&gt;MIimagemax&lt;/code&gt;, but stores the real value minimum for the image.
&lt;code&gt;MIimagemax&lt;/code&gt; should not be present without
&lt;code&gt;MIimagemin&lt;/code&gt; and vice-versa.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

=NetCDF routines=
Because it is necessary to use NetCDF routines to access MINC files, a brief description of
all NetCDF routines is provided here. For more information, see the NetCDF User's Guide.
Note that the header file netcdf.h is automatically included by the header file minc.h.

==Error handling==
If an error occurs, the default behaviour is to print an error message and exit. It is
possible to change this behaviour by modifying the value of the global variable ncopts. The
default setting is

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ncopts = NC_VERBOSE | NC_FATAL;
&lt;/source&gt;

which means print error messages and exit when an error occurs. To get error messages
without having fatal errors, set 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ncopts = NC_VERBOSE;
&lt;/source&gt;

For neither error messages nor fatal errors, set

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ncopts = 0;
&lt;/source&gt;

In these last two cases, the calling routine should check the function value returned by
each call to a NetCDF function. All routines return an integer value. If the value is
&lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;MI_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;), then an error has occurred. The
value of the global variable &lt;code&gt;ncerr&lt;/code&gt; gives more information on the type
of error (see file &lt;code&gt;netcdf.h&lt;/code&gt; for error codes).

==NetCDF file operations==
&lt;code&gt;nccreate&lt;/code&gt; : Create the file specified by &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;. The
argument &lt;code&gt;cmode&lt;/code&gt; must have a  value of either
&lt;code&gt;NC_CLOBBER&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NC_NOCLOBBER&lt;/code&gt;. The return value is
an identifier for the NetCDF file and is used by subsequent NetCDF function calls.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int nccreate(char* path,int cmode);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncopen&lt;/code&gt; : Open the file specified by &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; must have value  &lt;code&gt;NC_NOWRITE&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;NC_WRITE&lt;/code&gt;. The return value is a NetCDF file identifier.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncopen(char* path,int mode);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncredef&lt;/code&gt; : Put an open file into define mode. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncredef(int cdfid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncendef&lt;/code&gt; : Put file into data mode. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncendef(int cdfid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncclose&lt;/code&gt; : Close a NetCDF file. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncclose(int cdfid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncinquire&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about the number of dimensions in a file, the
number of  variables, the number of global attributes or the id of the unlimited record
dimension. Passing a NULL value for any of the pointers means do not return the associated
value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncinquire(int cdfid,int* ndims,int* nvars,int* natts,int* recdim);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncsync&lt;/code&gt; : Synchronize an open file to disk. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncsync(int cdfid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncabort&lt;/code&gt; : Abort any changes to the file if it is in define mode. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncabort(int cdfid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncsetfill&lt;/code&gt; : When &lt;code&gt;ncendef&lt;/code&gt; is called, all variables
are filled with a fill value by default. To turn this off, call this routine with
&lt;code&gt;fillmode&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;NC_NOFILL&lt;/code&gt; (to turn it back on,
use &lt;code&gt;NC_FILL&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncsetfill(int cdfid,int fillmode);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Dimension operations==
&lt;code&gt;ncdimdef&lt;/code&gt; : Define a dimension with a name and a length. The return
value is a  dimension id to be used in subsequent calls.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncdimdef(int cdfid,char* name,long length);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncdimid&lt;/code&gt; : Get a dimension id from a name. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncdimid(int cdfid,char* name);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncdiminq&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about a dimension (name or length). 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncdiminq(int cdfid,int dimid,char* name,long* length);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncdimrename&lt;/code&gt; : Rename a dimension. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncvarid(int cdfid,char* name);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncvarinq&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about a variable. Any NULL pointers mean do not
return the  associated value. It is possible to get the variable name, type, number of
dimensions, dimension id's and number of attributes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncvarinq(int cdfid,int varid,char* name,nc_type* datatype,int* ndims,
                 int dim[],int* natts);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncvarput1&lt;/code&gt; : Store a single value at the coordinate specified by
&lt;code&gt;coords&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; must be of the correct data type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncvarput1(int cdfid,int varid,long coords[],void* value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncvarget1&lt;/code&gt; : Get a single value from the coordinate specified by
coords.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncvarget1(int cdfid,int varid,long coords[],void* value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncvarput&lt;/code&gt; : Put a hyperslab (multi-dimensional rectangle) of values
starting at  &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; with edge lengths given by
&lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. For the C interface, the last dimension varies fastest. Values
must be of the correct type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncvarput(int cdfid,int varid,long start[],long count[],void* value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncvarget&lt;/code&gt; : Get a hyperslab (multi-dimensional rectangle) of values
starting at  &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; with edge lengths given by
&lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. For the C interface, the last dimension varies fastest. Values
must be of the correct type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncvarget(int cdfid,int varid,long start[],long count[],void* value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncvarrename&lt;/code&gt; : Rename a variable. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int nctypelen(nc_type datatype);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Attribute operations==
&lt;code&gt;ncattput&lt;/code&gt; : Store an attribute by name with variable
&lt;code&gt;varid&lt;/code&gt;. The type and  length of the attribute must be specified.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncattput(int cdfid,int varid,char* name,nc_type datatype,int len,
                void* value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncattinq&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about an attribute by name. Can get either type or
length. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncattinq(int cdfid,int varid,char* name,nc_type* datatype,int* len);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncattget&lt;/code&gt; : Get an attribute's value by name. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncattget(int cdfid,int varid,char* name,void* value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncattname&lt;/code&gt; : Get the name of an attribute from its number. The number
is not an id,  but can change as the number of attributes associated with a variable
changes. Attribute numbers run from 0 to natts-1.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncattname(int cdfid,int varid,int attnum,char* name);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncattrename&lt;/code&gt; : Rename an attribute. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncattrename(int cdfid,int varid,char* name,char* newname);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;ncattdel&lt;/code&gt; : Delete an attribute. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int ncattdel(int cdfid,int varid,char* name);
&lt;/source&gt;

=MINC routines=
Error handling for MINC routines is the same as for NetCDF functions, with the exception that
routines returning pointers will return &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; instead of
&lt;code&gt;MI_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; when an error occurs. Error codes (returned in
&lt;code&gt;ncerr&lt;/code&gt;) can be found in the header file minc.h.

==General convenience functions==
&lt;code&gt;miexpand_file&lt;/code&gt; : Routine to expand a minc file that has been compressed
with compress, pack, gzip or zip (using gunzip, zcat or pcat). The name of the temporary
minc file is returned -- this string must be freed by the caller. If the file specified by
&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; is not compressed, then its name is returned.
&lt;code&gt;*create_tempfile&lt;/code&gt; is set to TRUE if a temporary file is created (and
the caller needs to delete the file), FALSE if the original file name is returned. If
tempfile is NULL, then the routine generates its own temporary file name, otherwise, the
user provided name is used. If &lt;code&gt;header_only&lt;/code&gt; is TRUE, then the routine
will expand only enough of the file to read the header.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public char *miexpand_file(char *path, char *tempfile, int header_only, 
                             int *created_tempfile);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miopen&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;ncopen&lt;/code&gt;, but will temporarily
uncompress files (compress, pack, gzip, zip) opened with mode 
&lt;code&gt;NC_NOWRITE&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miopen(char *path, int mode);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;micreate&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;nccreate&lt;/code&gt;. May be enhanced in the
future.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int micreate(char *path, int cmode);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miclose&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;ncclose&lt;/code&gt;, but finishes up for
&lt;code&gt;miopen&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;micreate&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miclose(int cdfid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattget&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;ncattget&lt;/code&gt;, but the caller
specifies the desired numeric type and maximum number of values to get. Type is specified
with &lt;code&gt;datatype&lt;/code&gt; (the sign is the default for the type:
&lt;code&gt;MI_UNSIGNED&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;NC_BYTE&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;MI_SIGNED&lt;/code&gt; otherwise). &lt;code&gt;max_length&lt;/code&gt; gives the
maximum number of values to get and &lt;code&gt;att_length&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of
values actually read. An error will occur if the attribute type is not numeric.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miattget(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, nc_type datatype,
                      int max_length, void *value, int *att_length);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattget1&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;miattget&lt;/code&gt;, but only one value is
returned. If there is more than one value, an error occurs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miattget1(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, nc_type datatype,
                      void *value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattgetstr&lt;/code&gt; : Gets a string value from an attribute.
&lt;code&gt;maxlen&lt;/code&gt; gives the maximum number of characters to be returned
(including the terminating &lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt;). The string is written to the array
specified by value and a pointer to the string is returned.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public char *miattgetstr(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, 
                           int maxlen, char *value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattputint&lt;/code&gt; : Write an integer attribute.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miattputint(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, int value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattputdbl&lt;/code&gt; : Write a double precision attribute.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miattputdbl(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, double value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattputstr&lt;/code&gt; : Write a string attribute.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miattputstr(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, char *value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;mivarget&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;ncvarget&lt;/code&gt;, but the caller
specifies the desired numeric type and sign (either &lt;code&gt;MI_SIGNED&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;MI_UNSIGNED&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int mivarget(int cdfid, int varid, long start[], long count[],
                      nc_type datatype, char *sign, void *values);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;mivarget1&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;ncvarget1&lt;/code&gt;, but the caller
specifies the desired numeric type and sign.

dimensions, but not necessarily the same order of dimensions. If &lt;code&gt;invar&lt;/code&gt;
has a dimension that is not in &lt;code&gt;outvar&lt;/code&gt;, then the corresponding
coordinate is ignored. If &lt;code&gt;outvar&lt;/code&gt; has a dimension that is not in

==MINC specific convenience functions==
&lt;code&gt;miget_datatype&lt;/code&gt; : Get the type and sign information for an image
variable. Signed data is indicated by setting &lt;code&gt;is_signed&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;; unsigned by &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;miget_default_range&lt;/code&gt; : Returns the default range for a specified type
and sign.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miget_valid_range&lt;/code&gt; : Gets the valid range information for an image
variable. This function handles potential type differences between the
&lt;code&gt;valid_range&lt;/code&gt; attribute and the image data. These differences
(particularly float images with double &lt;code&gt;valid_range&lt;/code&gt;) could otherwise
lead to problems in properly identifying invalid data.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miget_valid_range(int cdfid, int imgid, double valid_range[]);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miset_valid_range&lt;/code&gt; : Sets the valid range information for an image
variable. This function follows the NetCDF convention of having both variable data and
&lt;code&gt;valid_range&lt;/code&gt; attribute with the same type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miset_valid_range(int cdfid, int imgid, double valid_range[]);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miget_image_range&lt;/code&gt; : Gets the maximum real range of the image data
based on the image-min and image-max variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miget_image_range(int cdfid, double image_range[]);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;mivar_exists&lt;/code&gt; : Tests for the existence of a variable. Returns true if
the variable exists.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int mivar_exists(int cdfid, char *varname);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miattput_pointer&lt;/code&gt; : Create an attribute &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; in
the variable &lt;code&gt;varid&lt;/code&gt; that points to the variable
&lt;code&gt;ptrvarid&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miattput_pointer(int cdfid, int varid, char *name, int ptrvarid);

&lt;code&gt;child_varid&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;MIchildren&lt;/code&gt; attribute of
variable &lt;code&gt;parent_varid&lt;/code&gt; and set the &lt;code&gt;MIparent&lt;/code&gt;
attribute of variable &lt;code&gt;child_varid&lt;/code&gt; to the name of variable
&lt;code&gt;parent_varid&lt;/code&gt;. If the attributes do not exist, they are created. The
names in the attribute &lt;code&gt;MIchildren&lt;/code&gt; are separated by newlines.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miadd_child(int cdfid, int parent_varid, int child_varid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;micreate_std_variable&lt;/code&gt; : Create any of the standard MINC variables and
set some attributes. Called in the manner of &lt;code&gt;ncvardef&lt;/code&gt;. The id of the
newly created variable is returned. For all variables, attributes
&lt;code&gt;MIvarid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MIvartype&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;MIversion&lt;/code&gt; are all set. For dimension and dimension width variables,
&lt;code&gt;MIspacing&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;MI_REGULAR&lt;/code&gt; if the number of
dimensions is zero and &lt;code&gt;MI_IRREGULAR&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. For dimension
variables, &lt;code&gt;MIalignment&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;MI_CENTRE&lt;/code&gt; unless
the variable is &lt;code&gt;MItime&lt;/code&gt;, then it is set to
&lt;code&gt;MI_START&lt;/code&gt;. As well,  MIcomments is set to a string describing the
direction of the world coordinates of spatial dimensions. For dimension width variables,
&lt;code&gt;MIfiltertype&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;MI_SQUARE&lt;/code&gt;. For
&lt;code&gt;MIimage&lt;/code&gt; and for &lt;code&gt;MIimagemax&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;MIimagemin&lt;/code&gt;, dimensions are checked to ensure that the last two do not
vary over image dimensions and attribute pointers from &lt;code&gt;MIimage&lt;/code&gt; are
created to point to the other two.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int micreate_std_variable(int cdfid, char *name, nc_type datatype, 
                                   int ndims, int dim[]);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;micreate_group_variable&lt;/code&gt; : Like
&lt;code&gt;micreate_std_variable&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;ndims&lt;/code&gt; is always set to
zero and the datatype is &lt;code&gt;NC_INT&lt;/code&gt;. The id of the newly created variable
is returned.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int micreate_group_variable(int cdfid, char *name);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Image conversion variable functions==
&lt;code&gt;miicv_create&lt;/code&gt; : Create an image conversion variable and set the
defaults -- an icv identifier is returned for later use (or &lt;code&gt;MI_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;
if an error occurs). The old limit of &lt;code&gt;MI_MAX_NUM_ICV&lt;/code&gt; icv's that can
exist at one time has been removed, although the definition remains.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miicv_create();

  public int miicv_setdbl(int icvid, int icv_property, double value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_setint&lt;/code&gt; : Set a numeric icv property to an integer value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miicv_setint(int icvid, int icv_property, int value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_setlong&lt;/code&gt; : Set a numeric icv property to a long integer value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miicv_setlong(int icvid, int icv_property, long value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_setstr&lt;/code&gt; : Set a string icv property.

  public int miicv_set(int icvid, int icv_property, char *value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_inqdbl&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about a numeric icv property.

  public int miicv_inqdbl(int icvid, int icv_property, double *value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_inqint&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about a numeric icv property.

&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_inqstr&lt;/code&gt; : Inquire about a string icv property.
&lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; points to the character array in which the value should be
returned. The calling routine must allocate enough space for the return string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miicv_inqstr(int icvid, int icv_property, char *value);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_attach&lt;/code&gt; : Attach a MINC file and image variable to an icv. Note
that icv properties cannot be modified while a variable is attached to the icv. If a
variable is already attached to the icv, then it is automatically detached. The file
&lt;code&gt;icvid&lt;/code&gt; must be in data mode.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miicv_attach(int icvid, int cdfid, int varid);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;miicv_ndattach&lt;/code&gt; : Like &lt;code&gt;miicv_attach&lt;/code&gt; but no
dimension conversion facilities are available (much like setting
&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_DO_DIM_CONV&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;). This avoids linking
in all of the dimension conversion routines when they are not needed (for machines where
memory may be a concern).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public int miicv_ndattach(int icvid, int cdfid, int varid);

&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_DIM_START&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;) : Read-only property
that gives the equivalent of attribute &lt;code&gt;MIstart&lt;/code&gt; for an image dimension
after dimension conversion. The number of the dimension to be queried should be added to the
property (adding zero corresponds to the fastest varying dimension). 

&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_NUM_DIMS&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) : Read-only property that
gives the number of dimensions of the image variable, taking into account the conversion of
vector images into scalar images.

&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_CDFID&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) : Read-only property that
gives the id of the currently attached NetCDF file, or &lt;code&gt;MI_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; if no
file is attached.

&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_VARID&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) : Read-only property that
gives the id of the currently attached NetCDF variable, or &lt;code&gt;MI_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; if
no variable is attached.

&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_MAXVAR&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;) : String property
specifying the name of the variable that gives the image maximum.  Default =
&lt;code&gt;MIimagemax&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_MINVAR&lt;/code&gt; (type &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;) : String property
specifying the name of the variable that gives the image minimum.  Default =
&lt;code&gt;MIimagemin&lt;/code&gt;.

=Known bugs=
For dimension conversion with image conversion variables, the values of
&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_DIM_START&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_ADIM_START&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;MI_ICV_BDIM_START&lt;/code&gt; are computed assuming that
&lt;code&gt;MIalignment&lt;/code&gt; is equal to &lt;code&gt;MI_CENTRE&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This document describes a library of routines available at the McConnell Brain
Imaging Centre (BIC) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. It was developed
as part of a medical imaging software testbed by David MacDonald, with source
code and considerable input from Peter Neelin, Louis Collins, and others at
the Centre.

The library, which is referred to as the BIC Volume IO Library, comprises a
set of functions for reading and writing volumes of medical imaging data, as
well as some general support routines useful to many programming tasks. 
Images at the Brain Imaging Centre are stored on disk in a format called
''MINC'', which stands for ''Medical Image Net
CDF''.  More information  is available in related documentation
specifically concerning this format and the MINC library of routines used to
read and write MINC files.

The BIC Volume IO Library  is built on top of the MINC library to provide easy
access to MINC files for most general operations, without having to learn too
much of the details of the MINC library, which is a comprehensive system for
handling most conceivable cases.  The BIC Volume IO Library  provides a
structure for internal storage of volumes and routines to access and modify
volumes.  In addition, it provides routines to manipulate tag points and
transformations and to perform input and output on these objects in the
standardized formats of the Brain Imaging Centre.

This document describes where to find the BIC Volume IO Library, what
functionality is provided, and how to integrate it into a user's programs. The
library is written in C source code, and is designed to be linked with C
source.  It makes calls to two other libraries: &lt;code&gt;MINC&lt;/code&gt; (the
BIC file format library) and &lt;code&gt;netcdf&lt;/code&gt; (a portable file
format manager).

=Compiling and Linking=
The library for linking is &lt;code&gt;libvolume_io.a&lt;/code&gt;, which is in
&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/code&gt;, and the related include files are in the
directory, &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/include&lt;/code&gt; under
&lt;code&gt;volume_io&lt;/code&gt;.  Both directories are usually in the compiler
search path. Source files making calls to Volume IO functions must have the
following line at the top, to include the relevant type definitions and
prototypes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #include  &lt;volume_io/volume_io.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to link with BIC Volume IO Library, the relevant libraries must be
specified:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  cc test_volume_io.o  -o test_volume_io \
             -lvolume_io -lminc -lnetcdf -lm -lmalloc
&lt;/source&gt;

The two libraries, &lt;code&gt;minc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;netcdf&lt;/code&gt;
are usually in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/code&gt;, which is automatically in
the search path.  The &lt;code&gt;-lm&lt;/code&gt; option includes the math
library, which is sometimes called by the BIC Volume IO Library. The
&lt;code&gt;-lmalloc&lt;/code&gt; library provides faster and more robust memory
allocation than the default.

=Style=
In order to use this library, one must become accustomed to certain subtleties
of style, some of which are peculiar to the author of this software and some
of which have evolved in ways dependent on history of the software. 
Therefore, it is important to note the following style-related issues, for
which no apologies are forthcoming.

==Global Variables==
The philosophy that global variables are generally a bad idea has been
adopted.  In many cases, using global variables within functions hides the
behaviour of a function, and therefore, it is preferable to specify all
relevant information to a function in the argument list, rather than
relying on any global variables.  Secondly, modification of a global
variable by a given function precludes the use of this function in a
multi-threaded environment (two processes may attempt to modify the global
variable at the same time).  As a result of adopting the anti-global
variable philosophy, the user of the BIC Volume IO Library  often must
specify many arguments to a function.  This seems a small price to pay, in
return for the ability to see all factors controlling the behaviour of each
function in the argument list.

==Identifier Names==
The implementer of this library has an affinity to typing large amounts of
text, and generally dislikes abbreviations.  As a result, the function and
variable names occurring in the BIC Volume IO Library  may be quite
verbose, almost to the point of being complete grammatically correct
sentences.  In general, one will never see functions with names such as
&lt;code&gt;rem_garb()&lt;/code&gt;.  Instead, functions are more likely to
have names such as &lt;code&gt;remove_garbage()&lt;/code&gt;, and, in many
cases, even &lt;code&gt;take_garbage_to_curb()&lt;/code&gt;.  As a result, the
user of the BIC Volume IO Library will have to type longer-than-usual
function and variable names, but hopefully will have a clearer insight into
the associated functionality.

==Structure Arguments==
There are many objects defined throughout the library as structures of
varying and possibly large sizes.  Due to the inefficiency of passing
structures by value (copying the whole structure to a function), structures
are generally passed to functions by reference.  Because of this, there is
always a potential to pass an invalid pointer to a function which expects a
pointer to a structure.  The following examples illustrate the right and
wrong ways to use such a function.  Given a structure and a library
function which initializes it,

''The correct method of using this function''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  typedef  struct
  {
      int   a, b, c, d;
  } big_struct;
  
  void    initialize( struct  big_struct   *s )
  {
      s-&gt;a = 1;   s-&gt;b = 2;   s-&gt;c = 3;    s-&gt;d = 4;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

''The incorrect method of using this function''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int  main()
  {
      big_struct   *s;
  
      initialize( s );   /* WRONG */
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

because the variable &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is an uninitialized pointer. 
The correct method is to define a structure variable, not a pointer to a
structure, and pass a pointer to the structure:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  int  main()
  {
      big_struct   s;
  
      initialize( &amp;s );
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternately, the incorrect example above could have been corrected by
allocating the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; pointer before calling
&lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt;.

=Types and Macros=
There are several types and macros defined for use with the BIC Volume IO
Library. All function declarations in the library are preceded with either the
word &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, which
indicates whether the function is accessible from outside the file in which it
resides. Users of the library will only be interested in those functions
preceded by &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;.  They are defined as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #define  public
          #define  private   static
&lt;/source&gt;

A type for logical values is defined:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  typedef  int    BOOLEAN
          #define  FALSE  0
          #define  TRUE   1
          #define  OFF    FALSE
          #define  ON     TRUE
&lt;/source&gt;

Other useful types defined include:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  typedef  double             Real;
          typedef  enum 
               { OK, ERROR, INTERNAL_ERROR, END_OF_FILE, QUIT }
                                      Status;
          typedef  char               Smallest_int;
&lt;/source&gt;

Some macros useful for general programming include:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  N_DIMENSIONS
&lt;/source&gt;

A constant equal to 3, the number of dimensions in the real world.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  X
&lt;/source&gt;

A constant equal to 0, used as an index into various XYZ structures.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  Y
&lt;/source&gt;

A constant equal to 1, used as an index into various XYZ structures.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  Z
&lt;/source&gt;

A constant equal to 2, used as an index into various XYZ structures.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  SIZEOF_STATIC_ARRAY( array )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the number of elements in a statically allocated array, for example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  {
              int  size;
              int  array[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
  
              size = SIZEOF_STATIC_ARRAY( array );     /* == 3 */
          }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ROUND( x )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the nearest integer to the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.  If halfway in
between two integers, returns the higher of the two.  Works correctly
for negative, zero, and positive numbers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  IS_INT( x )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the real argument is exactly an integer.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  FRACTION( x )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the fractional part of the argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  FLOOR( x )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the largest integer less than or equal to the argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  CEILING( x )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ABS( x )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the absolute value of an integer or real.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MAX( x, y )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the maximum of two integers or reals.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MAX3( x, y, z )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the maximum of three integers or reals.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIN( x, y )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the minimum of two integers or reals.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  MIN3( x, y, z )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the minimum of three integers or reals.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  INTERPOLATE( alpha, a, b )
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the interpolation between &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;,
where &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; is in the range zero to one.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  PI
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the value of &amp;Pi;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  DEG_TO_RAD
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the number of radians per degrees,
used to multiply an angle in degrees to result in radians.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  RAD_TO_DEG
&lt;/source&gt;

returns the number of degrees per radian,
used to multiply an angle in radians to result in degrees.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  IJ( i, j, nj )
&lt;/source&gt;

converts the indices &lt;code&gt;[i, j]&lt;/code&gt; of a 2-D &lt;code&gt;ni&lt;/code&gt; by
&lt;code&gt;nj&lt;/code&gt; array into a single index, based on row-major order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  IJK( i, j, k, nj, nk )
&lt;/source&gt;

converts the indices &lt;code&gt;[i, j, k]&lt;/code&gt; of a 3-D &lt;code&gt;ni&lt;/code&gt; by
&lt;code&gt;nj&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;nk&lt;/code&gt; array into a single index, based on
row-major order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  for_less( i, start, end )
&lt;/source&gt;

performs a for loop where &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; starts at &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;
and increments until it is greater than or equal to &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;. 

Equivalent to &lt;code&gt;for( i = start;  i &lt; end; ++i )&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  for_inclusive( i, start, end )
&lt;/source&gt;

performs a for loop where &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; starts at &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;
and increments until it is greater than &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;. 

Equivalent to &lt;code&gt;for( i = start;  i &lt;= end; ++i )&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLUE(x,y)
&lt;/source&gt;

Special C source macro to stick two different identifiers together, i.e.,
&lt;code&gt;GLUE(colour,_name)&lt;/code&gt; results in &lt;code&gt;colour_name&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLUE3(x,y,z)
&lt;/source&gt;

Special C source macro to stick three different identifiers together, i.e.,
&lt;code&gt;GLUE(a,b,c)&lt;/code&gt; results in &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;.

=Programming Utilities=
A set of functions which are useful for general purpose, portable programming is
provided.  These include such basic areas as strings, time, file IO, etc.  Many parts of
the BIC Volume IO Library  refer to the programming utilities, and it is advisable that
users of the BIC Volume IO Library  try to use these functions whenever convenient. The
following is a list of all the programming utilities, grouped into related areas, and
ordered alphabetically.

==Strings==
Some simple string manipulation techniques are provided.  Strings are arbitrarily
long &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;-terminated character arrays, which are allocated and
deleted as needed.  The type &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt; is defined as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  typedef  char   *STRING;
&lt;/source&gt;

The basic string creation and deletion routines are:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  alloc_string(
      int   length )
  public  STRING  create_string(
      STRING    initial )
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;alloc_string&lt;/code&gt; allocates storage for a string of the
desired length (by allocating &lt;code&gt;length+1&lt;/code&gt; bytes), without assigning
any value to the string.  The function &lt;code&gt;create_string&lt;/code&gt; creates an
allocated string with the value equal to &lt;code&gt;initial&lt;/code&gt;.  If
&lt;code&gt;initial&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer an empty string
(``'') is created.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  delete_string(
      STRING   string )
&lt;/source&gt;

The storage associated with a string may be deleted with this function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  string_length(
      STRING   string )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the length of the string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  equal_strings(
      STRING   str1,
      STRING   str2 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the two strings are exactly equal.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  replace_string(
      STRING   *string,
      STRING   new_string )
&lt;/source&gt;

A convenience function which deletes the &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; argument, and
reassigns it to the &lt;code&gt;new_string&lt;/code&gt;.  It does not copy the value of
&lt;code&gt;new_string&lt;/code&gt;, but merely sets the &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; to
the pointer &lt;code&gt;new_string&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  concat_char_to_string(
      STRING   *string,
      char     ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

Concatenates a character to the end of the string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  concat_strings(
      STRING   str1,
      STRING   str2 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates and returns a string which is the concatenation of the two arguments, without
changing the string arguments.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  concat_to_string(
      STRING   *string,
      STRING   str2 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Replaces the argument &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; with the concatenation of the
arguments &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;str2&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  is_lower_case(
      char  ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the character is a lower case letter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  is_upper_case(
      char  ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the character is a upper case letter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  char  get_lower_case(
      char   ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

If the character is upper case, returns the lower case version of the character,
otherwise, returns the character itself.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  char  get_upper_case(
      char   ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

If the character is lower case, returns the upper case version
of the character, otherwise, returns the character itself.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  string_ends_in(
      STRING   string,
      STRING   ending )
&lt;/source&gt;

Determines if the string ends in the specified &lt;code&gt;ending&lt;/code&gt;.  For
instance, passing the arguments, &lt;code&gt;&quot;rainfall&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;&quot;fall&quot;&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public    STRING   strip_outer_blanks(
      STRING  str )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a string which is the argument &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; without any leading
or trailing blanks.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  make_string_upper_case(
      STRING    string )
&lt;/source&gt;

Converts the string to an all upper case string.  Modifies the
string in place.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  find_character(
      STRING  string,
      char    ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

Searches for the given character in the given &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;,
returning the index where it was found, or -1 if it was not found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  blank_string(
      STRING   string )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns true if the string is empty or consists of only space,
tab, and newline characters.

==General File IO==
Although one may use the standard UNIX file interface (&lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt;,
for example), the BIC Volume IO Library  contains a set of routines for doing all
file operations, with the potential to be portable to other operating systems.  There
are some other minor advantages, including the automatic expansion of &lt;function&gt;~
&lt;/function&gt; and environment variables.  Also, automatic decompression of compressed
files is provided.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  expand_filename(
      STRING  filename )
&lt;/source&gt;

Searches the argument &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; for certain patterns, and expands
them appropriately, returning the resulting expanded filename. Any sequence of
characters starting with a &lt;code&gt;~ &lt;/code&gt; up to but not including a slash,
&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, will be changed to the specified user's home directory. Any
occurrence of a dollar sign, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, will result in the following
text, up to the next slash, being expanded to the environment variable specified by
the text.  This expansion can be avoided by placing a backslash, \ before any
&lt;code&gt;~ &lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;.  In all the following functions
which take filenames, automatic expansion of filenames is performed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  file_exists(
      STRING        filename )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the file exists.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  check_clobber_file(
      STRING   filename )
  public  BOOLEAN  check_clobber_file_default_suffix(
      STRING   filename,
      STRING   default_suffix )
&lt;/source&gt;

Checks to see if the file exists, and if so, prompts the user as to
whether it may be overwritten.  Returns TRUE if either the file
does not exist, or if it does and the user answers &lt;code&gt;`y'&lt;/code&gt; to the
prompt.  The second form of the file appends a default suffix to the
filename, if it does not yet have a suffix.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  remove_file(
      STRING  filename )
&lt;/source&gt;

Removes the specified file, which results in the file being
removed only after all references to it are closed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  filename_extension_matches(
      STRING   filename,
      STRING   extension )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the file ends in the given extension, preceded
by a period. e.g., &lt;function&gt;filename_extension_matches( &quot;volume.mnc&quot; , &quot;mnc&quot;
)&lt;/function&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. Correctly handles compressed files,
e.g., passing the arguments, &lt;code&gt;&quot;volume.mnc.Z&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;&quot;mnc&quot;&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  remove_directories_from_filename(
      STRING  filename )
&lt;/source&gt;

Strips the directories from the filename, returning the result.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  extract_directory(
      STRING    filename )
&lt;/source&gt;

Extracts the directory from the filename, returning the result.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  get_absolute_filename(
      STRING    filename,
      STRING    directory )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a filename and a current directory, returns an absolute filename (one starting
with a slash, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  open_file(
      STRING             filename,
      IO_types           io_type,
      File_formats       file_format,
      FILE               **file )
  public  Status  open_file_with_default_suffix(
      STRING             filename,
      STRING             default_suffix,
      IO_types           io_type,
      File_formats       file_format,
      FILE               **file )
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;open_file()&lt;/code&gt; opens the specified file, where
&lt;code&gt;io_type&lt;/code&gt; must be one of &lt;code&gt;WRITE_FILE&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;READ_FILE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;file_format&lt;/code&gt; must be one of
&lt;code&gt;ASCII_FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BINARY_FORMAT&lt;/code&gt;.  If
successful, the file pointer is passed back in the last argument and a status of
&lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; is returned. Otherwise, a null pointer is passed back, and a
status of &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt; is returned.  Filename expansion is
automatically performed.  The second function performs the same task as
&lt;code&gt;open_file&lt;/code&gt; with the addition that it automatically adds the
specified suffix extension, if needed.  On input, if the specified file does not
exist and the file does not have an extension, then it looks for the specified file
with the default extension.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  close_file(
      FILE     *file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Closes the file, returning &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; if successful.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  set_file_position(
      FILE     *file,
      long     byte_position )
&lt;/source&gt;

Seeks to the specified position in the file, where 0 corresponds to the beginning of
the file, returning &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; if successful.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  flush_file(
      FILE     *file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Flushes the file buffer of any pending output, returning &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; if
successful.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_character(
      FILE  *file,
      char   *ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs a character from the file and passes it back as the second argument.  If the
character is the end of file character, returns a status of
&lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise, &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  unget_character(
      FILE  *file,
      char  ch )
&lt;/source&gt;

blank, a tab, or a newline character.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status   skip_input_until(
      FILE   *file,
      char   search_char )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs characters from the file until the specified search character is found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_string(
      FILE    *file,
      STRING  *str,
      char    termination_char )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs a string from the file.  The file is read into the string until either the
termination character or a newline character is found.  If the string ends at a
newline character and the termination character is not a newline, the next character
available from the file will be the newline character.  Otherwise, the next
character available is the one just after the termination character found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_quoted_string(
      FILE            *file,
      STRING          *str )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs a string from a file, delimited by quotation marks, returning
&lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt;.  After successful reading of
a string, the next character available from the file is the one just after the
ending quotation mark.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_possibly_quoted_string(
      FILE            *file,
      STRING          *str )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs a string from a file, delimited by quotation marks or white space, returning
&lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt;.  After successful reading of
a string, the next character available from the file is the one just after the
ending quotation mark or last non-white space character.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_line(
      FILE    *file,
      STRING  line )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs characters from the file into the argument &lt;code&gt;line&lt;/code&gt;, up
until the next newline character.  If a newline was found, the next available
character will be the one after the newline.  The newline character is not stored in
the string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_boolean(
      FILE            *file,
      BOOLEAN         *b )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs the next non-white character. If it is a ``&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;'' or
``&lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;'', then the value &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; is passed
back. If it is a ``&lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;'' or ``&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;'', then the
value &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; is passed back.  Otherwise
&lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt; is returned.

  public  Status  input_newline(
      FILE            *file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs and discards characters from the file up to and including the next newline
character.  Returns &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; if a newline was found, or

If the argument is &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, then a space and the letter
``&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;'' is output, otherwise, a space and the letter
``&lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;'' is output.

==Memory Allocation==
A set of macros is provided to allow easy allocation and deallocation
of memory, with up to 5 dimensional arrays.  Memory allocation
checking is also performed, to catch errors such as freeing memory
that was not allocated.  Also, the memory allocation automatically
tracks all memory allocated, so that detection of memory leaks
(orphaned memory) is possible.

===Basic Memory Allocation===
The basic macros are as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ALLOC( ptr, n_items )
&lt;/source&gt;

Allocates &lt;code&gt;n_items&lt;/code&gt; elements of the correct type,
assigning the result to the argument &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  FREE( ptr )
&lt;/source&gt;

Frees the memory pointed to by the argument &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  REALLOC( ptr, n_items )
&lt;/source&gt;

Changes the size of the memory pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; to be of
size &lt;code&gt;n_items&lt;/code&gt; elements, possibly changing the value of
&lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; in the process.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ALLOC_VAR_SIZED_STRUCT( ptr, element_type, n_elements )
&lt;/source&gt;

Allocates a variable sized structure, which must be of a specific form.  The last
element of the structure must be an array of size 1, and this array will
constitute the variable-sized part of the structure.  The argument
&lt;code&gt;element_type&lt;/code&gt; must be the type of this last element, and the
argument &lt;code&gt;n_elements&lt;/code&gt; is the desired number of elements to
allocate for this array, in addition to the memory for the first part of the
structure.  An example of usage is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  {
              struct {  int   a;
                        float b;
                        char  data[1];
                     }                    *ptr;
  
              ALLOC_VAR_SIZED_STRUCT( ptr, char, 10 );
  
              ptr-&gt;a = 1;
              ptr-&gt;b = 2.5;
              ptr-&gt;data[0] = 'a';
              ptr-&gt;data[9] = 'i';
          }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ALLOC2D( ptr, n1, n2 )
      ALLOC3D( ptr, n1, n2, n3 )
      ALLOC4D( ptr, n1, n2, n3, n4 )
      ALLOC5D( ptr, n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Allocates a 2 to 5 dimensional array of size &lt;code&gt;n1&lt;/code&gt; by
&lt;code&gt;n2&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  and stores the result in the specified pointer,
&lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;.  In the 2 dimensional case, this is accomplished with
only 2 memory allocations, one to allocate &lt;code&gt;n1&lt;/code&gt; times
&lt;code&gt;n2&lt;/code&gt; elements for the storage, and the second to allocate
&lt;code&gt;n1&lt;/code&gt; pointers into the first memory area.  In general, there is
one memory allocation for each dimension required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  FREE2D( ptr )
      FREE3D( ptr )
      FREE4D( ptr )
      FREE5D( ptr )
&lt;/source&gt;

Frees the memory associated with the multi-dimensional array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_alloc_checking(
      BOOLEAN state )
&lt;/source&gt;

Enables or disables allocation checking.  It is usually called at the beginning
of a program to provide double-checking of allocation.  It incurs an extra
allocation every time one of the previous allocation macros is invoked.  If this
function is not called, allocation checking can be turned on by setting the
environment variable &lt;code&gt;DEBUG_ALLOC&lt;/code&gt; to anything.

Allocation checking detects three types of memory programming errors: freeing a
pointer that was not allocated, by checking that memory chunks returned from the
system malloc routine do not overlap existing ones, sometimes detects when the
system memory has become corrupted, and by recording all memory allocated and
printing out what is currently allocated, can detect memory leaks.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  output_alloc_to_file(
      STRING   filename )
&lt;/source&gt;

If memory checking was enabled, this function can be used to detect memory
leaks.  At the end of a program, the programmer should free up all memory that is
known, then call this function.  Any remaining allocated memory is printed out to
a file, indicating the file and line number where the memory was allocated.

===Higher Level Array Allocation===
In addition to the basic memory allocation macros described previously, a set of
useful macros for dealing with arrays of dynamically changing size are provided:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  SET_ARRAY_SIZE( array, previous_n_elems, new_n_elems,
                      chunk_size )
&lt;/source&gt;

This macro increases or decreases the size of an array, by specifying the number
of elements previously allocated to the array (starts out at zero). The
&lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt; argument defines the size of the memory chunks
which are allocated.  For instance, if &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt; is 100,
then this macro will only reallocate the array if the size change crosses to a
different multiple of 100, thus avoiding memory allocation every time it is
called.  This specification of the granularity of the memory allocation must be
consistently specified; if this macro is called with a given variable and chunk
size, then subsequent calls to this macro with the same variable must specify the
same chunk size.  Note also that the number passed in as
&lt;code&gt;new_n_elems&lt;/code&gt; must be passed in as
&lt;code&gt;previous_n_elems&lt;/code&gt; on the next call to this macro.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ADD_ELEMENT_TO_ARRAY( array, n_elems,
                            elem_to_add, chunk_size )
&lt;/source&gt;

Adds the argument &lt;code&gt;elem_to_add&lt;/code&gt; to the array at the
&lt;code&gt;n_elems&lt;/code&gt;'th index, then increments
&lt;code&gt;n_elems&lt;/code&gt;. The argument &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt;
specifies the granularity of memory allocation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  DELETE_ELEMENT_FROM_ARRAY( array, n_elems, index_to_remove,
                                 chunk_size )
&lt;/source&gt;

Deletes the &lt;code&gt;index_to_remove&lt;/code&gt;'th element from the array,
decreasing the number of elements in the array (&lt;code&gt;n_elems&lt;/code&gt;) and
decreasing the memory allocation, if crossing a multiple of
&lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt;.  Again, &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt; must be
specified the same for all invocations of the previous three macros involving a
given pointer.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  ADD_ELEMENT_TO_ARRAY_WITH_SIZE( array, n_alloced, n_elems,
                                      elem_to_add, chunk_size )
&lt;/source&gt;

Adds an element (&lt;code&gt;elem_to_add&lt;/code&gt;) to the array, incrementing
&lt;code&gt;n_elems&lt;/code&gt;.  If necessary, the memory is increased by the amount
specified in &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt; and the
&lt;code&gt;n_alloced&lt;/code&gt; variable is incremented by this amount.  The usage
of this differs from the use of &lt;code&gt;ADD_ELEMENT_TO_ARRAY&lt;/code&gt; in that
the number of elements (&lt;code&gt;n_elems&lt;/code&gt;) can be decreased
arbitrarily, without causing memory to be deallocated.

==Progress Reports==
In order to provide simple monitoring of the progress of a particular processing
task, a progress reporting module is available.  While a task is in progress, the
progress report prints dots across the line indicating how close to finished the task
is.  If the task is going to take very long, (greater than 2 minutes), the progress
report periodically prints the current percentage done and the estimated time
remaining.  An example of usage, followed by function descriptions, is presented:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  {
      int                 i, n_slices;
      progress_struct     progress;
  
      n_slices = 100;
  
      initialize_progress_report( &amp;progress, FALSE,
                  n_slices, &quot;Processing Slices&quot; );
  
      for( i = 0;  i &lt; n_slices;  ++i )
      {
          process_slice( i );
  
          update_progress_report( &amp;progress, i + 1 );
      }
  
      terminate_progress_report( &amp;progress );
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  initialize_progress_report(
      progress_struct   *progress,
      BOOLEAN           one_line_only,
      int               n_steps,
      STRING            title )
&lt;/source&gt;

Initializes a progress report struct, specifying the number of steps that will occur
in  the processing, and the title to print out for the progress report.  During
progress report, the display will automatically switch from the short-job mode of
printing a single row of dots across a line to the long-job mode of periodically
printing the percentage done and estimated time remaining.  If the
&lt;code&gt;one_line_only&lt;/code&gt; flag is &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, this is
disabled and only a single row of dots will be displayed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  update_progress_report(
      progress_struct   *progress,
      int               current_step )
&lt;/source&gt;

Tells the progress reporting module how many steps have been done, and causes update
of the display of dots on the line or estimated time remaining.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  terminate_progress_report(
      progress_struct   *progress )
&lt;/source&gt;

Terminates the progress report.

==Text Output==
Rather than using the standard UNIX function &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; for routine
text output, a module which is similar in appearance is provided, which allows for
installing arbitrary printing output functions.  This can be used, for instance, to
mirror output to a log file for instance, or to send text to an X window.  The
primary change is to use a function called &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;print_error&lt;/code&gt; with exactly the same arguments as for the standard
&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  print( STRING format, ... )
  public  void  print_error( STRING format, ... )
&lt;/source&gt;

Takes the same arguments as &lt;code&gt;printf()&lt;/code&gt;, but allows
installing of a user output function for the final stage of output.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_print_function(
      void     (*function) ( STRING ) )
  public  void  set_print_error_function(
      void     (*function) ( STRING )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the output function, where all text from calls to &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;
or &lt;code&gt;print_error&lt;/code&gt; will be sent.  By default, there is no print
function, and output is sent to printf().

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  push_print_function()
  public  void  push_print_error_function()
&lt;/source&gt;

Temporarily sets the print or error printing function to go to
standard out, and allows the user to set another print function, which
will disappear when the corresponding &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; function is called.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  pop_print_function()
  public  void  pop_print_error_function()
&lt;/source&gt;

Restores the previous user print or error printing function.

==Time==
Some basic utilities relating to time, date, and CPU time are provided.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Real  current_cpu_seconds( void )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the number of CPU seconds used by the current process so far.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Real  current_realtime_seconds( void )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the number of seconds that the current process has been running.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  get_clock_time()
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a string representing the current clock time (hours and minutes),
for which the caller is reponsible for deleting.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  get_date()
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a string representing the current date, for which the caller is reponsible
for deleting.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  format_time(
      STRING   format,
      Real     seconds )
&lt;/source&gt;

Takes a time in seconds and a format string which has format components, e.g. ``%g
%s'', and prints the time into a string in appropriate units of milliseconds,
seconds, minutes, days, etc.   The string is returned and the calling program is
responsible for deleting the string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  print_time(
      STRING   format,
      Real     seconds )
&lt;/source&gt;

Same as &lt;code&gt;format_time&lt;/code&gt;, but calls &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; with
the result.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  sleep_program(
      Real seconds )
&lt;/source&gt;

Suspends the program for the specified number of seconds.  Note that on most systems,
this will only be performed to the nearest multiple of some particular time
increment.  On Silicon Graphics Systems this will be to the nearest hundredth of a
second.

=Volumes=
Processing tasks within the lab where this software was developed deal with
multi-dimensional volumes of data such as created by Magnetic Resonance and PET
scanners.  Therefore, an extensive set of routines is provided to represent volumes,
and to read and write volumes in the MINC format.

The basic type of a volume is &lt;code&gt;Volume&lt;/code&gt;, which is actually a pointer
to an allocated structure which contains all the information about the type of volume,
number of dimensions, voxel values, etc.  In order to use a volume structure, the
volume must first be created, then the size of the volume set, then the large array of
voxel values is allocated.  Alternately, a volume may be automatically created by
calling the appropriate function to read a MINC file and create a volume.

A volume has an associated number of dimensions, which must be in the range from one to
five, but typically is three.  The volume is thought of as a multi-dimensional array of
any of a variety of types, including all sizes of integer and real types.  Even though
a volume may be stored in say, a 1 byte type, with values from zero to 255, there is a
real value range which provides mapping a mapping from voxel values  to any arbitrary
real range.  In this way, the real range may be any valid real interval and is
independent of the particular storage type.

Since most volumes will be created by reading from a MINC file, this method will be
presented first, followed by a description of how to create a volume from scratch. 
Finally a lower level of MINC input and output for more advanced applications will be
presented.

==Volume Input==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_volume(
      STRING               filename,
      int                  n_dimensions,
      STRING               dim_names[],
      nc_type              volume_nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN              volume_signed_flag,
      Real                 volume_voxel_min,
      Real                 volume_voxel_max,
      BOOLEAN              create_volume_flag,
      Volume               *volume,
      minc_input_options   *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

This routine reads a volume from a MINC file, first creating the volume if the
&lt;code&gt;create_volume_flag&lt;/code&gt; is specified as &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;
(the usual case).  The number of dimensions is the desired number of dimensions for
the volume.  If this is less than the number of dimensions in the file, then only
the first part of the file, corresponding to this number of dimensions, is read.  If
the number of dimensions specified is less than 1, then the number of dimensions in
the file is used. The argument &lt;code&gt;dim_names&lt;/code&gt; specifies in what
order the volume is to be stored in the volume variable.  For each dimension in the
stored volume, there is a corresponding name, which is one of
&lt;code&gt;MIxspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MIyspace&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;MIzspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ANY_SPATIAL_DIMENSION&lt;/code&gt;, or an
empty string.  These are matched up with corresponding dimensions in the file and
the dimension ordering of the volume array is reordered on input.  So, if the user
wishes to represent the volume in X-Z-Y order, then the value passed as the
&lt;code&gt;dim_names&lt;/code&gt; array should be the three strings,
&lt;code&gt;MIxspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MIzspace&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;MIyspace&lt;/code&gt;.  This choice of ordering is important, as it defines
the order of any subsequent reference to voxel indices.

The four arguments, &lt;code&gt;volume_nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt; through
&lt;code&gt;volume_voxel_max&lt;/code&gt; can be used to specified the desired storage
type within the volume variable, automatically converted from the storage type in
the file.  The &lt;code&gt;volume_nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt; is one of
&lt;code&gt;MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NC_BYTE&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;NC_SHORT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NC_LONG&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;NC_FLOAT&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;NC_DOUBLE&lt;/code&gt;.  For the integer
types, the &lt;code&gt;volume_signed_flag&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if a
signed type is desired, otherwise, it is &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.  The
&lt;code&gt;volume_voxel_min&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;volume_voxel_max&lt;/code&gt;
specify the range of valid voxel values, and are usually set equal to indicate to
use the full range of the type, e.g. zero to 255.0 for unsigned
&lt;code&gt;NC_BYTE&lt;/code&gt;.  If &lt;code&gt;MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE&lt;/code&gt; is passed,
then the type, sign, and voxel range in the file are used.

If the &lt;code&gt;create_volume_flag&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, the
usual case, then the volume is automatically created.  Otherwise, it is assumed that
the volume already exists and will only be recreated if its current size is
different from the new size resulting from the file, thus reducing the amount of
memory allocation when reading multiple files.

The &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; argument specifies some special options to the
input process, and is usually passed just a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer,
indicating that the default options should be used.  Currently the possible options
are:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_default_minc_input_options(
      minc_input_options  *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

Fills in the default options into an &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; structure
which will subsequently be passed to &lt;code&gt;input_volume()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_minc_input_promote_invalid_to_min_flag(
      minc_input_options  *options,
      BOOLEAN             flag )
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, any voxel value which is outside the valid range of voxel values is
promoted to the minimum valid voxel value.  If this &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; is set
to &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;, this promotion is disabled.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_minc_input_vector_to_scalar_flag(
      minc_input_options  *options,
      BOOLEAN             flag )
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, any volume which contains a dimension which is of
type vector, for instance, an RGB colour volume, is converted to a
scalar volume by averaging the components of each vector.  This can be
disabled by passing the &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_minc_input_vector_to_colour_flag(
      minc_input_options  *options,
      BOOLEAN             flag )
  public  void  set_minc_input_colour_dimension_size(
      minc_input_options  *options,
      int                 size )
  public  void  set_minc_input_colour_indices(
      minc_input_options  *options,
      int                 indices[4] )
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, any volume which contains a dimension which is of
type vector, for instance, an RGB colour volume, is converted to a
scalar volume by averaging the components of each vector.  If this
option is set to true, any vector volume with the number of components
specified by &lt;code&gt;set_minc_input_colour_dimension_size&lt;/code&gt;
(default 3) is converted to a colour volume, using the
indices specified by &lt;code&gt;set_minc_input_colour_indices&lt;/code&gt;
(default 0, 1, 2).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_minc_input_user_real_range(
      minc_input_options  *options,
      double              minimum,
      double              maximum )
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, files read into an integer-type volume will be
scaled so that the real range is the full range of the data in the
input file. The user can define another range by calling this function
with an appropriate real minimum and maximum. For float-type Volumes,
setting the range will change the real range of the volume, but
not change the actual values in the volume. If minimum is greater than
or equal to maximum, then the default behaviour is restored.

==Alternative Volume Input Methods==
Rather than using the &lt;code&gt;input_volume()&lt;/code&gt; function to input a volume
in one shot, there is another method which will allow interspersing volume input
with other processing tasks.  The following is the set of routines which the
&lt;code&gt;input_volume()&lt;/code&gt; function calls in order to input a volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  start_volume_input(
      STRING               filename,
      int                  n_dimensions,
      STRING               dim_names[],
      nc_type              volume_nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN              volume_signed_flag,
      Real                 volume_voxel_min,
      Real                 volume_voxel_max,
      BOOLEAN              create_volume_flag,
      Volume               *volume,
      minc_input_options   *options,
      volume_input_struct  *input_info )
&lt;/source&gt;

This initializes a filename for inputting the volume incrementally.   The arguments
to this are identical to those for the &lt;code&gt;input_volume()&lt;/code&gt; function,
with the addition of the &lt;code&gt;input_info&lt;/code&gt; structure which is
initialized for use in the remaining functions. The volume is created if necessary,
but not allocated, and no part of the volume is read in. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  delete_volume_input(
      volume_input_struct   *input_info )
&lt;/source&gt;

Closes the file and terminates the input of the volume.  By calling the
&lt;code&gt;start_volume_input()&lt;/code&gt; function followed by the
&lt;code&gt;delete_volume_input()&lt;/code&gt; function, a volume can be created that
has all the information about the file volume, without the voxels being allocated.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  cancel_volume_input(
      Volume                volume,
      volume_input_struct   *input_info )
&lt;/source&gt;

Closes the file, terminates the input of the volume, and deletes the volume.  Simply
calls &lt;code&gt;delete_volume_input()&lt;/code&gt; followed by
&lt;code&gt;delete_volume()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  input_more_of_volume(
      Volume                volume,
      volume_input_struct   *input_info,
      Real                  *fraction_done )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs a small chunk of the volume, calculated to be efficient, yet not be so large
that one cannot usably intersperse calls to do other processing with calls to this
function.  Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if there is more to do, i.e., this
function should be called again.  The fraction done is passed back as a number
between 0 and 1.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Minc_file   get_volume_input_minc_file(
      volume_input_struct   *volume_input )
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Minc_file&lt;/code&gt; structure from the volume input is passed back,
to allow use of this in routines that require this type.

==Volume Output==
Volume output is accomplished by one of two routines, depending on whether or not
the volume is treated as a modified version of another volume or is an independent
volume on its own.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  output_volume(
      STRING                filename,
      nc_type               file_nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN               file_signed_flag,
      Real                  file_voxel_min,
      Real                  file_voxel_max,
      Volume                volume,
      STRING                history,
      minc_output_options   *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs the specified volume to the specified filename.  If the argument
&lt;code&gt;file_nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE&lt;/code&gt; then
the volume is stored in the MINC file in the same type as in the volume variable. 
Otherwise, the four arguments, &lt;code&gt;file_nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;file_signed_flag&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;file_voxel_min&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;file_voxel_max&lt;/code&gt;, specify the type and valid voxel range to store
the volume in the file.  If the &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; argument is non-null,
then it represents a description of the volume, and will be placed in the MINC
volume.  If the &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; argument is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;,
then the default options will be used.  Otherwise, some specific output options can
be set through this parameter, and the following functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_default_minc_output_options(
      minc_output_options  *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; structure to the default values.  The user can
then override the default values and pass the structure to the
&lt;code&gt;output_volume()&lt;/code&gt; function.  Currently, there is only one output
option:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  delete_minc_output_options(
      minc_output_options  *options           )
&lt;/source&gt;

Deletes the &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; data.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_minc_output_dimensions_order(
      minc_output_options  *options,
      int                  n_dimensions,
      STRING               dimension_names[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Defines the output order of the file.  Each dimension name string must have a
matching dimension name in the volume, which defines the order of the dimensions in
the output file.  For instance, one may have input the volume in &lt;function&gt;(x, y,
z)&lt;/function&gt; order. To get it output in &lt;code&gt;(z, y, x)&lt;/code&gt; order, set
&lt;code&gt;dimension_names&lt;/code&gt; to the three strings
&lt;code&gt;MIzspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MIyspace&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;MIxspace&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_minc_output_real_range(
      minc_output_options  *options,
      Real                 real_min,
      Real                 real_max )
&lt;/source&gt;

Defines the image range that will appear in the file.  By default, none is
specified, and &lt;code&gt;output_volume&lt;/code&gt; uses the real minimum and maximum
of the volume.  To set the real range of the volume, see the relevant documentation
for &lt;code&gt;set_volume_real_range()&lt;/code&gt;.

If the volume is a modification of another volume currently stored in a file, then
it is more appropriate to use the following function to
output the volume:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  output_modified_volume(
      STRING                filename,
      nc_type               file_nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN               file_signed_flag,
      Real                  file_voxel_min,
      Real                  file_voxel_max,
      Volume                volume,
      STRING                original_filename,
      STRING                history,
      minc_output_options   *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

The only difference between this function and the other method of volume output
(&lt;code&gt;output_volume()&lt;/code&gt;), is that this function copies auxiliary data
from the original file (&lt;code&gt;original_filename&lt;/code&gt;) to the new file. 
This auxiliary data includes such items as patient name and other scanning data, and
is not read into a volume, so the only way to correctly pass it along to a new MINC
file is to use this function.

==Volume Manipulation==
Once a volume has been created and allocated, there are many functions for
manipulating the volume.  Note that associated with each volume is a valid voxel
range indicating the range of values actually stored in the volume, for instance,
zero to 200 is one possible range for an unsigned byte volume.  There is a second
range, the &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt; range, which is the mapping of the valid voxel
range to an arbitrary real range, for instance, the zero to 200 of valid voxels
could map to -1.5 to 1.5 in the &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt; range.  When dealing with
volumes, one is generally interested in the &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt; range.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Real  get_volume_voxel_value(
      Volume   volume,
      int      v0,
      int      v1,
      int      v2,
      int      v3,
      int      v4 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume and from one to five voxel indices, depending on the volume
dimensions, returns the corresponding voxel value. For instance, if the volume is
three dimensional, then the final two arguments are ignored.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  value = convert_voxel_to_value( volume, voxel );
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume and a voxel value, converts this to a value in the real range, and
returns it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  voxel = convert_value_to_voxel( volume, value )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume and a real value, converts this to a voxel value in the valid voxel
range, and returns it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Real  get_volume_real_value(
      Volume   volume,
      int      v0,
      int      v1,
      int      v2,
      int      v3,
      int      v4 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume and from one to five voxel indices, depending on the volume
dimensions, returns the corresponding real value. For instance, if the volume is
three dimensional, then the final two arguments are ignored.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_voxel_value(
      Volume   volume,
      int      v0,
      int      v1,
      int      v2,
      int      v3,
      int      v4,
      Real     voxel )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume, one to five voxel indices, and a &lt;code&gt;voxel&lt;/code&gt; value,
assigns this value to the corresponding voxel in the volume. Note that no conversion
from the valid real range to the valid voxel range is performed, so the user may
need to use the &lt;code&gt;convert_value_to_voxel&lt;/code&gt; function first or use
the &lt;code&gt;set_volume_real_value&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_real_value(
      Volume   volume,
      int      v0,
      int      v1,
      int      v2,
      int      v3,
      int      v4,
      Real     value )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume, one to five voxel indices, and a &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, assigns
this value to the corresponding voxel in the volume, after converting to a voxel
value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  delete_volume(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Deletes all the memory associated with an volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  nc_type  get_volume_nc_data_type(
      Volume       volume,
      BOOLEAN      *signed_flag )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the storage type of the volume (for instance,
&lt;code&gt;NC_SHORT&lt;/code&gt;), and passes back an indication of whether it is
signed or unsigned.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  get_volume_n_dimensions(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the number of dimensions of the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  get_volume_sizes(
      Volume   volume,
      int      sizes[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Stores the size of each dimension in the array &lt;code&gt;sizes&lt;/code&gt;. This is
the number of voxels in each dimension.  The array &lt;code&gt;sizes&lt;/code&gt; must
be at least as large as the number of dimensions of the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  get_volume_separations(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     separations[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Stores the slice separation for each dimension in the array
&lt;code&gt;separations&lt;/code&gt;.  The array &lt;code&gt;separations&lt;/code&gt; must
be at least as large as the number of dimensions of the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Real  get_volume_voxel_min(
      Volume   volume )
  public  Real  get_volume_voxel_max(
      Volume   volume )
  public  void  get_volume_voxel_range(
      Volume     volume,
      Real       *voxel_min,
      Real       *voxel_max )
&lt;/source&gt;

The first two functions return the minimum or maximum allowable voxel value.  The
third function passes back both values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Real  get_volume_real_min(
      Volume     volume )
  public  Real  get_volume_real_max(
      Volume     volume )
  public  void  get_volume_real_range(
      Volume     volume,
      Real       *min_value,
      Real       *max_value )
&lt;/source&gt;

The first two functions return the minimum or maximum real value.  The third
function passes back both values.  The mapping to this real space linearly maps the
minimum &lt;code&gt;voxel&lt;/code&gt; value to the minimum &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;
value and the maximum &lt;code&gt;voxel&lt;/code&gt; value to the maximum
&lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt; value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  *get_volume_dimension_names(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a pointer to the list of names of each dimension.  This memory must be freed
by the calling function using the following function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  delete_dimension_names(
      Volume   volume,
      STRING   dimension_names[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Frees the memory allocated for the dimension names.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_rgb_volume_flag(
      Volume   volume,
      BOOLEAN  flag )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the volume flag indicating whether the volume is of type red-green-blue
colour.  Only volumes whose data type is unsigned long may be rgb volumes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  is_an_rgb_volume(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if the volume is a red-green-blue colour volume,
as can be created on volume input.

===Volume Coordinate Systems===
A volume has two coordinate systems.  The ''voxel'' coordinate
system is simply the n-dimensional indexing coordinate system for a volume.  A
voxel coordinate of (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), for instance, corresponds to the centre of
the first voxel in a three dimensional volume.  A voxel coordinate of ( 99.0,
0.0, 0.0 ) corresponds to the centre of the last voxel in the first direction of
a three dimensional volume of size ( 100, 200, 150 ).  The second coordinate
system is an arbitrary three dimensional coordinate system, usually referred to
as the ''world'' coordinate system, often the Talairach
coordinate system.  The following functions provide conversion to and from these
two coordinate systems:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  convert_voxel_to_world(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     voxel[],
      Real     *x_world,
      Real     *y_world,
      Real     *z_world )
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a volume and a real valued voxel index, passes back the corresponding world
coordinate.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  convert_3D_voxel_to_world(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     voxel1,
      Real     voxel2,
      Real     voxel3,
      Real     *x_world,
      Real     *y_world,
      Real     *z_world )
&lt;/source&gt;

Same as &lt;code&gt;convert_voxel_to_world&lt;/code&gt; except it applies only to
three dimensional volumes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  convert_world_to_voxel(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     x_world,
      Real     y_world,
      Real     z_world,
      Real     voxel[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Converts a world coordinate into a voxel.  In order to use these voxel
coordinates as integer indices, for instance, as arguments to the
&lt;code&gt;GET_VALUE&lt;/code&gt; macros, each component of the argument
&lt;code&gt;voxel&lt;/code&gt; must first be rounded to the nearest integer.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  convert_3D_world_to_voxel(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     x_world,
      Real     y_world,
      Real     z_world,
      Real     *voxel1,
      Real     *voxel2,
      Real     *voxel3 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Same as &lt;code&gt;convert_world_to_voxel&lt;/code&gt; except it applies only to
three dimensional volumes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  convert_voxel_vector_to_world(
      Volume          volume,
      Real            voxel_vector[],
      Real            *x_world,
      Real            *y_world,
      Real            *z_world )
  public  void  convert_world_vector_to_voxel(
      Volume          volume,
      Real            x_world,
      Real            y_world,
      Real            z_world,
      Real            voxel_vector[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions convert vectors between the voxel and world spaces.  This is
done by transforming the point (0,0,0) to the other space, in addition to
treating the vector as a point and transforming it to the other space, and
passing back the vector between the two results.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  convert_voxel_normal_vector_to_world(
      Volume          volume,
      Real            voxel1,
      Real            voxel2,
      Real            voxel3,
      Real            *x_world,
      Real            *y_world,
      Real            *z_world )
&lt;/source&gt;

Converts a vector which is assumed to be a surface normal to the world coordinate
system.

===Volume Interpolation===
In addition to the routines for accessing particular voxel values, the
volume can be interpolated using nearest neighbour, linear, or cubic
interpolation, specified in either voxel or world space.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int   evaluate_volume(
      Volume         volume,
      Real           voxel[],
      BOOLEAN        interpolating_dimensions[],
      int            degrees_continuity,
      BOOLEAN        use_linear_at_edge,
      Real           outside_value,
      Real           values[],
      Real           **first_deriv,
      Real           ***second_deriv )
&lt;/source&gt;

Interpolates a volume at the specified voxel, where
&lt;code&gt;degrees_continuity&lt;/code&gt; has values -1, 0, or 2, for nearest
neighbour, linear, or cubic interpolation.  If
&lt;code&gt;use_linear_at_edge&lt;/code&gt; is true, then any cubic interpolation
will be downgraded to linear interpolation near the edge of the volume.  This
option is only needed in special cases.  The parameter
&lt;code&gt;outside_value&lt;/code&gt; is the value for any point outside the volume.
The argument &lt;code&gt;interpolating_dimensions&lt;/code&gt; indicates which
dimensions are being interpolated, typically a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer
indicating that all dimensions are being interpolated. The interpolated values
are placed in the values array.  The number of values is equal to the number of
values in the non-interpolated dimensions, which is one, if all dimensions are
being interpolated.  If the derivative arguments are non-null, then the resulting
derivatives are placed in the appropriate places. The
&lt;code&gt;first_deriv&lt;/code&gt; is a two dimensional array of size number of
values by number of interpolating dimensions. The
&lt;code&gt;second_deriv&lt;/code&gt; is a three dimensional array of size number of
values by number of interpolating dimensions by number of interpolating
dimensions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void   evaluate_volume_in_world(
      Volume         volume,
      Real           x,
      Real           y,
      Real           z,
      int            degrees_continuity,
      BOOLEAN        use_linear_at_edge,
      Real           outside_value,
      Real           values[],
      Real           deriv_x[],
      Real           deriv_y[],
      Real           deriv_z[],
      Real           deriv_xx[],
      Real           deriv_xy[],
      Real           deriv_xz[],
      Real           deriv_yy[],
      Real           deriv_yz[],
      Real           deriv_zz[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Interpolates a volume at the specified world position, where
&lt;code&gt;degrees_continuity&lt;/code&gt; has values -1, 0, or 2, for nearest
neighbour, linear, or cubic interpolation.  If
&lt;code&gt;use_linear_at_edge&lt;/code&gt; is true, then any cubic interpolation
will be downgraded to linear interpolation near the edge of the volume.  This
option is only needed in special cases.  The parameter
&lt;code&gt;outside_value&lt;/code&gt; is the value for any point outside the volume.
The interpolated values are placed in the values array.  The number of values is
equal to the number of values in the non-spatial dimensions, which is one if all
dimensions are spatial.  If the derivative arguments are non-null, then the
resulting derivatives are placed in the appropriate places.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_interpolation_tolerance(
      Real   tolerance )
&lt;/source&gt;

For speed considerations, if a volume is evaluated at or near a voxel centre,
then no interpolation is performed, and the voxel value is returned. The
tolerance defines how close to the voxel centre this occurs, and defaults to 0. 
Note that if derivatives are desired and the degree of continuity specified is 0
or greater, then interpolation will be performed, even when within the specified
tolerance of the voxel.

==Volume Creation from Scratch==
In some circumstances, it is desirable to create volumes in ways
other than reading from a file.  The following functions provide
methods to create a volume from scratch or to create a volume which is
similar to an existing volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public   Volume   create_volume(
      int         n_dimensions,
      STRING      dimension_names[],
      nc_type     nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN     signed_flag,
      Real        voxel_min,
      Real        voxel_max )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates and returns a volume of the given type (for instance,
&lt;code&gt;NC_BYTE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;signed_flag&lt;/code&gt; equal
&lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;), and given valid voxel range.  The
&lt;code&gt;dimension_names&lt;/code&gt; is used to describe each dimension of the
volume and is currently only used when writing the volume to a file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_voxel_range(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     voxel_min,
      Real     voxel_max )
  public  void  set_volume_real_range(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     real_min,
      Real     real_max )
&lt;/source&gt;

After creation of a volume, the valid voxel range or valid real range can
subsequently be changed by using these functions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_sizes(
      Volume       volume,
      int          sizes[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the sizes of the volume, the number of voxels in each dimension.  Note that
this must be done before calling the function &lt;code&gt;alloc_volume_data&lt;/code&gt;
to allocate the voxels.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  alloc_volume_data(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

After the volume has been created, and its size has been set, then this function
allocates the memory for the voxels.  Note that the voxel values are not
initialized, and the user must fill the volume with desired values.

Associated with each volume is a transformation from &lt;code&gt;voxel&lt;/code&gt;
space to &lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt; space.  There are several ways to define this
transformation.  The simplest is just to specify it directly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_voxel_to_world_transform(
      Volume             volume,
      General_transform  *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Assigns the given transformation to the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  General_transform  *get_voxel_to_world_transform(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a pointer to the voxel to world transform of the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_separations(
      Volume   volume,
      Real     separations[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the inter-voxel separations in each of the volume dimensions.  Note that this
will cause the voxel-to-world transformation to be updated accordingly.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_translation(
      Volume  volume,
      Real    voxel[],
      Real    world_space_voxel_maps_to[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the translation portion of the voxel-to-world transformation.  A voxel
coordinate is specified (&lt;code&gt;voxel&lt;/code&gt;), as well as a real world
position to which it is desired that this voxel map
(&lt;code&gt;world_space_voxel_maps_to&lt;/code&gt;).  The voxel-to-world transformation
is updated to provide this mapping.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_direction_cosine(
      Volume   volume,
      int      dimension,
      Real     dir[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the real world axis for a specific voxel dimension.  For instance if
&lt;code&gt;dimension&lt;/code&gt; is 1, and &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; is (0.0, 1.0,
1.0), then voxels along the second dimension of the volume will map to the real
world axis (0.0, 1.0, 1.0) normalized to unit length, then scaled by the volume
separation for the second volume dimension.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  get_volume_direction_cosine(
      Volume   volume,
      int      dimension,
      Real     dir[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Passes back the real world axis for a specific voxel dimension.  Note that
&lt;code&gt;dimension&lt;/code&gt; must be a spatial dimension in the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_space_name(
      Volume   volume,
      STRING   name )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the coordinate system type of the volume in terms of a string name.  This can
be any string, but a set of defined constants is given by MINC:
&lt;code&gt;MI_NATIVE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MI_TALAIRACH&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;MI_CALLOSAL&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  get_volume_space_name(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a copy of the coordinate system type of the volume in terms of a string
name.  The calling function must free this string when finished with it.

===Copying Volumes===
Another method of creating a volume is to simply copy the entire volume
definition from an existing volume:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Volume   copy_volume_definition(
      Volume   existing_volume,
      nc_type  nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN  signed_flag,
      Real     voxel_min,
      Real     voxel_max )
  public  Volume   copy_volume_definition_no_alloc(
      Volume   volume,
      nc_type  nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN  signed_flag,
      Real     voxel_min,
      Real     voxel_max )
&lt;/source&gt;

Both functions creates and returns a new volume which has the same definition
(sizes, voxel-to-world space transform, etc.), as an existing volume. If the
argument &lt;code&gt;nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt; is not
&lt;code&gt;MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE&lt;/code&gt;, then the storage type of the new volume
differs from the original and is specified by &lt;code&gt;nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;signed_flag&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;voxel_min&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;voxel_max&lt;/code&gt;.  In the first function, the voxel values are
allocated but not initialized.  In the second function, they are not allocated.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Volume   copy_volume(
      Volume   volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates an exact copy of a volume.

===Volume Caching===
In order to efficiently handle volumes that are too large for virtual
memory, a simple caching scheme has been implemented.  Disk files are
read and written on demand to provide the appearance of having large
volumes fully resident in memory.  All the volume routines described
previously support this feature transparently, but there are a few
routines for configuration of the volume caching.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_n_bytes_cache_threshold(
      int  threshold )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the threshold number of bytes for volume caching.  If a volume larger than
this is created, either explicitly or by input from a file, then that volume will
be internally represented by the caching scheme. If this function is not called,
the default is either 80 megabytes, or the value of the environment variable
&lt;code&gt;VOLUME_CACHE_THRESHOLD&lt;/code&gt;, if present.  A threshold of zero
will cause all volumes to be cached.  A threshold less than zero will result in
no volumes being cached.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  typedef  enum  { SLICE_ACCESS, RANDOM_VOLUME_ACCESS }
                 Cache_block_size_hints;
  public  void  set_cache_block_sizes_hint(
      Cache_block_size_hints  hint )
  public  void  set_default_cache_block_sizes(
      int   block_sizes[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

When a voxel is accessed in a cached volume, the corresponding block containing
the voxel is read from or written to the disk as necessary.  These two functions
control the default size of the blocks and therefore the tradeoff between fast
access of adjacent voxels (using large block sizes) and fast access of
arbitrarily distributed voxels (using small block sizes). The function
&lt;code&gt;set_cache_block_sizes_hint&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the default block
sizes for volumes created in the future should be computed based on the
assumption that the application will be accessing volume voxels mostly in a
slice-by-slice manner (&lt;code&gt;SLICE_ACCESS&lt;/code&gt;) or in an unpredictable
order (&lt;code&gt;RANDOM_VOLUME_ACCESS&lt;/code&gt;).  The second function,
&lt;code&gt;set_default_cache_block_sizes&lt;/code&gt;, provides an alternative where
the default block sizes are explicitly set.  A call to either function overrides
any previous call to the other function. If neither of these functions is called,
the default value is a block size of 8 voxels per dimension, or the value
specified by the environment variable
&lt;code&gt;VOLUME_CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE&lt;/code&gt;.  These functions only affect
volumes created afterwards.  In order to change the value for a given volume, the
following function may be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_cache_block_sizes(
      Volume    volume,
      int       block_sizes[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the size of the cache block for the given volume.  Because this function
causes the cache to be completely flushed, in order to change the block size, it
may incur a temporary speed penalty during subsequent voxel accesses which cause
the cache to read blocks from a file

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_default_max_bytes_in_cache(
      int  n_bytes )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the default maximum number of bytes allowed in the cache for each volume.  A
higher number may provide faster access, due to a greater chance of finding a
particular voxel within the cache, so this value should be as large as
reasonable, given the amount of virtual memory available.  If this function is
not called, the default value is 80 megabytes, or the value of the environment
variable &lt;code&gt;VOLUME_CACHE_SIZE&lt;/code&gt;, if present.  Setting a value of
0 will result in cached volumes having exactly one block in their cache. This
function only affects volumes created subsequently.  In order to change this
value for a specific volume, the following function may be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_volume_cache_size(
      Volume    volume,
      int       max_memory_bytes )
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets the maximum number of bytes allowed in the cache for a particular volume. 
Calling this function flushes the cache, in order to reallocate the data
structures to account for the new size.  As in calling the function
&lt;code&gt;set_volume_cache_block_sizes&lt;/code&gt;, there may be a temporary speed
loss in accessing pixels.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  set_cache_output_volume_parameters(
      Volume                      volume,
      STRING                      filename,
      nc_type                     file_nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN                     file_signed_flag,
      Real                        file_voxel_min,
      Real                        file_voxel_max,
      STRING                      original_filename,
      STRING                      history,
      minc_output_options         *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

When a cached volume is modified, a temporary file is created to contain the
voxel values.  When the volume is deleted this file is also deleted.  When a
cached volume is output, the temporary file is copied to the output file, which
results in two copies of the volume existing at once, which may incur
unacceptable demands on disk storage, especially for large volumes.  To avoid
this, an application can specify a filename where to place the voxel values,
which overrides the use of a temporary file.  When the volume is deleted, this
file is closed and remains on the disk, obviating the need for the application to
output the volume.  

If the application later calls &lt;code&gt;output_volume()&lt;/code&gt; to output
this volume to a file of the same name as that set by this function, the request
to output will be ignored, because the volume already exists in this file. 
Basically, the programmer should call
&lt;code&gt;set_cache_output_volume_parameters()&lt;/code&gt; with the same
parameters that will be passed to the eventual call to
&lt;code&gt;output_volume()&lt;/code&gt;.  If the volume is a cached volume, then the
output file will be created as soon as a volume voxel is set, and the later call
to &lt;code&gt;output_volume()&lt;/code&gt; will not recreate the file, but simply
flush the cache buffer to make the file fully up to date.  If the volume is not a
cached volume, the call to
&lt;code&gt;set_cache_output_volume_parameters()&lt;/code&gt; will be ignored, and
the later call to &lt;code&gt;output_volume()&lt;/code&gt; will create the file as
specified.  Note that when calling this function, it is important to delete the
volume before exitting the program, so that cached volumes will flush their
buffer and close the file,  Otherwise, the most recent changes to the volume will
not be written to the file.

&lt;/source&gt;

==Multiple Volume Input==
The &lt;code&gt;input_volume&lt;/code&gt; function described previously is intended to
be a simple single-function interface for reading volumes for most
applications.  Occasionally, however, an application may not want to
read the whole volume at once, or may need to break the input file
into several volumes, for instance, the slices of a 3D volume.  This can
be facilitated by the following functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Minc_file  initialize_minc_input(
      STRING               filename,
      Volume               volume,
      minc_input_options   *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

This functions opens a MINC file for input to the specified volume.  The number of
dimensions in the file must be greater than or equal to the number of dimensions in
the volume, and each dimension name in the volume must have a matching dimension
name in the file.  A file handle is returned, for use in the following routines.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Minc_file  initialize_minc_input_from_minc_id(
      int                  minc_id,
      Volume               volume,
      minc_input_options   *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

This performs the same task as &lt;code&gt;initialize_minc_input&lt;/code&gt;, except it
takes a previously opened MINC file as an argument, rather than a filename.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  get_minc_file_id(
      Minc_file  file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the MINC id of the file, a handle which can be used to perform MINC
functions on the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  get_n_input_volumes(
      Minc_file  file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Determines the total number of volumes in the opened MINC file. For instance, if the
file contains x, y, z data of size 100 by 200 by 300 and the file was opened with a
two dimensional x-z volume, then the number of volumes returned will be 200, the
number of y slices.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  input_more_minc_file(
      Minc_file   file,
      Real        *fraction_done )
&lt;/source&gt;

Reads part of the MINC file to the volume specified in
&lt;code&gt;initialize_minc_input&lt;/code&gt;.  This function must be called until it
returns FALSE, at which point the volume has been fully read in.  In order to read
the next volume in the file, if any, the following function must be called.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  advance_input_volume(
      Minc_file   file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Advances the input file to the next volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  BOOLEAN  reset_input_volume(
      Minc_file   file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Resets the input to the beginning of the first volume in the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  close_minc_input(
      Minc_file   file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Closes the MINC file.

==Multiple Volume Output==
Similarly to the multiple volume input, there are routines for
providing output to a file by subvolumes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Minc_file  initialize_minc_output(
      STRING                 filename,
      int                    n_dimensions,
      STRING                 dim_names[],
      int                    sizes[],
      nc_type                file_nc_data_type,
      BOOLEAN                file_signed_flag,
      Real                   file_voxel_min,
      Real                   file_voxel_max,
      General_transform      *voxel_to_world_transform,
      Volume                 volume,
      minc_output_options    *options )
&lt;/source&gt;

Opens a MINC file for creation.  The arguments specify the number of dimensions and
the names of each dimension, as well as the sizes in each dimensions.  The type of
the file is controlled by the four parameters,
&lt;code&gt;file_nc_data_type&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;file_signed_flag&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;file_voxel_min&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;file_voxel_max&lt;/code&gt;.  The
transformation to world coordinates is specified by the
&lt;code&gt;voxel_to_world_transform&lt;/code&gt; argument.  The
&lt;code&gt;volume&lt;/code&gt; is attached to file for output. The volume must have no
more dimensions than the file and the names of each dimension must match with one of
the dimensions in the file. The &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; are as specified for
the &lt;code&gt;output_volume&lt;/code&gt; function.  Note that, unlike the
&lt;code&gt;output_volume&lt;/code&gt; function, if the image minimum and maximum are
not specified, then the output file will have a separate image minimum and maximum
for each image.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  get_minc_file_id(
      Minc_file  file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the MINC id of the file, a handle which can be used to perform MINC
functions on the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  copy_auxiliary_data_from_minc_file(
      Minc_file   file,
      STRING      filename,
      STRING      history_string )
&lt;/source&gt;

Copies the auxiliary information from the MINC file specified in the
&lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; argument to the open MINC &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  output_minc_volume(
      Minc_file   file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs the attached volume to the MINC file in the current file position.  The file
position is advanced by the size of the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  output_volume_to_minc_file_position(
      Minc_file   file,
      Volume      volume,
      int         volume_count[],
      long        file_start[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

More general routine to output the specified volume to the MINC file in the
specified position.  Since this routine does not update the file position, it does
not interfere with normal volume output using the function
&lt;code&gt;output_minc_volume&lt;/code&gt;.  The volume hyperslab defined by
&lt;code&gt;volume_count&lt;/code&gt; is written to the file starting at the given file
position.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  close_minc_output(
      Minc_file   file )
&lt;/source&gt;

Closes the MINC file.

=Tag Points=
Tag points are sets of three dimensional points which are used to mark positions of
interest.  Generally these result from manually locating corresponding positions in
multiple volumes to provide a mapping among the volumes.  Tag points are stored in an
ascii format devised at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre, with a convention of
filenames ending in &lt;code&gt;.tag&lt;/code&gt;.  A tag file can contain either sets of
single tag points or two tag points, depending on whether the file corresponds to one
or two volumes.  Each tag point consists of three coordinates, x, y, and z.  Each set
of one or two tag points has additional optional information stored with it.  A tag
point set may or may not include a set of three values:  a real valued weight, an
integer structure id, and an integer patient id.  A tag point may or may not include a
label string.  Functions to read and write files of this format are described:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_tag_points(
      FILE      *file,
      int       *n_volumes,
      int       *n_tag_points,
      Real      ***tags_volume1,
      Real      ***tags_volume2,
      Real      **weights,
      int       **structure_ids,
      int       **patient_ids,
      STRING    *labels[] )
  public  Status  input_tag_file(
      STRING    filename,
      int       *n_volumes,
      int       *n_tag_points,
      Real      ***tags_volume1,
      Real      ***tags_volume2,
      Real      **weights,
      int       **structure_ids,
      int       **patient_ids,
      STRING    *labels[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions read a set of tag points from a file.  The first form assumes the
file is already open and will be closed by the calling function, while the second form
opens and closes the file specified by a filename, with a default extension of
&lt;code&gt;.tag&lt;/code&gt;.  The number of volumes (number of tags in a set, currently
either one or two) is passed back in the &lt;code&gt;n_volumes&lt;/code&gt; argument.  The
number of tag points is passed back in the &lt;code&gt;n_tag_points&lt;/code&gt; argument. 
The three dimensional coordinates of the first tag point in each set is passed back in
the argument &lt;code&gt;tags_volume1&lt;/code&gt;.  If the number of volumes is two, then
the second tag point in each set is passed back in the argument
&lt;code&gt;tags_volume2&lt;/code&gt;.  The final four arguments pass back the auxiliary
information associated with each tag point set.  If the calling program is not
interested in any one of the four data, then it can pass in a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;
pointer and the values in the file will not be passed back.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  free_tag_points(
      int       n_volumes,
      int       n_tag_points,
      Real      **tags_volume1,
      Real      **tags_volume2,
      Real      weights[],
      int       structure_ids[],
      int       patient_ids[],
      STRING    labels[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

When finished with a list of tag points, the associated memory may be freed by calling
this function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  initialize_tag_file_input(
      FILE      *file,
      int       *n_volumes )
  public  BOOLEAN  input_one_tag(
      FILE      *file,
      int       n_volumes,
      Real      tag_volume1[],
      Real      tag_volume2[],
      Real      *weight,
      int       *structure_id,
      int       *patient_id,
      STRING    *label,
      Status    *status )
&lt;/source&gt;

These two routines provide a more memory efficient method to input tag points.  After
opening a file, the first routine is called to initialize the input of tags.  The next
routine is repeatedly called until it returns FALSE, reading one tag at a time.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  output_tag_points(
      FILE      *file,
      STRING    comments,
      int       n_volumes,
      int       n_tag_points,
      Real      **tags_volume1,
      Real      **tags_volume2,
      Real      weights[],
      int       structure_ids[],
      int       patient_ids[],
      STRING    labels[] )
  public  Status  output_tag_file(
      STRING    filename,
      STRING    comments,
      int       n_volumes,
      int       n_tag_points,
      Real      **tags_volume1,
      Real      **tags_volume2,
      Real      weights[],
      int       structure_ids[],
      int       patient_ids[],
      STRING    labels[] )
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions write a list of tag points to a tag point file.  The first form
assumes that the file has already been opened and will be closed later by the calling
function, while the second form opens and closes the file, with the default extension
of &lt;code&gt;.tag&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt; argument is any
arbitrary string documenting the contents of this file.  The number of volumes
(&lt;code&gt;n_volumes&lt;/code&gt;) must be either one or two.  The number of tag points
is specified by the argument &lt;code&gt;n_tag_points&lt;/code&gt;.  The positions of the
sets of one or two tag points are in the arguments &lt;code&gt;tags_volume1&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;tags_volume2&lt;/code&gt;.  If any of the three arguments,
&lt;code&gt;weights&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;structure_ids&lt;/code&gt;, or
&lt;code&gt;patient_ids&lt;/code&gt;, are specified as &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, then none
of these three pieces or information is written to the file.  Similarly, if the
&lt;code&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt; argument is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, then no labels are
written to the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  get_default_tag_file_suffix()
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a pointer to a string consisting of the default suffix for tag point files,
currently &lt;code&gt;``tag''&lt;/code&gt;.  This pointer should not be freed or its
contents modified.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  initialize_tag_file_output(
      FILE      *file,
      STRING    comments,
      int       n_volumes )
  public  Status  output_one_tag(
      FILE      *file,
      int       n_volumes,
      Real      tag_volume1[],
      Real      tag_volume2[],
      Real      *weight,
      int       *structure_id,
      int       *patient_id,
      STRING    label )
  public  void  terminate_tag_file_output(
      FILE    *file )
&lt;/source&gt;

These two routines provide a more memory efficient method to output tag points.  After
opening a file, the first routine is called to initialize the output of tags.  The next
routine is repeatedly called to output a single tag point each time.  The third routine
is called to indicate the end of tag files.

==Tag Points Source Code Example==
The following is an example which reads a tag volume, removes all tags which have
negative x positions, ignores the second tag point in each set, if present, and
writes the result to a new file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #include  &lt;volume_io.h&gt;
  int  main(
      int   argc,
      char  *argv[] )
  {
      int        i, n_volumes, n_tag_points, *structure_ids, *patient_ids;
      Real       **tags1, **tags2, *weights;
      STRING     *labels;
      int        new_n_tag_points, *new_structure_ids, *new_patient_ids;
      Real       **new_tags1, *new_weights;
      STRING     *new_labels;
      /*--- input the tag file */

=Transforms=
In dealing with such tasks as inter- and intra-subject registration both within and
across imaging modalities, the concept of transformations between different coordinate
systems arises.  A module is provided to handle both linear (affine) and non-linear
transformations, and to provide input and output in a standardized Brain Imaging Centre
format, usually to filenames with the extension &lt;code&gt;.xfm&lt;/code&gt;.

To support these functions, two structure types are provided.  The first
(&lt;code&gt;Transform&lt;/code&gt;) is a four by four linear (affine) transform, which
facilitates rigid transformations, consisting of scaling, rotation, translation, and
shearing.  The second is a higher level transform
(&lt;code&gt;General_transform&lt;/code&gt;), which represents either a linear transform, a
non-linear transform (thin-plate spline), a smoothly interpolated grid transform, a
user definable transform, or a concatenation of two or more of these.

==Linear Transforms==
The linear transform functions all deal with objects whose type is
&lt;code&gt;Transform&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #define   Transform_elem( transform, i, j )
&lt;/source&gt;

Is used to set or retrieve the value of the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;'th row and
&lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;'th column of the transform, where &lt;function&gt;0&lt;=i,
j&lt;=3&lt;/function&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  make_identity_transform(
      Transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a four by four identity transform.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  transform_point(
      Transform  *transform,
      Real       x,
      Real       y,
      Real       z,
      Real       *x_trans,
      Real       *y_trans,
      Real       *z_trans )
&lt;/source&gt;

Transforms a three dimensional point by the given transform, passing back the three
transformed coordinates.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  transform_vector(
      Transform  *transform,
      Real       x,
      Real       y,
      Real       z,
      Real       *x_trans,
      Real       *y_trans,
      Real       *z_trans )
&lt;/source&gt;

Transforms a three dimensional vector by the given transform, passing back the three
transformed coordinates.  The only difference between transforming a point and a
vector is that transforming a vector does not involve the translational component of
the transform.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  inverse_transform_point(
      Transform  *transform,
      Real       x,
      Real       y,
      Real       z,
      Real       *x_trans,
      Real       *y_trans,
      Real       *z_trans )
&lt;/source&gt;

Assuming the transform is an orthogonal transform (no shear components), the point
is transformed by the inverse of the transform.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  inverse_transform_vector(
      Transform  *transform,
      Real       x,
      Real       y,
      Real       z,
      Real       *x_trans,
      Real       *y_trans,
      Real       *z_trans )
&lt;/source&gt;

Assuming the transform is an orthogonal transform (no shear components), the vector
is transformed by the inverse of the transform.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void   concat_transforms(
      Transform   *result,
      Transform   *t1,
      Transform   *t2 )
&lt;/source&gt;

Multiplies the transform &lt;code&gt;t2&lt;/code&gt; by the transform
&lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt;, storing the product in &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;. 
Transforming a point by &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to transforming
the point by &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt;, then transforming the result by
&lt;code&gt;t2&lt;/code&gt;.

==General Transforms==
General transforms can represent linear transforms, thin-plate spline transforms,
grid transforms, and user defined transforms, and concatenations of these.  All
functions dealing with general transforms involve objects of type
&lt;code&gt;General_transform&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  create_linear_transform(
      General_transform   *transform,
      Transform           *linear_transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a general transform consisting of a single linear transform, specified by
&lt;code&gt;linear_transform&lt;/code&gt;.  If a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; is passed as
the argument &lt;code&gt;linear_transform&lt;/code&gt;, then an identity transform is
created.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  create_thin_plate_transform(
      General_transform    *transform,
      int                  n_dimensions,
      int                  n_points,
      float                **points,
      float                **displacements )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a general transform consisting of a thin plate spline, which provides a
smooth non-linear mapping of a multidimensional space.  The
&lt;code&gt;points&lt;/code&gt; argument is an array of size
&lt;code&gt;n_points&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;n_dimensions&lt;/code&gt;, representing a
set of points. The &lt;code&gt;displacements&lt;/code&gt; is a
(&lt;code&gt;n_points&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;n_dimensions&lt;/code&gt; + 1) by
&lt;code&gt;n_dimensions&lt;/code&gt; array, which is created by the function
&lt;code&gt;get_nonlinear_warp()&lt;/code&gt;, which is not included in this library.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  create_grid_transform(
      General_transform    *transform,
      Volume               displacement_volume )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a general transform consisting of a grid transform, which provides a smooth
non-linear mapping of a multidimensional space.  The
&lt;code&gt;displacment_volume&lt;/code&gt; argument is a four dimensional volume
representing the displacements for the x, y, and z directions.  Three of the
dimensions of the volume must correspond to the x, y, and z spatial dimensions, and
the fourth must have exactly three components, the displacements in each direction
in world space.  The dimensions may be in any order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  typedef  void   (*User_transform_function)( void  *user_data,
                                              Real  x,
                                              Real  y,
                                              Real  z,
                                              Real  *x_trans,
                                              Real  *y_trans,
                                              Real  *z_trans )
  public  void  create_user_transform(
      General_transform         *transform,
      void                      *user_data,
      size_t                    size_user_data,
      User_transform_function   transform_function,
      User_transform_function   inverse_transform_function )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a user defined transformation, by copying the user data
(&lt;code&gt;size_user_data&lt;/code&gt; bytes of data starting at
&lt;code&gt;user_data&lt;/code&gt;).   Two function pointers are also required, to
specify the method of transforming points and inversely transforming points.  These
functions are of the type &lt;code&gt;User_transform_function&lt;/code&gt;, which is
specified above.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  delete_general_transform(
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Frees up the memory stored in the general transform structure.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Transform_types  get_transform_type(
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the general transform type, one of &lt;code&gt;LINEAR&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;THIN_PLATE_SPLINE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;USER_TRANSFORM&lt;/code&gt;, or
&lt;code&gt;CONCATENATED_TRANSFORM&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Transform  *get_linear_transform_ptr(
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

If the general transform is of type &lt;code&gt;LINEAR&lt;/code&gt;, then returns a
pointer to the linear transform (of type &lt;code&gt;Transform&lt;/code&gt;), for use
with the routines specific to linear transforms, described earlier. Otherwise prints
an error message.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  concat_general_transforms(
      General_transform   *first,
      General_transform   *second,
      General_transform   *result )
&lt;/source&gt;

Concatenates two general transforms.  If both transforms are of type
&lt;code&gt;LINEAR&lt;/code&gt;, then the result is also of this type, being the matrix
product of the two.  Otherwise, the resulting transform is simply the concatenation
of the two transforms.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  int  get_n_concated_transforms(
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns the number of concatenated transforms in the given transform.  If the type
of the transform is &lt;code&gt;CONCATENATED_TRANSFORM&lt;/code&gt;, then the number
returned is the number of transforms, otherwise it is one.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  General_transform  *get_nth_general_transform(
      General_transform   *transform,
      int                 n )
&lt;/source&gt;

If the transform is of type &lt;code&gt;CONCATENATED_TRANSFORM&lt;/code&gt;, then a
pointer to the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;'th transform is returned, where
&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is greater than or equal to zero and less than the number of
transforms in the concatenated transform.

==Using General Transforms==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  general_transform_point(
      General_transform   *transform,
      Real                x,
      Real                y,
      Real                z,
      Real                *x_transformed,
      Real                *y_transformed,
      Real                *z_transformed )
&lt;/source&gt;

Transforms a three dimensional point by a general transform, passing back the result
in the last three arguments.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  general_inverse_transform_point(
      General_transform   *transform,
      Real                x,
      Real                y,
      Real                z,
      Real                *x_transformed,
      Real                *y_transformed,
      Real                *z_transformed )
&lt;/source&gt;

Transforms a three dimensional point by the inverse of the general transform,
passing back the result in the last three arguments.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  copy_general_transform(
      General_transform   *transform,
      General_transform   *copy )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a copy of the general transform, allocating memory within the structure as
required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  create_inverse_general_transform(
      General_transform   *transform,
      General_transform   *inverse )
&lt;/source&gt;

Creates a new general transform that is the inverse of the given one.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  void  invert_general_transform(
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Changes the transform to be its inverse.  Calling it twice on the same transform is
equivalent to not calling the function at all.

==Reading and Writing General Transforms==
General transforms are stored in files in an ascii format devised at the McConnell
Brain Imaging Centre, and usually have a filename extension of
&lt;code&gt;.xfm&lt;/code&gt;.  The input and output functions are:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  output_transform_file(
      STRING              filename,
      STRING              comments,
      General_transform   *transform )
  public  Status  output_transform(
      FILE                *file,
      STRING              filename,
      int                 *volume_count_ptr,
      STRING              comments,
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions write the general transform to a file, in the appropriate
format.  The &lt;code&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt; line is an arbitrary string which is
stored in the file for documentation purposes.  Newline characters in the
&lt;code&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt; correctly result in a multi-line comment with a
comment character inserted at the beginning of each line. The first form opens the
file, with a default extension of &lt;code&gt;.xfm&lt;/code&gt;, writes the transform,
then closes the file. The second form of the function assumes the file is already
open and will later be closed.  Because the transform may contain pointers to MINC
files that define the transform, the name of the file must be passed in to this
function, to be used to create the name of the MINC files.  The volume_count_ptr
must point to an integer that has been initialized.  Each time an auxiliary MINC
file of the transform is created, the integer is used to create a unique filename,
and then the volume_count_ptr is incremented. Both functions return
&lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  Status  input_transform(
      FILE                *file,
      STRING              filename,
      General_transform   *transform )
  public  Status  input_transform_file(
      STRING              filename,
      General_transform   *transform )
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs a general transform from a file.  The first form assumes the file has already
been opened for input, and will later be closed. The second form opens the file for
input, with a default extension of &lt;code&gt;.xfm&lt;/code&gt;, reads the transform,
then closes the file.  Both functions return &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  public  STRING  get_default_transform_file_suffix()
&lt;/source&gt;

Returns a pointer to a string consisting of the default suffix for transform files,
currently &lt;code&gt;``xfm''&lt;/code&gt;.  This pointer should not be freed or its
contents modified.

=Final Source Code Example=
This is an example which attempts to illustrate a typical processing task incorporating
use of volumes, tag points, and transformations. This is a full program which, when
linked to the BIC Volume IO Library, reads two volumes in MINC format, a set of tag
points from file, and a transformation from file.  The tag points are assumed to be in
the world space of the first volume, and the transformation is assumed to transform
points in the world space of the first volume to the world space of the second volume. 
The program transforms each tag point by the transformation input (presumably
transforming from the world space of the first volume to that of the second volume),
then transforms the result to the voxel space of the second volume.  If the voxel
coordinate is within the second volume, then the value of the corresponding voxel is
printed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The current and previous members of the BIC [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/] have written and released a large number of image analysis software packages, some of these releases date back to the late 1980′s. The most recognised of these is the MINC file format, toolbox and associated tools.

The MINC file format and toolbox was originally conceived, written and released by Peter Neelin in 1992 due to the frustrations of dealing with multiple file formats from varying scanners and research groups. In the ensuing years many associated tools (image registration, normalisation, visualisation, etc.) were written and have also been released.

The original MINC file format and tools were based upon the NetCDF data format but problems were being encountered with multi-gigabyte datasets, as such a large rewrite of the library was undertaken in 2002–3 in which the data format was changed to HDF in order to support large files and other new features. This release series is called MINC2. Development work on MINC1 was halted at version 1.5.1 in 2006.
All the current MINC2 tools are backward compatible with MINC1 format, with exception of the RMINC library and pyminc (based on the MINC2 API), which cannot read MINC1 format files directly.

The current MINC2 library and tools are maintained by a group of developers in various image research labs around the world. 

&lt;!-- ==What is MINC==

MINC is not only a file format but also an Application Programming Interface (API).
   
* Idea of MINC (grand visions)
* provide an extensible interface by which automated processing can be done
* Desc of Voxel-&gt;World coords
* Desc of Voxel to Real mapping --&gt;

==Advanced image processing tools==
These include various image processing applications. Below is a small list of the most important of these programs and their applications.

'''Geometric distortion correction'''

Tools to estimate and correct for geometrical distortions caused by imaging gradient non-linearities.

'''N3'''

The N3 package, a part of MINC tools, implements a non-parametric method for correction of intensity non-uniformity in MRI data. Its use tends to be an essential first step in any processing sequence.

'''Registration tools/ANIMAL'''

This family of algorithms linearly and nonlinearly register two images to each other. The most used, '''mritotal''' registers an MRI to standard Talairach space. They are all part of the MNI AutoReg package. ANIMAL is also part of MNI Autoreg and was designed to label the major anatomical regions (the different lobes, corpus callosum, etc.) of a MRI.

'''INSECT'''

INSECT is the algorithm to separate a structural MRI into its three tissue types: white matter, gray matter, and CSF. It is available as part of the classify packages.

'''SEAL'''

SEAL stands for “Sulcal Extraction and Labelling” - which pretty much explains its use as well. 

==Pipelining tool==

Also known as PMP, it is designed to perform a series of processing steps on a large database of images. 

==Statistical analysis tools==

'''glim_image'''

glim_image is designed for performing VBM (Voxel Based Morphometry) - in other words, it is useful for examining the changes in segmented tissue matter (white matter, gray matter, CSF) as it relates to a linear model.

'''EMMA'''

EMMA (Extensible MATLAB Medical image Analysis) is a toolkit designed to ease the use of MATLAB in the analysis of medical imaging data. It provides functions for reading and writing MINC files, viewing images, performing ROI operations, and performing several popular analyses. Also, there are toolkits for performing kinetic analysis of dynamic PET rCBF (regional cerebral blood flow) and FDG data.

'''RMINC'''

MINC2 library to read and write MINC volumes in R. It also performs linear model analysis.

'''fMRI statistical analysis'''

And lastly fMRI statistical analysis is also done using matlab.

==Visualization tools==
'''MincView'''

'''Display'''

'''Register'''

'''MNI ray_trace'''

'''JIV2'''

==Licensing==

The MINC package itself and most of the associated tools are licensed under a modified BSD license. The MINC license is shown below but be aware that some packages are released under differing licences such as the GPL. Check the COPYING file in the chosen package for details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=this is a dump of an old doc from Peter Neelin from yonks ago=

The basic idea is that you call voxel_loop with a list of input files,
a list of output files and a function to call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   /* figure out input files */
   num_outputs = 2;
   output_files = &amp;argv[argc - num_output_files];
   num_inputs = argc - num_outputs - 1;
   input_files = &amp;argv[1];

   /* Set up program_data pointer */
   program_data = MALLOC(sizeof(*program_data));
   program_data-&gt;field1 = junk;

   /* Set up loop options. You can just pass it NULL if the defaults
      are okay, but I put some here as examples. */
   loop_options = create_loop_options();
   set_loop_verbose(loop_options, TRUE);
   set_loop_clobber(loop_options, FALSE);
   set_loop_datatype(loop_options, NC_SHORT, TRUE, 0.0, 32000.0);
   set_loop_copy_all_header(loop_options, FALSE);
   set_loop_buffer_size(loop_options, (long) 1024 * max_buffer_size_in_kb);

   /* Do it */
   voxel_loop(num_inputs, input_files, num_outputs, output_files, 
              history_string, loop_options, 
              voxel_function, (void *) program_data);

   /* Free loop options */
   free_loop_options(loop_options);

/******************************************************************/

#define INVALID_DATA (-DBL_MAX)

void voxel_function(void *caller_data, long num_voxels, 
                    int input_num_buffers, int input_vector_length, 
                    double *input_data[],
                    int output_num_buffers, int output_vector_length, 
                    double *output_data[],
                    Loop_Info *loop_info)
/* ARGSUSED */
{
   Program_Data *program_data;
   long ivox, num_values;
   int ibuff;
   double sum1, sum2, value;

   /* Get pointer to program data */
   program_data = (Program_Data *) caller_data;
   num_values = num_voxels * input_vector_length;

   /* Do the good stuff */
   for (ivox=0; ivox &lt; num_values; ivox++) {

      sum1 = sum2 = 0.0;
      for (ibuff=0; ibuff &lt; input_num_buffers; ibuff++) {

         /* Do something useful with the data! */
         value = input_data[ibuff][ivox];
         if (value != INVALID_DATA) {
            sum1++;
            sum2 += value;
         }

      }

      output_data[0] = sum1;
      output_data[1] = (sum1 &gt; 0.0 ? sum2/sum1 : INVALID_DATA);

   }

   return;
}
&lt;source&gt;

Of course, this is a bad example, since I am loading in a buffer for
each volume and then looping over all the buffers just once. For a lot
of input files I am doing a great deal of unnecessary buffering. For
the case where you have one pass through the data, you should set the
loop option

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
   set_loop_accumulate(loop_options, TRUE, num_extra_buffers, 
                       start_function, end_function);
&lt;/source&gt;

This causes voxel_loop to call the voxel function with only one buffer
(but once for each file). The idea is that you take the ibuff loop and
put it on the outside. However, now you need to keep track of sum1 and
sum2 in buffers - well, just use the output buffers for that
purpose. What if you only have one output file and need two buffers?
Then set num_extra_buffers to 1 - added to the one output buffer gives
two available buffers (only the first buffer is written out). The
functions start_function and end_function are used to initialize and
do final computation on the output buffers. Remember to make sure that
your final data is in the first num_outputs buffers after
end_function because that is what is written out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A step back in Time==

MINC was originally written by Peter Neelin back in the dark ages (1992). Here is his original &quot;Justification&quot; for MINC:

&lt;pre&gt;
 We have been using netCDF for over a year now for medical imaging and
 have found it to be a good basis for a file format in a development
 environment. It's great when you have to get in and muck around with
 files; I don't know what it would be like in a commercial environment
 with image databases, PACS, etc. I say that it is a good &quot;basis&quot; for a
 format because it does have some limitations, both in general and for
 medical imaging. We have developed an extension called &quot;minc&quot; (Medical
 Imaging NetCDF) that tries to overcome these limitations. I'll give
 you a brief description of the motivation for minc and what it adds to
 NetCDF.
 
 The limitations of NetCDF (in no particular order):
   1) No conventions for medical imaging : A pretty obvious one since
         NetCDF is a general data format, but one still needs to come up
         with some variable/attribute names and other conventions.
   2) Some important areas have unclear or inadequate conventions :
         The best example is scaling for images. If you put all your
         images in one byte variable (that is subscripted over time, z, y
         and x, for example), then NetCDF only allows a global scaling
         to functional values for all images. Another example would be
         the inability to specify the fact that pixels in an image are
         regularly spaced.
   3) Low-level interface only : There are lots of things missing from
         the interface at the low-level (no automatic type conversion,
         etc.), and there is no high-level interface (can I load a
         volume in one call?).
   4) Lack of generic applications : I gather that they are working on
         them, but I haven't seen any. There are no medical imaging
         specific applications. Again, no surprise, but users need
         them (resampling volumes is perhaps the most used application
         that we have).
 
 What minc gives you:
   1) Conventions for medical imaging : Attributes based loosely on
         ACR-NEMA elements (at least those that I thought were the
         most important). Dimension names, variable names, etc.
         Conventions for world coordinates (again based on ACR-NEMA).
         I haven't yet looked into DICOM (successor to ACR-NEMA), but
         I expect it to be very similar.
   2) More conventions : Image scaling. Extra attributes for dimension
         variables. Handling of unknown values (e.g. resampled pixels
         that lie outside the original volume). A scheme for a
         hierarchical ordering of data in a file.
   3a) Medium-level interface (C and Fortran) : Adds useful stuff like
         type conversion and other simple operations. Routines for
         simplifying use of some minc conventions. Automatic pixel
         conversion and image resizing (e.g. I want pixels in the
         range 0 to 200, regardless of what is in the file; I have an
         old application that insists on 256x256 images).
   3b) High-level interface (C only) : Load a volume. Get
         voxel-to-world transformation. Macros to get pixel values
         and/or functional values. General transform routines. Etc.
   4) Generic applications : Resampling, header editor, rawtominc,
         minctoraw, header info, general transform programs. I hope to
         add some more in the next few months: reshaping the image
         variable, concatenating files, smoothing images, converting
         some minc conventions to NetCDF (scaling and dimension
         coordinates).
   5) Not enough documentation yet. (3a) has some documentation, (3b)
         has no docs, (4) has some. There is no overview or easy
         introduction.
   6) Built and maintained on SGI (Irix 4). Should compile out of the
         box on SUN (SunOS 4.1.3) (without FORTRAN interface).
         Compiled on SGI (Irix 5). Compiled on VAX (VMS), but hasn't
         been tested recently (and no simple build procedure). I don't
         have access to any other machines (except an IBM RS6000 that
         isn't running properly), so that's it. I think that someone
         is giving it a shot on a PC but I haven't heard back (I tried
         to avoid problems with shorts, ints and longs, but some parts
         are bound to have problems with MS/Borland compilers - should
         work with gcc).
 
 Because of the lack of documentation in certain areas, I haven't yet
 made minc available through anonymous ftp. If you are interested, I
 can make the current version available for you.
 
 Some other notes of interest: Now that NCSA HDF has a NetCDF interface
 I want to look into that (particularly since there is explicit Mac
 support from NCSA, but not UCAR). The new Xmosaic can read NetCDF
 headers. NetCDF is really good for machines with IEEE representation,
 but apparently there are speed problems with CRAYs.
&lt;/pre&gt;

And here is his original sales pitch for MINC:

&lt;pre&gt;
 Minc (Medical Image NetCDF) came out of a frustration with a
 proliferation of image file formats within our lab. Not only did each
 modality and scanner have a different format, but almost every
 programmer had their own. One of the original design goals was to have
 a format that was general enough to keep all of the programmers and
 users of different modalities happy. As well, we wanted a standard API
 so that we could be reasonably sure that programs could exchange data
 without trouble. 
 
 The decision was made to build the format around the NetCDF general
 data format (although it was originally designed for use in the
 atmospheric physics community, it is a general data format). This
 format is reasonably simple, extremely general, self-documenting,
 easily extensible by users and portable. By simple, I mean that the
 basic data structure is a multi-dimensional array, called a
 variable. All components of a NetCDF file are named, which means that
 the format is self-documenting. The variables in a file are related to
 each other by the use of named dimensions and can have associated
 attributes (strings or numbers). This simple set of concepts is easily
 applied to a broad range of data. A standard API ensures that access
 is only done through names (so the format is easily extended by adding
 new variables and attributes) and that data are always correctly
 stored in a form that allows transparent sharing across very diverse
 machine architectures. 
 
 Minc adds to this a number of things: First of all, it adds concepts
 and conventions at a higher level that ensure that data can be
 exchanged between programs. Simple conventions like how to store
 patient or acquisition information with standard names (many of these
 fields have been borrowed from the original ACR-NEMA documentation),
 and more complex concepts like the distinction between data (voxel)
 sampling grids and real-world coordinate systems that are independent
 of images. Beyond that, it adds a medium-level library for
 facilitating the use of the conventions and for doing things like
 automatic data conversion and file decompression, a high-level library
 for encapsulating a whole dataset in a simple internal structure (a
 volume can be loaded with a single function call), and a series of
 very general file manipulation programs and generic applications.
 
 These applications include conversion from scanner formats, raw data
 import/export, resampling, averaging, simple math, concatenation,
 reshaping, lookup table conversions, transform manipulation,
 coordinate conversion. As well, many specific user applications have
 been developed: 3D display and manual segmentation, 3D display
 (tri-slice) for manual registration and image merging (fusion),
 automatic registration, blurring, statistics (within volume and across
 volumes), intensity normalization, MRI RF inhomogeneity correction,
 image simulation, image classification and the list goes on (a
 dangerous list to make since it inevitably misses things and I risk
 offending people!). Furthermore, a matlab interface has been developed
 that allows us to interact easily with the data and which helps speed
 the development and prototyping of algorithms.
 
 We have used minc to store MRI images (3D and 4D), CT images (3D), PET
 images (3D and 4D), SPECT images, macrocryotome images (very large 3D
 RGB volumes), voxel labels, voxel probability maps, statistical
 fields, N-dimensional histograms, images in fourier space, deformation
 fields, etc. Any N-dimensional grid-based scalar or vector data can be
 stored in a minc file (NetCDF has a default limit of 32 dimensions and
 minc requires at least 2 dimensions so that we can talk about an
 image). Data types include byte, short, long, float and double with
 conversions done transparently.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Peter Neelin then maintained and coded for the minc library for the next 10 years or more at which point the reins were handed over to the current group of MINC authors.

      <comment>/* Dim Photos */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen how light behaves like both a wave and a particle, yet can be proven not to be either. This idea is not limited to light, but we will start our brief look at quantum physics with light, since it is easiest to understand.

Quantum physics is the study of quanta. A quantum is, to quote Wiktionary, &quot;The smallest possible, and therefore indivisible, unit of a given quantity or quantifiable phenomenon&quot;. The quantum of light is the photon. We are not describing it as a particle or a wave, as such, but as a lump of energy which behaves like a particle and a wave in some cases. We are saying that the photon is the smallest part of light which could be measured, given perfect equipment. A photon is, technically, an elementary particle. It is also the carrier of all electromagnetic radiation. However, its behaviour - quantum behaviour - is completely weird, so we call it a quantum.

==Evidence for the Quantum Behaviour of Light==
[[Image:Nuts_nutcracker_bowl_dim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grainy image of a bowl of nuts. Much better images than this one have been taken, clearly showing that light arrives in lumps.]]

===Dim Photos===
The easiest evidence to understand is dim photographs. When you take a photo with very little light, it appears 'grainy', such as the image on the right. This means that the light is arriving at the camera in lumps. If light were a wave, we would expect the photograph to appear dimmer, but uniformly so. In reality, we get clumps of light distributed randomly across the image, although the density of the random lumps is higher on the more reflective materials (the nuts). This idea of randomness, according to rules, is essential to quantum physics.

[[Image:Photoelectric_effect.svg|thumb|left|200px|The photoelectric effect]]

===Photoelectric Effect===
The second piece of evidence is more complex, but more useful since a rule can be derived from it. It can be shown experimentally that, when light of an adequate frequency falls on a metallic surface, then the surface absorbs the light and emits electrons. Hence, a current and voltage (between the surface and a positively charged terminal nearby) are produced, which can be measured.

The amount of current produced varies randomly around a certain point. This point changes depending on the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore, if the frequency of the radiation is not high enough, then there is no current at all! If light were a wave, we would expect energy to build up gradually until an electron was released, but instead, if the photons do not have enough energy, then nothing happens. This is evidence for the existence of photons.

==The Relationship between Energy and Frequency==
The photoelectric effect allows us to derive an equation linking the frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the energy of each quantum (in this case, photons). This can be achieved experimentally, by exposing the metallic surface to light of different colours, and hence different frequencies. We already know the frequencies of the different colours of light, and we can calculate the energy each photon carries into the surface, as this is the same as the energy required to supply enough potential difference to cause the electron to move. The equation for the energy of the electron is derived as follows:

First, equate two formulae for energy:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{E}{t} = IV\,&lt;/math&gt;

Rearrange to get:

&lt;math&gt;E = ItV\,&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that:

&lt;math&gt;Q = It\,&lt;/math&gt;

So, by substituting the previous equation into the equation for energy:

&lt;math&gt;E = QV = e\Delta V\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where P = power, E = energy, t = time, I = current, V = potential difference, Q = charge, e = charge of 1 electron = -1.602 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C, ΔV = potential difference produced between anode and cathode at a given frequency of radiation. This means that, given this potential difference, we can calculate the energy released, and hence the energy of the quanta which caused this energy to be released.

Plotting frequency (on the x-axis) against energy (on the y-axis) gives us an approximate straight line, with a gradient of 6.626 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt;. This number is known as Planck's constant, is measured in Js, and is usually denoted h. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;E = hf\,&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the energy carried by each quantum is proportional to the frequency of the quantum. The constant of proportionality is Planck's constant.

==Questions==
1. How much energy does a photon with a frequency of 50kHz carry?

2. A photon carries 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt;J of energy. What is its frequency?

3. How many photons of frequency 545 THz does a 20W bulb give out each second?

4. In one minute, a bulb gives out a million photons of frequency 600 THz. What is the power of the bulb?

5. The photons in a beam of electromagnetic radiation carry 2.5μJ of energy each. How long should the phasors representing this radiation take to rotate?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. How much energy does a photon with a frequency of 50kHz carry?'''

&lt;math&gt;E = hf = 6.626 \times 50 \times 10^3 \times 10^{-34}= 3.313 \times 10^{-29}\mbox{J}\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A photon carries 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt;J of energy. What is its frequency?'''

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{10^{-30}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 1509\mbox{Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. How many photons of frequency 545 THz does a 20W bulb give out each second?'''

First calculate the amount of energy given out per. second:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\Delta E}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = Pt = 20 \times 1 = 20\mbox{J}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then, calculate the amount of energy carried by each photon:

&lt;math&gt;E = hf = 6.626 \times 545 \times 10^12 \times 10^{-34} \approx 3.61 \times 10^{-19}\mbox{J}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then divide the former by the latter to give the number of photons n:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{20}{3.61 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.54 \times 10^{19}\mbox{ photons}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. In one minute, a bulb gives out a million photons of frequency 600 THz. What is the power of the bulb?'''

First calculate the energy carried by one photon:

&lt;math&gt;E = hf = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 600 \times 10^{12} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-19}\mbox{J}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then work out the energy carried by 1,000,000 photons:

&lt;math&gt;E = 10^6 \times 3.98 \times 10^{-19} = 3.98 \times 10^{-13}\mbox{J}&lt;/math&gt;

Then work out the power of the bulb:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\Delta E}{t} = \frac{3.98 \times 10^{-13}}{60} = 6.63 \times 10^{-15}\mbox{W}&lt;/math&gt;

...maybe its a nanobulb.

'''5. The photons in a beam of electromagnetic radiation carry 2.5μJ of energy each. How long should the phasors representing this radiation take to rotate?'''

First calculate the frequency of each photon:

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{2.5 \times 10^{-6}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 3.77 \times 10^{27}\mbox{Hz}&lt;/math&gt; (That's one nasty gamma ray.)

Then calculate the time taken for one 'wavelength' to go by:

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{3.77 \times 10^{27}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-28}\mbox{s}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bug House or &quot;Siamese Chess&quot; is a dynamic four player [[../|variant]] in which teams of two players compete across two simultaneous games, one pair of players per board.

Winning is achieved by traditional [[W:checkmate|checkmate]] as in standard chess, or via chess clock flag, as often a position results in which one game would result in mate, thus the losing player would prefer to halt his play in hopes his partner will reign in his sibling game.

Each team is comprised of one player as black, one white, competing thus in an opposite-colored game mirrored by the opposing team. The game is dynamic in that any pieces captured by one player is thus available to his partner to inject (or &quot;drop&quot;) into his own game at will, in lieu of a regular move.

Strong teams thus will communicate with each other as to which pieces are highly desirable to &quot;feed&quot; the leader game, or likewise to &quot;starve&quot; the opposing team by denying any material to be captured.

== Drop Checkings ==

One major division in rules for this variant is whether dropped pieces may result in checking the King or not. As may be noted in Japanese [[/Chess/Variant/Shogi|shogi]], dropped pieces cannot directly check the king, however in bughouse this certainly expedites the game and its energy level.

Likewise, in this manner, the Knight becomes a highly coveted piece as its checks cannot be blocked, and should be conserved for such play where its unique abilities are maximized.

== Crazyhouse ==

Crazyhouse is a single board, two-player version of Bughouse. The chief distinction in the rules of Crazyhouse from those of Bughouse is that promoted pieces, if captured, revert back to pawns, whereas in Bughouse, captured promoted pieces remain the same. This difference significantly alters the learning and playing experience of each variant.

Note that in Crazyhouse games, when a piece is promoted, one should keep track of which piece(s) are promoted pawns to be aware of the results of capturing particular pieces.

{{:uim/Navigation}}
Some of the terms associated specifically with input methods in general and uim in particular are not very common and, therefore, will be new to many users. Below is a short glossary of terms to help clarify this documentation.

== Bridge ==
A ''bridge'' is a glue code between applications and ''uim''. These bridges divert character input (e.g. from keypresses) to ''uim'' where it is translated into different characters according to some predefined rules.

Because applications handle input differently these require specialized bridges. See [[Uim/Manual#Bridges|the manual]] for description of available bridges.

== Candidate ==
A ''candidate'' is a word which can be substituted for the current ''[[Uim/Glossary#Pre-edit|pre-edit]]''.

Frequently a ''pre-edit'' will have several candidate words to which it can be converted. The word is then entered phonetically and candidate characters listed for the user to choose from.

Some ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method|input methods]]'' don't use conversion candidates. ''Byeoru'' and ''PRIME'' are examples of these.

== Commit ==

''Commit'' refers to the string of selected ''[[Uim/Glossary#Candidate|candidates]]'' which ''uim'' (libuim, to be precise) finally passes to the application.

== Input context ==
''Input context'' is a unit of inputting.
{{:uim/todo|This means nothing to me.}}
Normally, each text widget has one context. But in some applications, multiple text widgets share one input context. (e.g. Mozilla.)

''Input context'' is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;''context''&quot;.

== Input method framework ==
An ''input method framework'' is software that receives input from an application, and delegates it to an ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method|input method]]'' for modification before being passed back to the application. ''Uim'' is an ''input method framework''.

== Input method ==
An ''input method'' is software that modifies input according to certain rulesets. An ''input method'' can be interactive, allowing the user to choose one of a list of modifications. See [[Uim/Introduction#Input method implementations|the introduction]] for a list of ''input methods'' that are compatible with ''uim''.

== Plugin ==
A ''plugin'' is a mechanism to extend ''uim'' 's Scheme interpreter with C. Mainly used to write a glue code between ''uim'' and ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method|input methods]]''.
{{:uim/todo|What is this exactly? examples?}}

== Pre-edit ==

A ''pre-edit'' is a string that has been typed, but not yet been passed to an application.

The ''pre-edit'' is displayed (usually at the cursor position) but formatted in some way (typically with underline or reversed background colour) to inform the user about the input state of the ''[[#Input context|input context]]''.

In the case of some ''input methods'' (such as those for Latin and Korean scripts) the ''pre-edit'' gets converted and committed as soon as the final character that determines the result is entered. In others (such as those for Chinese and Japanese), where the input does not uniquely determine the outcome, a list of [[#Candidate|candidates]] is provided for the user to choose from.

A long ''pre-edit'' may be broken down into ''[[#Segment|segments]]'' for more convenient conversion.

== Segment ==
&lt;!--&lt;old&gt;In uim, segment often means a segmented part of a sentence. For example, in Anthy, converting-phase pre-edit is represented as a sequence of one or more segments that hold a phrase respectively. A segment provides a unit which per-segment operations can be applied to.&lt;/old&gt;
{{:uim/todo|What do you mean by &quot;often&quot;?}}--&gt;

A ''[[Uim/Glossary#Pre-edit|pre-edit]]'' is broken down into ''segments'' when the ''pre-edit'' contains one or more sub-strings that can have their own list of ''[[Uim/Glossary#candidate|candidates]]''. Each ''segment'' is then operated on individually.

Essentially, a ''segment'' is the smallest part of a ''pre-edit'' that could be a ''pre-edit'' and yield results. Since ''candidate'' combinations grow roughly exponentially with ''pre-edit'' length, breaking them down into ''segments'' makes the selection of the desired ''candidate'' much faster.
&lt;!--
For example, a ''preedit'' with three ''segments''. The first has three ''candidates'', the second has six, and the third has seven. The combined number of ''candidate'' combinations could be up to a hundred-and-twenty-six ''candidates''.--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I love chess and so I found out about this site via my research into chess openings :)

In particular, I love chess variants and international &amp; historical chess versions too.

I am not so good at wiki editing codes, so if you see something I didn't do right please let me know how to fix it. In particular cross linking to other sections and redirecting, etc. I'm sure over time I'll get the hang of it!

==Hello==
Thanks for making the Bughouse page. I updated what links I could. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] &lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate metadata&quot; id=&quot;stub&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#cef2e0;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

==Rational Drug Design==
[[w:en:Serendipity#Pharmacology|Serendipity]] has, for a very long time, been a driving force in the Drug Design and Development process. A shift towards rationalization of the process has begun, accompanying the increasing understanding of corresponding areas such as human as well as pathogen biochemistry and pathophysiology. In a broad and general way the rational drug design approach involves a comprehensive study of the affected biochemical pathways, identification of key elements (generally proteins) and designing small molecules to modify/manipulate the functions of these proteins.
Most of the approaches are target oriented and hence '''''structure based''''' i.e. drug targets are identified which is typically a component (a protein or some other biomolecule) of a relevant pathway

==Structure based Drug Design==

===Overview===
In the early 1980s, researchers were not able to take advantage of structure-based methods in the drug discovery process. This was due to a number of factors, the most important of which were a lack of computing power and docking programs that could test potential models as well as a lack of interest in the established community do in part to the aforementioned lack of tools.  However, in the 1990s, computing power and available programs increased exponentially as well as the ability to obtain cheaper, more reliable x-ray crystallographic structures necessary for any type of computational study.  This marked the start of a new era and the first attempts and successes were published, with the two most famous being the [[w:en:Hiv_protease_inhibitors|HIV-1 protease inhibitors]] and [[w:en:Renin|renin]] inhibitors (to combat hypertension) (Lunney). In contemporary drug discovery, structure-based methods are an integral part of the drug development process. This change can be attributed to the rapid advances in genomics and structural biology, as well as developments in information technology. The advancements of technology in several fields that are vital to the drug discovery process increased the pace of drug development. However,  many years of research are still required until a drug which is both effective and tolerated by the human body is marketable (Anderson).  Despite this new technology and increased funding by pharmeaceutical companies, the issues with finding safe, effective compounds have resulted in there being no significant increase in the rate of therapeutic agent release to the general public. (Lindsay)

===Approaches to Structure Based Drug Design===
====The ''de novo'' approach====
The ''de novo'' approach involves constructing novel drug molecules from the scratch based on the receptor/target structure. This is a particularly challenging task, considering that the search space of potentially feasible structures is to the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; (Bohacek). The fundamentals of ''de novo'' drug design include assembling drug like compounds, evaluating their potential and also searching the sample space for such compounds. &lt;br&gt;
The design of the drug molecule is generally driven by the receptor structure or more specifically it’s hypothetical interaction with the structure of the receptor. Therefore, modeling the binding site to the greatest possible degree of accuracy is one of the critical steps in the process. Once the binding site is defined, the next step is to place atoms or small molecule within it and evaluate the fit/ interaction. This is done using a scoring function. Depending on the software package used, there now exists a wide variety of scoring functions ranging from simple steric constraints to functions that approximate and evaluate binding free energy. The scoring functions are also responsible for guiding the growth and optimization of structures by assigning fitness values to the evaluated structures.&lt;br&gt;
Different ways of constructing complete ligand molecules (''in silico'') include linking, growing (Figure 1), random structure change, and [[w:en:Molecular_dynamics|molecular dynamics]] based methods. &lt;br&gt;
'''Linking:''' Atoms, functional groups or fragments are placed at pre-determined interaction sites and are joined together to yield a complete molecule. The linking groups may be either pre-defined or generated on the fly in compliance with the constraints.&lt;br&gt;
'''Growing:''' A single building block is chosen as a starting point or seed and placed in the interaction site of the receptor. Fragments or other groups are added to provide feasible interactions with the residues in the site. This process is continued until all fragments have been integrated into a single molecule. &lt;br&gt;
'''Molecular Dynamics:''' The initial fragments are scattered randomly in the interaction site and then allowed to rearrange using Molecular dynamics simulations. Scoring functions are used to evaluate the resultant structures. 
One of the major drawbacks of ''de novo'' algorithms is that they generally ignore synthetic feasibility of the designed structures.  &lt;br&gt;

====The Lead optimization approach====
The Lead optimization approach involves the modification and optimization of existing analogues (drug candidates) that demonstrate therapeutic potential. This technique is based on the study of the interaction between ligands and receptors. The data thus obtained is used to guide the modification of the structures of selected molecules or compounds. A large number of analogues are created and then screened through thereby improving efficacy and other desirable properties

===Drug Target Selection and Identification of the Target Site===
	The selection of the drug target is mainly based on biological and biochemical considerations.  Proteomics as a tool in this area is still relatively limited due to the sheer complexity of protein expression in any given cell.  Despite this, proteomics’ usefulness has grown in other areas of the drug discovery process including biomarker identification and tracking.  The ideal drug target for structure-based drug design should bind a small molecule and should be closely associated with the disease.  The small molecule then either changes the function of the drug target, or in case of a pathogenic organism, inhibits the function of the target.  This will ideally lead to the cell death of the pathogen. In the latter case, the drug target should only be present in the diseased cells or pathogen and should have a unique function that allows for and encourages this selectivity. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the drug target guarantees that another pathway cannot restore the function of an inhibited target. The structure-based search for anti-cancer and autoimmune drugs is much more challenging, since the drug targets regulate essential cell functions. Hence, these targets are not unique and isolated; inhibition of their function not only affects mutant or over/under-activated cells, but also normal cells.  For example, the [[w:en:pi3k|phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3K) pathway is both involved in cellular growth and has been directly linked with pancreatic cancer activation (Reddy). Trying to separate convoluted pathways such as this make the drug discovery process much more complex than with other diseases.  Another option for targeting in cancer is DNA.  [[w:en:cisplatin|Cisplatin]] and [[w:en:bleomycin|Bleomycin]] cross-link and cleave DNA respectively and are used to slow down cell division, particularly in cancerous tissues. (Singh) 

	The ligand binding site of a drug target should be a pocket containing both hydrogen donors and acceptors, as well as hydrophobic residues.  In many cases, the selected target location is the active site of an enzyme, as with sildenafil citrate (Viagra), which targets the catalytic subunit of NADPH (Jeremy); however, it can also be an assembly or regulatory site, as is the case with the phosphotransferase regulatory domain the Bacillus subtilis Spo0f protein, a histidine kinase (Dai-Fu). Even protein-protein interaction sites, which are often large and planar, have been selected as target sites (2-oxoglutarate, a naturally occurring molecule, affects the monomer-monomer interactions of GlnK, an ammonia transporter [AcrB] inhibitor (Anderson, Stroud).
 
===Proteomics as a Tool to Discover Biomarkers===
‘Biomarker’ is short for ‘biological marker.’  A biomarker is a molecule, indicator, or test that can be used to measure such processes as disease progression, infection stage, and drug efficacy, as well as other various biological functions.  They can also be used as part of safety studies for therapeutic agents.  Although the most common biomarkers in use today are small molecules and proteins, the growing fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are attempting to utilize [[w:en:genotype|genotypes]], [[w:en:haplotype|haplotypes]], and [[w:en:Single_nucleotide_polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] as biomarkers  (Frank).

With the growing emphasis on biomarkers as indicators, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)[http://www.nih.gov/] began a ‘Biomarkers and Surrogate Endpoint Working Group.’[http://ospp.od.nih.gov/biomarkers/ClinicalParmacology.pdf]  This organization has set up a classification system for biomarkers. &lt;br&gt; 
'''Type 0 biomarkers''' are more symptomatic in nature and track disease progression over its complete history.  They are used in phase 0 clinical studies.  These clinical studies use well developed assay techniques in highly regulated populations for specific durations.  The goal of these studies is to achieve simple positive or negative results for the drug or system being studied.  &lt;br&gt;
'''Type 1 biomarkers''' are used to track any type of compound injected into the biological system.  The most familiar aspects are drug trials, where the researchers are looking for a specific effect.  The effect observed may be positive or negative. &lt;br&gt; 
'''Type II biomarkers''' are used to determine a ‘surrogate endpoint.’  A surrogate endpoint, as defined by the FDA,[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/fast.html] “''is a marker – a laboratory measurement or physical sign – that is used in the therapeutic trials as a substitute for a clinically meaningful endpoint that is a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions or survives and is expected to predict the effect of the therapy.''”  In other words, a surrogate endpoint moves beyond the concept of a single biomarker and into the realm where many or no biomarkers may be sufficient.  Other symptoms including overall health and mortality may be studied to determine the efficacy of a treatment regimen.  Although surrogate endpoints are still in the early stages, two examples that have been accepted are blood pressure and cholesterol, which have a firm connection to cardiovascular health and mortality (Frank). 

	In addition to the above effects, a biomarker should correlate well with the disease condition and minimize the number of false positives, as well as false negatives. Thus, a biomarker should be able to accurately discriminate between a normal and an infected condition with high reproducibility. The challenge in proteomics research is to identify unique biomarkers from complex biological mixtures that unequivocally correlate with the disease condition. Biomarkers can be utilized for many purposes. Also, established biomarkers are useful as risk factor indicators, capable of providing information to show that a person is susceptible to a disease.  [[w:en:wt_interval|QT]] prolongation, a measure of change in the ventricular electrical cycle, is used as a assessment of a patient’s chances for survival after heart attack, as is [[w:en:troponin_t|troponin T]], a cardiac enzyme whose levels rise following a heart attack.  [[w:en:5-hydroxytryptophan|5-hydroxytryptophan]] is a metabolic precursor to seratonin, and has been found to localize around neoplasms in neuroendocrine tissue.  Labelling of these molecules allows for visualization of these events by [[w:en:fdg-pet|fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography]] (FDG-PET), which is used in visualizing many types of malignancies.  Another PET application uses SPA-RQ, a neurokinin-1 binder, whose injection is used to track binding of the drug [[w:en:aprepitant|Aprepitant™]], a drug used in chemotherapy patients to control vomiting (Frank). 

	There are currently many more biomarkers being studied and in development, and this number will continue to grow as our understanding of the body evolves.  The combination of tracer molecules and imaging techniques, as in 5-hydroxytryptophan, creates a powerful method for visualizing areas that should not be touched surgically except as a last resort.  The growing use of proteomics to find biomarkers is important as well.  Recent advances in analytical techniques such as [[Proteomics/Protein_Identification_-_Mass_Spectrometry|mass spectrometry]] and [[Proteomics/Protein_Separations_-_Chromatography|column chromatography]] have allowed for more comprehensive studies of protein expression.  In addition, [[Proteomics/Protein_Separations-_Electrophoresis/Two_Dimensional_Polyacrylamide_Gel_Electrophoresis%282D-PAGE%29|2-dimensional electrophoresis]] provides an overall view of expression, in similar fashion to gene studies.  Proteomics studies using these techniques have identified ovarian cancer, macular degeneration, and lipoprotein composition.  Development of these techniques will undoubtedly increase in the future (Frank).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''professional wrestling referee''' is the offical figure in pro wrestling that makes the rules and enforces them.
There are different types of refs:
*''Secondary Ref''- is the ref that sits at ring side and enters the ring if the other ref gets knocked down.
**''Guest Ref''-is a ref that is chosen to ref in a match.
**''Alien Ref''-is a ref that is chosen out of that business.
**''Heel Ref''-is a bad guy ref who lets the wrestlers in the match do whatever they want.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Europe-Armenia.svg|thumb|280px|right|Map showing location of Armenia (green) in Europe]]
'''Armenia''' is a small country located in eastern Europe and western Asia.  Its neighbours are [[Wikijunior:Europe/Turkey|Turkey]], [[../Georgia|Georgia]], [[../Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] and Iran.  The capital of Armenia is '''[[w:Yerevan|Yerevan]]'''.  Other cities in Armenia are Gyumri and Vanadzor.  The currency of Armenia is the Dram.

==Armenia's History==
Armenia is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. Over the centuries Armenia has been taken over by many people including Russia, Greeks, and the Romans. '''On September 23, 1991 Armenia finally claimed its independence''' from the Soviet Union.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Soviet Union|The Soviet Union was a communist country which included 15 modern-day countries including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine and many others}}

==Armenia's Geography==

The total land area of Armenia is 11,506 sq mi (29,800 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the population is 3 100 236.

Armenia has many mountain lakes, the largest being '''Lake Sevan''', which is located in the North-eastern part of the country. Lake Sevan is a popular resort area. The Aras river is the largest and longest river in Armenia. It starts off in the mountains of Turkey and flows along Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran.

The climate of Armenia is mostly dry with long, hot summers and average winters. The sun shines most of the time in Armenia which causes the dry climate, but they do receive heavy rains. The heavy rains occur most often in Autumn or Fall.

==Armenia's People==
[[Image:Flag of Armenia.svg|thumb|border|280px|left|The flag of Armenia.]]
[[Image:Blick_über_den_Sewansee.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Lake Sevan in Gegharkunik, Armenia]]
Over half of Armenia's population live in cities or towns. You can find most of the population near the river valleys. 

The Major Nationalities in Armenia are Armenian, Russian, and Kurds. Nearly 98 percent of the People in Armenia speak [[Wikijunior:Languages/Armenian|Armenian]]. The other spoken languages in the country are [[Wikijunior:Languages/Russian|Russian]] and Yezidi. The Armenian's were converted to [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christianity]] in the 4th century. Today Christianity is still the most practiced religion there. There are also Russian Orthodox Christians, Protestants, and Muslims.

Most Armenian's can read and write. While Armenia was under the control of the Soviet Union the government in Moscow was in control of the educational system. They believed in free and universal education. Today primary and secondary education is required and are available for free. The country's largest university is Yerevan State University, founded in 1919 in Yerevan.

==Armenia's Sights==
In the past 5 years tourism has become more important to the Armenian economy. Lake Sevan, shown in the picture to the left, is one of the sights that you can see when you go to Armenia. It is the largest lake in the country and that makes it a very popular tourist attraction. You can also visit the monasteries and churches, or some of its very old castles. Armenia has '''4 [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]''' which include monasteries and churches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This topic is going to be quite tough to write as there are references to all sorts of things:

- Interfaces
- Abstract Classes
- Properties
- Methods

- Reference Types
- Value Types

I've started with a basic introduction to ease readers in without overloading them with concepts (or tried to).

After explaining System.Object, the next route would be to describe reference and value types in more details.

What else would be needed to pad out the &quot;objects&quot; sections. Remoting objecs work differently too!

This could have been tagged as a speedy delete, but I think we should not only attempt to give the creator a reason for the deletion (in this case he is a unregistered user) and attempt to save the will to contribute to the Wikibooks project.
That said this page was without doubt the beginning of a [[WB:GUIDE#Wikibooks_is_not_for_video_game_strategy_guides|game guide]] and such content is not fit for Wikibooks (as policy dictates), however there are other repositories that would benefit from such works like the [http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Main_Page Strategywiki].
The content doesn't seem sufficient to be saved in a transwiki or into another book, for instance into the [[Video Game Design]] but maybe other users can provide an alternative to the deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:52, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Traditional classifications of soils==
'''Colour'''
* Colourless/white: high silica content
* Light/white: lack of oxygen; leached; high calcium; alkaline ph
* Yellow: lack of oxygen; high clay content; aluminium &amp; iron
* Red: iron oxide
* Red/brown: volcanic basalt origin; iron &amp; magnesium
* Black: rich in organic matter &amp; nutrients; holds moisture

'''vegetation'''
* Azalea, dandelion: acid soils; usually leached; often 
* berries, conifers, dock: compacted with poor drainage
* saltbush, spinifex: alkaline; saline; dry soils
* nettles, clovers, vetch: excess nitrogen; low humus content; low microrganism content 
* blackberries: open disturbed soil, possibly acid
* bracken: recent fire; general decline in soil fertility.      
* buttercup: poor drainage, acid.
* thistles: low calcium &amp; iron content; hard soils.
* chicory, chickweed, clover, groundsel: good fertility

'''parent material'''
Eg soils derived from:
* Sandstone: sandy, high silica.          
* Shale: clay; high silica &amp; iron.
* Basalt: high iron &amp; magnesium.

'''smell'''
* Sour: Lacks oxygen, acidic, sulphur dioxide
* Sweet &amp; earthy: high oxygen, good soil life &amp; OM
* Garlic: arsenic in soil.

'''taste'''
* Smooth &amp; slippery: acidic, soil water lathers easily
* Weak soda: alkaline/mineral; won’t lather easily

'''soil life'''
* Worms: good moisture, OM, low pesticide residues
* Ants: drier, sandy
* Slugs &amp; snails: damp, decomposing plant &amp; animal material.
* Skinks &amp; lizards: warm sunny, dry spots, good insect populations

'''water'''
* Run –off: is increased by bare ground, compaction, steep slopes
* Repels water: compacted, eroded, excessive use of dolomite, very little OM, sandy &amp; allowed to dry out &amp; has formed a moisture resistant barrier
* Shrinks &amp; swells: high clay, holds water, cracks.
* Fast draining: hole filled with water, drains within 10mins: erodes easily, collapses easily, few fungal diseases, good movement of water &amp; soil life. Not good for dams.

'''history'''
* Bare ground: agricultural or industrial contamination.
* Growth in poor soils:previous structures, compaction, old poultry or animal pen site
* No topsoil:quarry or fill site, erosion.
* Bad cracks &amp; rubbish:old tip or landfill site

==plants and soil minerals==

Often plants which grow in deficient soils have the ability to concentrate those missing elements in their structure.

Potassium present ~ marshmallow, knapweed, wormwood, opium poppy, fumitory, tansy &amp; borage. Deficient ~ red clover. Celery &amp; leek like potassium. Chicory is potassium rich.

Calcium ~ buckwheat grown as a green manure or composted adds. Melon leaves are a source of it &amp; oak bark is especially rich as are all thistles &amp; willow. Dandelion “mines” it. Peas, beans, brassicas &amp; turnips need it.

Phosphorous ~ bracken indicates a lack of it &amp; accumulates it. Burn it &amp; spread the ashes. Valerian &amp; comfrey are rich sources. Whitefly indicates a deficiency along with magnesium. Brassicas need it to head well.

Iron ~ blackberry is a rich source.

Magnesium &amp; sulphur ~ broom, salad burnett, plantain, &amp; sheep sorrel (for magnesium)

Ragwort ~ copper

Thistles ~ nitrogen, copper &amp; silicon.


==Creating resources on your land==

* Plant mulch making plants ~ comfrey, tree lucerne, grasses for hay, weeds such as dandelion, plantain, nettles, borage, deciduous trees.
* Use small prunings as part of the mulch around your trees. Place them over soil that you need to add organic matter like grass clippings, weeds, &amp; manure on top &amp; let nature do the rest. Once it’s reasonably broken down sow seeds/plant. Good way to establish areas for under-planting an orchard/food forest.
* Harvest local resources ~ bracken &amp; chicory are high in potassium, add it to your compost, burn it &amp; use the ashes around plants such as, celery &amp; leeks. The brassicas (cabbage, cauli, broccoli, brussels) need phosphorous to head up well, comfrey &amp; bracken supply it. Ragwort concentrates copper. Broom is high in magnesium &amp; sulphur, lupins in nitrogen &amp; calcium. Seaweed has many of the essential trace elements that plants need. Food scraps from cafes &amp; super markets add to the mix for your compost.

==Other Strategies==
* Plant wind breaks to filter air-born pollution and prevent soil erosion.
* Plant trees &amp; shrubs to take up ground water pollution e.g. alongside a road, runoff from your neighbour who uses chemicals. The leaf litter from deciduous trees and shrubs also adds organic material to the top layer of your soils. Over time this will be a significant addition.
* Create wetlands planted with macrophytes (reeds &amp; rushes) to take up the above pollution.
* Use raised beds for growing in.
* Seaweed, compost &amp; dolomite help to clean soils of pollutants such as heavy metals.
* Allow weeds to grow ~ add OM, take up pollutants.
* Spread rock dust to supply minerals ~ basalt, granite, dolomite.
* Where practical, change the contour of slopes to create swales so that water does not run off as quickly and cause erosion.
* Don't leave bare soil, plant something instead -- or at least lay down some mulch.
* Remember that the more conditions you create for soil life to thrive the better your soils will be. Create diversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Water==
*pressure knocks insects off.
*with lime added &amp; applied around beets &amp; cabbage, scab,  
*clubroot &amp; cabbage is reduced.
*Warm 54deg. C. for soft skinned insects ,aphids &amp; caterpillars.

==Milk==
*control sprays on tomatoes, cucumber &amp; lettuce. Spray at planting time &amp; then every 10 days, 1 part milk to 9 parts water.
*Buttermilk is good for red spider mites. Add1/2 teacup b’milk to 4cups flour &amp; 5gal. water.( an old recipe!)

==Soap==
*dissolve 2 tsp pure soap eg LUX, in 1lt water (you can use old soapy water from washing clothes), or use soft soap not ordinary soap (caustic soda) &amp; dissolve 225gr in 9lt water. For aphids, white butterfly &amp; caterpillars.

==Ground rock dust==
*mix water, flour &amp; soap &amp; sprayed on leaves. Deters soft bodied insects as sharp.

==Crushed clay==
*dust on to repel caterpillars.

==Vege cooking oils==
*paint on or mix with water to spray on for aphids, whitefly &amp; mealy bugs.

==Fish emulsion==
*repels many insects &amp; fertilises plants.       
                              
==Other methods==
* Wormwood cuttings put them over brassicas to camouflage &amp; repel.
* Give plants susceptible to whitefly, comfrey liquid or use the leaves as a mulch &amp; in your compost. Whitefly occurs when potash levels are low. Wood ash &amp; rock phosphate also helps.
*You will see that you will need nozzles on your sprayer that can cope with the thicker mixes. They need to be used quickly, not stored.These sprays work by various means ~ smothering, deterring &amp; dissolving insects protective shells.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Some main points==
* Don't panic! Take your time.
* Remember the forest &amp; how it keeps a balance. The web of life. Take a walk in one whenever you need a refresher course.
* Everything gardens.
* Observe what’s eating what &amp; when in your garden.
* Let them eat some! What can you accept?
* Plagues are indicators of gross imbalance.
* Too many pests? No ~ too few predators                                            , or poor plant health, or soil health, or care of plants, or selection of plants, or lack of diversity, above &amp; below ground (of animals, plants, habitats, insects &amp; birds)

==Respect insects we need them in our gardens==
What do they do? ~ fertilise, aerate, decompose, add nutrients, provide food for birds, animals &amp; other insects (us too if only we would try them!), prune ( tribal gardeners have used insects to increase the yields of their crops by putting insects on their plants at certain times!), destroy weak plants &amp; so help with natural selection, help plants through symbiotic relationships. 

==Plants can protect themselves==
Some secrete enzymes when chewed which affects the insects digestion &amp;/or their ability to reproduce. Others produce chemicals which smell like the alarm signals put out by insects being eaten. Trees in Africa being eaten by animals send signals to neighbouring trees &amp; those trees secrete substances that make them unpalatable!

*Create a seed bank in your soil. Let plants spread their seed &amp; select the strongest.
* Use your own instincts to help you to see what’s needed in your garden.                                                                                                  

==Some plants to encourage predators==
* Let carrot, radish, parsnips, fennel &amp; brassicas flower, even if you aren’t collecting seed.
* Phacelia tanacetifolia, (Fiddleneck),Solidago canadensis (Goldenrod), Asters (Michmaelmas or Easter Daisy) Alyssum maritimum (Sweet Alice) all supply nectar for predators.

Generally introduce as many flowering plants into, &amp;/or plant them around your garden. Do some research to work out which one’s to plant to extend the flowering season.                               

Spraying with even botannical sprays should be a last resort as these too can kill your beneficial insects.

==Some design strategies==     
* Sun~trap hedge, repellant or attractant.
* Camouflage plantings.
* Clump plantings rather than rows.
* Trees &amp; shrubs as flight barriers &amp; wide (1/2 ~ 1mtr) rows of repellant plants
* Create habitats ~ ponds, perches, shelters, warm, wind free micro climates.

==Further reading==

*Organic Plant Protection ~ Rodale Press, Inc.
*Permaculture Home Garden ~ Linda Woodrow
*Organic Gardening ~ Peter Bennett.

Do you need help with this page? I'm not quite sure what you're trying to accomplish here, but I'm available to help if you need it. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:12, 26 April 2008 (UTC)

:Hello Mike, yes! any help would be greatly appreciated. I just tried to explain the objective of the text in the intro. But under it all is me simply using the book to add notes and handouts I get while studying permaculture. Did you have something in mind? I just noticed that I can't move a page. I tried, but it returned an error saying I can't move a page over itself.. even though I DID give it a new name. I was trying to move a subpage to the same level but with a new subpage name. No worries now, I simply orphaned the page and cut the content onto the new page. --[[User:Leighblackall|Leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 23:25, 26 April 2008 (UTC)
::OK, if you orphan a page, and it's no longer needed (is that the one below?) mark it with {{tlx|delete|short reason for deletion}} and an admin will take care of it.
::At [[Permaculture design/How to/Planting schedules/A planting schedule for Dunedin New Zealand]] you stated that it was &quot;Originally compiled by Jenny Hayden from Waitati&quot; - do you have permission to include the text here? If so, please forward permission to permissions-en@wikimedia.org so our [[m:OTRS|OTRS]] team can verify it. Also, this page is a duplicate of [[Permaculture design/How to/Planting schedules/A planting schedule for Dunedin New Zealand]]; which one do you want to keep?
::You can't move a page over an existing page; only admins can (we can delete pages). So if you run into that problem, grab an admin.

== Finding help ==

Hey Leighblackall,

I stumbled across &quot;Sustainable Business/Executive summary&quot;, where you had replaced the content with &quot;please delete&quot;. I deleted the page, but next time you should draw attention to the page by putting the appropriate tag on it. See [[Help:Deleting pages]] for more.

There are actually a number of help pages here on the wiki. The &quot;[[Help:Contents|Help]]&quot; link in the navigation bar below the logo (in the old skin at least) will list a few of the most useful ones. Please let us know if these are unclear or hard to find. Thanks and happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:48, 22 January 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks Swift. Will do in future. [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]])

Adrignola, can I structure a book flat? In other words, bring the chapters out from being subpages and share the same primary level of the book title? [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:58, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;[[w:WP:TPS]]&gt; Per [[WB:Naming policy]], no. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:42, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:The term flat and deep in the context of Wikibooks only refer to how many levels under the root pages are.  Flat would be everything just under the root.  They cannot share the same level or they are entirely different books.  This is the single biggest structural difference between Wikibooks and any other Wikimedia project and is also the key factor that allows it to have unlimited growth.  Unlike Wikipedia, with a single definitive entry on each subject, as long as you ensure a unique title for a book, you can have as many ''subpages'' as you like for it.   &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:10, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

::AFAIK, Wikiversity also uses subpages. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:13, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:::They can use them, but they don't require them, and in normal practice, I notice that the majority of their pages do not use them. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:52, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

Is there the template extension where I can control the title of a page so it doesn't as a directory? In wikieducator they use {{mytitle}}. Leigh

:Here that template is {{tl|displaytitle}}. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:03, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

== Venue ==

Greetings.  I'm just curious as to why Wikibooks was your chosen venue for adding recent content, as opposed to wikieducator.org, which I see is sponsored by Otago Polytechnic.  If there's something we're doing right, I'd be interested to know, so we can continue to foster that in the project's development and not end up like Wikiversity. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:43, 28 July 2010 (UTC)

:Sorry for the delayed response.. 
:Wikibooks has always been the preferred venue for textbook projects, for me and others at Otago Polytechnic. See [[Anatomy and Physiology of Animals]], [[Permaculture Design]], [[Sustainable Business]], and now [[Open Education Practices: A User Guide for Organisations]]. Otago Polytechnic technically sponsors the [http://wikieducator.org/WikiEducator:OER_Foundation Open Education Resource Foundation], which unfortunately (in my view) focuses solely on the use of Wikieducator.. though I see that the OER Foundation confuses this in its branding, implying a direct sponsorship of Wikieducator... OPs management would probably agree that they distribute their educational efforts across as many projects as practicable and appropriate. Wikibooks being entirely appropriate for text books and the like, but I haven't worked there for a year, it could be they have fallen back into the common mistake of parochial centralisation.

:It has always been my view that Wikieducator be a transitional project, delivering educators into the larger Wikimedia Foundation projects, as well as using other social media platforms. I think Wikieducator however, diverts many educators away from contributing to WMF projects sadly. I don't work for Otago Polytechnic any more, nor do I contribute much to WE.. I guess that's one person who has transitioned. I am finishing off a few projects for Otago Poly under contract, such as [[Open Education Practices: A User Guide for Organisations]], and deliberately using Wikibooks, because this project is exactly that. 

:Besides all that, Wikibooks - like all the WMF projects, has the benefit of a much larger expert community of practice with a greater range of cultural diversity. It has robust technical features and support, exciting partnerships in development (PediaPress, Usability Project, WikiMobile), and direct links to Wikipedia and Commons. Of course I'd have to acknowledge the sadder side of WMF, specifically the culture of deletionism, hierarchy and unwelcoming custodians, that has caused great hostility towards and from otherwise righteous contributors. Some of this has spilled over into Wikiversity, such as the measures taken by Jimbo in support of deletionism, severely disrupting the Wikiversity community base twice. I'm confident that Wikiversity will recover from this, but they need the love and support from the other WMF projects, a return to intellectual freedom, as well as a sense of shared responsibility from all the WMF projects for what has developed in the community over-all. 

:My work in educational development is now with the University of Canberra. Again I am encouraging staff to work out ways of using the &quot;popular Internet&quot; such as WMF projects, Blogger and Wordpress, Youtube and Internet Archive, Twitter and Facebook.. for educational benefit. My struggle is always with smaller, often in-house projects which ultimately divert students and educators away from contributing in these spaces however, as well as the obvious challenges of getting formal education and academic people, AND WMF people, to accept and support each other...

:Hope that answers your question, and thanks for your support Adrignola. From an educator/academic continuously learning [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:35, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

::That is a longer response than I would have wanted to ask of you.  I appreciate your in-depth response.  I find people's opinions of and analysis of Wikimedia informative and look for ways to use that feedback effectively.  Thank you. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:15, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

==Notes==
I changed the heading levels at [[PermaBlitz]] to second level.  The first level heading is the page title itself, placed on the page automatically.  I also added classifications so the book can be found by readers.  Finally, I adjusted the link for the ACT manual to make it a subpage. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:35, 11 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Calculating Probabilities */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">So far, we have identified the fact that light travels in quanta, called photons, and that these photons carry an amount of energy which is proportional to their frequency. We also know that photons aren't waves or particles in the traditional sense of either word. Instead, they are lumps of energy. They don't behave the way we would expect them to.

==Many Paths==
In fact, what photons do when they are travelling is to take every path possible. If a photon has to travel from point A to point B it will travel in a straight line ''and'' loop the loop ''and'' go via Alpha Centauri ''and'' take every other possible path. This is the photon's so-called 'quantum state'. It is spread out across all space.

However, just because a photon could end up anywhere in space does not mean that it has an equal probability of ending up in any given place. It is far more likely that a photon from a torch I am carrying will end up hitting the ground in front of me than it is that the same photon will hit me on the back of the head. But both are possible. Light can go round corners; just very rarely!

==Calculating Probabilities==
The probability of a photon ending up at any given point in space relative to another point in space can be calculated by considering a selection of the paths the photon takes to each point. The more paths considered, the greater the accuracy of the calculation. Use the following steps when doing this:

1. Define the light source.

2. Work out the frequency of the photon.

3. Define any objects which the light cannot pass through.

4. Define the first point you wish to consider.

5. Define a set of paths from the source to the point being considered, the more, the better.

6. Work out the time taken to traverse one of the paths.

7. Work out how many phasor rotations this corresponds to.

8. Draw an arrow representing the final phasor arrow.

9. Repeat steps 6-8 for each of the paths.

10. Add all the phasor arrows together, tip-to-tail.

11. Square the amplitude of this resultant phasor arrow to gain the intensity of the light at this point. It may help to imagine a square rotating around, instead of an arrow.

12. Repeat steps 4-11 for every point you wish to consider. The more points you consider, the more accurate your probability distribution will be.

13. Compare all the resultant intensities to gain a [[Statistics/Distributions|probability distribution]] which describes the probabilities of a photon arriving at one point to another. For example, if the intensity of light at one point is two times the intensity of light at another, then it is twice as likely that a photon will arrive at the first point than the second.

14. If all the points being considered were on a screen, the intensities show you the relative brightnesses of light at each of the points.

==Examples==
If we now take this method and apply it to several situations, we find that, in many cases, the results are similar to those obtained when treating light as a wave, with the exception that we can now reconcile this idea with the observable 'lumpiness' of light, and can acknowledge the fact that there is a certain probability that some light will not behave according to some wave laws.

===Travelling from A to B===
[[Image:Amplitude_contributions.png|right|300px|thumb|Adding phasor arrows to gain resultant amplitude by considering multiple paths, showing variation in paths' contribution to resultant amplitude.]]
This is the simplest example to consider. If we consider a range of paths going from point A to point B, and calculate the phasor directions at the end of the paths, we get a resultant phasor arrow which gives us some amplitude at point B. Since there are no obstructions, at any point this far away from the source, we will get the same resultant amplitude.

It is important to note that different paths contribute to the resultant amplitude by different amounts. The paths closer to the straight line between the two points are more parallel to the resultant angle, whereas the paths further away vary in direction more, and so tend to cancel each other out. The conclusion: light travelling in straight lines contributes most to the resultant amplitude.

===Young's Slits===

Here, we just need to consider two paths: one through each slit. We can then calculate two phasor arrows, add them together to gain a resultant phasor arrow, and square its amplitude to gain the intensity of the light at the point the two paths went to. When calculated, these intensities give a pattern of light and dark fringes, just as predicted by the wave theory.

[[Image:Mirror_quanta.png|left|300px|thumb|The most contribution to amplitude comes from the centre of the mirror.]]
===Reflection===
This situation is very to similar to what happens when light travels in a 'straight line'. The only difference is that we consider the paths which involve rebounding off an obstacle. The results are more or less the same, but the paths from which they were obtained are different. This means that we can assume the same conclusions about these different paths: that most of the resultant amplitude comes from the part of the mirror where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. In other words, the likelihood is that a photon will behave as if mirrors work according to wave theory.

[[Image:Refraction_quanta.png|right|300px|thumb|Refraction works because the greatest contribution to amplitude is caused by the paths with the shortest trip time.]]
===Refraction===
Different paths have different lengths, and so photons take different amounts of time to traverse them (these are known as trip times). In the diagram on the right, the photons again traverse all possible paths. However, the paths with the smallest difference between trip times have phasor arrows with the smallest difference in direction, so the paths with the smallest trip times contribute most to the resultant amplitude. This shortest path is given by Snell's law. Yet again, quantum physics provides a more accurate picture of something which has already been explained to some degree.

===Diffraction===
Diffraction occurs when the photons are blocked from taking every other path. This occurs when light passes through a gap less than 1 wavelength wide. The result is that, where the amplitudes would have roughly cancelled each other out, they do not, and so light spreads out in directions it would not normally spread out in. This explains diffraction, instead of just being able to observe and calculate what happens.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Technology supplier search engine Conjungo has been launched ==


I was recently discussing with a friend of mine the development of Conjungo on the basis that he was looking for a company to develop a new idea for a portal.

In so doing, he asked a question that I know a lot of non-IT people ask: why do the vendors or manufacturers of technology work via the channel community – surely they lose margins and don’t have the vital contact with their end users?

It’s a good point and one which many in the technology community take for granted, but there are a number of reasons for this:

It is rare that an organisation is simply looking for a single product or piece of software. Invariably people look for a solution which, for example, may comprise of software and other elements that may be required. This might include some hardware, support, training, maintenance, and installation which would be impossible for a vendor to deliver simply because many vendors will have tens of thousands of end users (or more) and the resources required to do this would make it uneconomic.
 
Channel partners tend to have expertise in particular fields of technology which could include, for example, ERP to a particular niche or industry type and as a result they know the precise business issues and have the ability to resolve them.

Channel partners tend to be part of their local business community and therefore are far closer to the potential end user than a vendor could ever be. As a result they are closer to the issues and problems that affect these smaller organisations and have a better understanding of them.

Channel partners know their customers best and as a result are not only able to provide a high level of service but also keep their customers abreast with developments which will be of value to them. In fact they act as a vital conduit for information.

Manufacturers would never have enough sales people and other resources to be able to satisfy demand, retain customers and deliver excellent service. Sure, there are a number of vendors that work directly with end users but this tends to be with major enterprises, who have tens of thousands of personnel and offices around the world, but even this model is changing.

Ultimately, the channel partners add significant value to both the end users and vendors alike. This has been recognised by most of the major manufacturers in recent years, and those that refused to do so are now recruiting new partners in order to tap in vital new markets.


Technology supplier search engine Conjungo has been launched to help ease search times for companies looking for suppliers of technologies. Conjungo is the only place online where technology vendors can list their entire channel in an easily searchable format. This helps buyers find local or specialist resellers. http://www.conjungo.com</text>

ArtsSmarts was created by the J. W. McConnell family foundation in 1998 as an initiative to offer more artistic activity to young people as means to help them better develop their creative thinking skills. In order to achieve their vision, ArtsSmarts began collaborations between artist and educators, and schools and communities across the country to integrate the arts into the daily routine of students studying core subjects such as social studies, math, and language arts. The program’s focus has continuously been to help students unveil who they are and help them find their place in the world as they cover the requirements of the curriculum. The idea of interdisciplinary education was the catalyst in achieving the connection as students began doing history through drama, applying mathematics through dance and comprehending science through music. 
This program has been working diligently hoping to diminish barriers between school and communities, education and culture, arts and community organizations, artists, teachers, I.Q.’s, disciplines, and all sorts of stereotypes. Since the birth of the program, ArtsSmarts has developed many arts-integrated programs across Canada, creating partnerships locally, regionally, provincially and nationally. 

The common thread between all the partnerships is their vigour for collaboration. Any organization that has a charitable status, is financially independent, and functions as an efficient and satisfactory board can be a candidate for a partnership. In addition to the aforementioned criterion, the organization must have a shared vision for arts-integration programs and have strong collaborative skills with the community, schools, and arts organizations. Many schools, arts organizations, ministries and provincial art councils are presently part of the ArtsSmarts team. 

To appreciate the partners and their works, ArtsSmarts participates in many events throughout the year. The association grants awards through arts councils and communities in recognition of those working within the arts to promote excellence in art-integrated education. The program host presentations at various conferences and exhibitions. They host an annual exhibition where selections of ArtsSmarts projects from around the world are showcased. Although funding is no longer available to their partners through ArtsSmarts, they offer mentorship and personal development programs for artists and educators as well.
ArtsSmarts has experienced a wide array of media coverage across the country since its inception. Multiple press releases and media clippings can be found on their website.  Their website functions as a useful resource to anyone interested in arts-integrated education. A substantial list of links to research based on their own work and research to support their initiatives are readily available on the site. Resources such as the 90-page handbook and the ArtsSmarts Story—which outlines and displays what the organization is all about in a storybook format, can also be accessed via their site.

ArtsSmarts model of engagement is based on four factors content, context, process, and product. It is believed the content should be personally and culturally relevant and important work, for which the students should have ownership or at least a significant choice over. The context that the learning occurs in should be collaborative and supportive, where risk-taking is encouraged and challenges can take place. The process is ideally supposed to be hands-on and filled with problem-based activities. As a result, the product is hoped to be original and generate a creation that can be experienced by others as meaningful.  
This program was chosen based on the vast amount of benefits it contributes to the educational system. In terms of students it has worked to show a significant increase in their marks in particular subjects. Students involved have shown to be less hesitant in there encounters with unfamiliar tasks and have become more concerned with the process rather than their success or failure at the task. They also display a greater readiness and enthusiasm to collaborate with one another, as they develop a better tolerance towards peers of diverse cultural backgrounds through the efforts of breaking barriers. Referring back to the models of engagement, since students are personally invested in their work they are excited and eager to spend their spare time and lunch hours working on their projects.   

For teachers the program allows the teacher-relationship to develop a stronger bond as they work closely with the students on a more personal basis. It also helps teachers gain knowledge and develop their individual strengths as they begin to see and educate in a different light. This allows teachers to become more enthusiastic as they can feel renewed by discovering a new meaning to teaching.
Having artists involved in the program allows students to observe first-hand what types of careers can be pursued in the arts. The artists’ current information in the field as an active member acts as a valuable source of knowledge/resources for the students. Furthermore, observing someone, in a field that is not always considered stable, assists students and teachers take new risks with their own work.   

Initiatives such as ArtsSmarts within schools and communities improve the physical appearance and atmosphere of the school. Having student art displayed and present, helps students gain more comfort in expressing themselves and speaks strongly towards an institutions support of student projects and student based initiatives. As a result of its presence, students gain more comfort in expressing themselves, and the organizations/communities move one step closer to achieving a better learning environment.

o	Visual art (ex. murals) can help ESL students to express their understanding of the material as well because no speaking is required.
o	Storytelling also enables these students to connect as this artistic strategy is an innate human function which in turn captures the attention of ESL students and engages them with the material.

•	''Students with behavior problems''

o	Creative writing (e.g. Poetry and journals) can help students to change their behavior as they are able to see their problems and end the downward cycle in their lives; healthy attitudes about the self and others can be created
o	Ex. from, “ The Language of Life Project”

Please don’t leave me.

Is that what love looks like?

Running around with knives?

Please don’t love me.

Is it always going to be like this?

Yelling

Screaming

Crying

Please don’t love me

If that’s what it’s all about.

Love me.

Love me.

Please don’t leave me. 


o	Video production can also help students at risk to overcome their struggles	
•	Ex. No Way Out – a short video on bullying produced by students of, Bishop Klein School, Saskatoon.

o	Music can also help to save those students at the brink of dropping out
•	Ex. The fictional movie, Sister Act II, and the song number, Joyful Joyful that occurs at the end of the movie

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

It is often useful, in Fortran and other languages, to specify where, and how you want something to print or be read. Fortran offers many formatting specifications which can serve these purposes. In this section we will be considering the READ and WRITE statements primarily.


== Read ==

The Read statement is a statement which reads from the specified input in the specified form, a variable. For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
PROGRAM READA
IMPLICIT NONE
INTEGER :: A
READ(*,*) A
END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;

will create an integer memory cell for A, and then it will read a value with the default formatting from the default input and store it in A. The first * in (*,*) signifies where the value should be read from. The second * specifies the format the user wants the number read with.
Let us first discuss the format strings available. In Fortran we have at our disposal many format strings with which we may specify how we want numbers, or character strings to appear on the screen.
For fixed point reals:  Fw.d; w is the total number of spaces alloted for the number, and d is the number of decimal places. The decimal place always takes up one position. For example, 

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
PROGRAM READA
IMPLICIT NONE
REAL :: A
READ(*,'(F5.2)') A
END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;

Will store, in A, a real number with 2 places before the decimal point, and 2 places after the decimal point. If we input 1.2354, the number would be rounded to 1.24

For Integers: nIw; n is the total number of integers, and w is the number of spaces for each integer. This can be useful for storing strings of digits (10I1). If the Integer does not fit in the allocated space, it will be truncated. For example, if we changed REAL to INTEGER , and F5.2 to I2 in READA above, and then we input 12345, the number 12 would be stored in A.

For Exponential Reals: Ew.d; w is the length of the number, and d is the number of decimal places in the real component. Important things to note are that: (1) the +/- takes up 1 space (2) The first zero in the real component takes up 1 space (3) The decimal point takes up 1 space (4) The E takes up 1 space (5) The the +/- in the exponent takes up 1 space (6) The exponent takes up 2 spaces. Thus, w must be greater than 7+d, or the number will not be stored properly.

Finally, for Character strings: Aw; w is the number of characters you would like

 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just like Identifying Sentence Errors questions,
the large majority of Improving
Sentences questions related to a surprisingly limited number or
grammatical issues. The main difference between
the two question types is that while the errors in Identifying Sentence
Errors
questions consist of single words or short phrases, the errors in
Improving Sentences questions generally involve the structure of the
whole sentence. So
improving Sentences questions can be little trickier and more involved.&lt;span

&lt;big&gt;WHAT ARE IMPROVING SENTENCES QUESTIONS?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Remember our &quot;spot-the-mistake&quot; strategy? We've got a
similar strategy for Improving Sentences. In addition to finding the
mistake in each sentence, you have to pick the answer choice that best
corrects it. Like we said, a little harder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here is an example:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

freed the Russian serfs &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;in
1861; the being four years&lt;/span&gt; before the Thirteenth Amendment
abolished slavery in the United States.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(A) in 1861; that being four years&lt;br&gt;
(B) in 1861 and is four years&lt;br&gt;
(C) in 1861 and this amounts to four years&lt;br&gt;
(D) in 1861, being four years&lt;br&gt;
(E) in 1861, four years&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I think that any content on the page [[Cookbook:Separating_eggs]] that does not already exist in the section on [[Cookbook:Egg#Separating_eggs|separating eggs]] on the egg page should be moved to the egg page, and then the [[Cookbook:Separating_eggs]] page deleted. I don't think there will every be enough content on separating eggs for it to warrant its own page.

Thoughts? [[User:Wikidsoup|Wikidsoup]] ([[User talk:Wikidsoup|talk]]) 21:36, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

i agree as well.

I also agree with this --[[User:Draco Advigilat|Draco Advigilat]] ([[User talk:Draco Advigilat|talk]]) 04:22, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

No, the articles should not be merged. Eggs are an ingredient, separation is a technique. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 14:40, 23 August 2008 (UTC)


== Raw egg danger ==

So, what is it? What is the point of having a warning everywhere if there's no explanation for it? [[User:203.214.115.130|203.214.115.130]] 06:17, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

: It's dumb. There doesn't need to be a warning on every page including eggs. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

:: There is an explanation if you care to read the article.  Raw eggs may contain salmonella which is present in most chickens.  However, whereas most chickens are asymptomatic carriers of the organism, humans are not as a rule (a famous exception was &quot;typhoid Annie&quot;).  It is a very pathogenic organism in humans, typhoid being one of the more pathogenic strains of this species of bacterium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ailerons''' control the Roll axis, keeping the wings level, or rolling one wing up, and one down.  Ailerons are usually on the back side of the main wing, closer to the tip.

'''Elevators''' move the nose up or down, changing the Pitch axis, also known as Attitude.  Elevators are usually part of the tail.

'''Rudder''' moves the nose right and left, changing the Yaw axis.  The rudder is usually part of the tail.

'''Flaps''' change the shape of the wing to add lift and reduce speed.  Flaps are often used during landing, and sometimes during take-off.  Flaps are usually on the back edge of the main wing, closer to the center of the plane.

'''Spoilers''' reduce lift by spoiling the shape of the wing, like air brakes.  Spoilers can be used while landing to give better traction for the tires on the runway.  Spoilers can also be used during flight to descend quickly, if necessary.  Spoilers are usually on the top of the wing.

Historically Dedekind gave the first construction of the real numbers. Like Cantor's construction, Dedekind's method constructs the real numbers from the set rational numbers. 
Dedekind's construction gives a more geometric picture of the real numbers

The idea of the construction is that every real number ''r'' should cut the number line into two subsets, the numbers less than ''r'' and the numbers greater than or equal to ''r''.  These two sets are different for every real number, and given these sets we could determine ''r''.  In fact, because each real number divides the number line, it also divides the rational numbers into two.  And if we knew these two sets of rational numbers, then we could also determine ''r''.  Hence when looking for a way to define the real numbers, we could define them as the collection of of ways to partition the rational numbers into two sets.  Today when discussing Dedekind cuts one usually only keeps track of one of these two sets.  Our definition of a cut could informally be thought of as the numbers less than ''r''.

==Definition==
We say that &lt;math&gt;\alpha\subset\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''cut'' if and only if:[[Image:Cuts.png|thumb|300px|The Dedekind Cut x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;2]]
#If &lt;math&gt;p \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number so that &lt;math&gt;q &lt; p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;q \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  So for any element of the cut, every rational number smaller than it is also an element of the cut.
#There exists a rational number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;p \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  So there's a rational number that's larger than any element in a particular cut.
# For every &lt;math&gt;p \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;r \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p &lt; r&lt;/math&gt;.  So every element of the cut has yet another element larger than it.  If that seems impossible, imagine a series of rational numbers that approximate the real number we're trying to define.  For example, the cut &lt;math&gt;x^2 &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt; contains a series of countably infinitely many rational numbers like 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, etc. each of which is larger than every previous one and a bit closer to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Construction==
We now outline how to make the set of Dedekind cuts form an ordered field that satisfies the the least upper bound axiom.  

====Order====
First we discuss how to compare the relative size of two cuts.

'''Definition''' Given two cuts &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \beta&lt;/math&gt; if they are the same subset of the rational numbers.  That is if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \subset \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \subset \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise''' Show equality defined as in the previous definition is an equivalence relation. 

'''Definition''' Given two cuts &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \beta&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \subseteq \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise''' Show the above order satisfies the order axioms and that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is totally ordered.

We now also assume the usual definitions to &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, we leave this to the reader to supply the correct definitions.

'''Exercise''' Given two cuts &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, show that if &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \beta&lt;/math&gt; then there is a rational number &lt;math&gt;p \in \beta&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;p \notin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise''' (Trichotomy) Show that with this order, every cut satisfies exactly one of the following three inequalities: &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

====Field Axioms====
Let α, β be two cuts

Define addition as &lt;math&gt;\alpha+\beta=\{p+q\mid p\in\alpha,q\in\beta\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Define negation as &lt;math&gt;-\alpha=\{r\in\mathbb{Q}\mid r&lt;-p \text{ for some }p\not\in\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt; be the cut defined by &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;={r|r&lt;0}.    

:'''Exercise''' For two cuts α, β verify that α+β, &amp;minus;α, and &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt; are cuts.  Furthermore show that the the set of cuts forms an abelian group with this definition of addition.  What is the identity element?

Defining multiplication requires a bit more care.  
We define 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\cdot\beta=\begin{cases}\{p\cdot q\mid p\in \alpha, p&gt;0, q\in\beta\}&amp;\text{if }\alpha\geq\mathbf{0};\\
\{p\cdot q\mid p\in \alpha, q\in\beta, q&gt;0\}&amp;\text{if }\alpha&lt;\mathbf{0}, \beta\geq\mathbf{0};\\
\{r\mid r&lt;p\cdot q,\text{ with } p\not\in \alpha, q\not\in\beta, \text{ and }p&lt;0\}&amp;\text{if }\alpha&lt;\mathbf{0}, \beta&lt;\mathbf{0}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;  
We comment that in the definition of multiplication we needed to be careful to choose elements that had a particular sign.  This is possible by the exercises involving the order on Dedekind cuts.

We shall define the cut &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;={r|r&lt;1}.

For a cut α&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0 we define 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{-1}=\begin{cases}\{r\mid r&lt;\frac{1}{p}, p\not\in \alpha\}&amp;\text{if }\alpha&gt;\mathbf{0};\\
\{r\mid r&lt;\frac{1}{p}, p\not\in \alpha,\text{ and }p&lt;0\}&amp;\text{if }\alpha&lt;\mathbf{0}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 

'''Exercise''' For two cuts α, β verify that α&amp;middot;β, α&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (assuming α&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0), and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; are cuts.  
Show that with these definitions the set of Dedekind cuts forms an ordered field.

====Least Upper Bound Property====
We will now show the set of Dedekind cuts satisfies the least upper bound axiom.  

Let ''A'' be a non-empty collection of cuts, and suppose that there is a cut β such that α&amp;lt;β for all α.  In other words, ''A'' is a non-empty collection of cuts that has an upper bound given by β.

Now we define a subset of the rational numbers, δ, by taking the unions of all of the subsets given by the cuts in ''A''.  That is &lt;math&gt;\delta=\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Now we wish to show that δ is a cut.  Suppose ''p''&amp;isin;δ, if follows that ''p''&amp;isin;α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for some α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A''.  Then if ''q''&amp;lt;''p'' then ''q''&amp;isin;α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and hence ''q''&amp;isin;δ. This shows the first property. Also, there is some ''r''&amp;isin;α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with ''r''&amp;gt;''p'', but then ''r''&amp;isin;δ. Hence the third property holds. To see that the second property holds, notice that δ&amp;sube;β because each α&amp;sube;β.  By the cut properties for β there is a rational number ''b'' so that ''b''&amp;gt;''p'' for all ''p''&amp;isin;β.  Therefore, ''b''&amp;gt;''p'' for all ''p''&amp;isin;δ.  Hence δ is a cut. 

Now, by definition of the order, δ is an upper bound of ''A''. If η any cut with η&amp;lt;δ, then there is a rational number ''p''&amp;isin;δ and ''p''&amp;notin;η.  But p&amp;isin;α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for some  α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A''. Hence η is not greater then α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore η is not an upperbound for ''A''.  Therefore ''δ'' is the least upper bound.  This shows that the set of Dedekind cuts satisfies the least upper bound axiom.

      <comment>/* Frequency and Kinetic Energy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Double-slit_experiment_results_Tanamura_2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Young's slits, using electrons.]]
So far, we have considered how quantum physics applies to photons, the quanta of light. In reality, every other particle is also a quantum, but you only need to know about photons and electrons.

The image on the right shows what happens when you fire electrons through a pair of slits: it arrives in lumps, but you get fringes due to superposition as well. The electrons are behaving as both waves and particles. Actually, they are behaving as quanta. The equations describing quantum behaviour in electrons are similar to those describing it in photons.

==Frequency and Kinetic Energy==

We know that, for photons:

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{E}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

In suggesting that electrons are quanta, we assume that they must have a frequency at which the phasors representing them rotate. We also know that h is a constant; it does not change. So, when adapting the above equation to apply to electrons, all we need to adapt is E. In electrons, this energy is their kinetic energy. If the electron has some form of potential energy, this must first be subtracted from the kinetic energy, as this portion of the energy does not affect frequency. So:

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{E_{kinetic} - E_{potential}}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

==De Broglie Wavelength==

If electrons exhibit some wavelike properties, they must also have a 'wavelength', known as the de Broglie wavelength, after its discoverer. This is necessary in order to work out a probability distribution for the position of an electron, as this is the distance the electron travels for each phasor arrow rotation. The de Broglie wavelength λ is given by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}&lt;/math&gt;,

where h = Planck's constant, p = [[/Momentum/|momentum]], m = mass of electron = 9.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt;kg and v = velocity of electron.

==Potential Difference and Kinetic Energy==

Potential difference is what causes electrons to move. You already know how [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Power|power]] is related to charge, voltage and time:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{QV}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

Since power is the rate at which work is done:

&lt;math&gt;W = QV\,&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the charge on an electron equals -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;, and that work done is energy, so:

&lt;math&gt;E_{kinetic} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times V&lt;/math&gt;

Energy, in the SI system of units, is measured in Joules, but, sometimes it is measured in electronvolts, or eV. 1 eV is the kinetic energy of 1 electron accelerated by 1V of potential difference. So, 1 eV = 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J.

[[Image:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|left|200px|Wave functions of an electron in different orbitals of a hydrogen atom. Brightness corresponds to the probability density function for the position of the electron.]]
==Questions==

1. An electron moves at 30,000 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is its de Broglie wavelength?

2. What is its frequency?

3. What is its kinetic energy, in eV?

4. Given that it is travelling out of an electron gun, what was the potential difference between the anode and the cathode?

5. An electron is accelerated by a potential difference of 150V. What is its frequency?

      <text xml:space="preserve">All moving objects have momentum. Momentum is the product of the velocity of an object and its mass, so:

&lt;math&gt;p = mv\,&lt;/math&gt;

Momentum is usually denoted p, and is measured in kgms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Momentum is used when considering collisions of bodies as momentum, in a closed system, is constant. Force is the rate of change of momentum, so:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\Delta p}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. What is its kinetic energy, in eV?'''

From the top half of the fraction in the previous question:

2.56 mV – that's why we use eV!

Our aim in this chapter is to formally define the very interesting exponential and logarithmic functions for all reals. Several authors approach this by defining the logarithm as an integral and the exponent as its inverse. We will, however, follow the reverse approach by constructing the exponential function of reals from that of rationals. (Unfortunately, in this chapter, the reader will have to bear with some tedious computations!)&lt;br /&gt;

We begin with construction of rational powers of arbitrary positive reals. 

==Construction of Rational Powers==

We can now use what we know about continuity to construct rational powers of positive real numbers.  We've already defined the integer powers; let's show they're continuous first.

===Continuity of x^n===

* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(c)| = |1-1| = 0 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;\forall \delta&gt;0: |x-c|&lt;\delta \implies |f(x)-f(c)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. 

* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\delta = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&lt;\delta \implies |x-c|&lt;\epsilon \implies |f(x)-f(c)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; .

* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^n &lt;/math&gt; is continuous for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  

We proceed by induction.  We have already seen that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.  Assuming &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, we use the fact that continuity is preserved under algebraic operations to see that &lt;math&gt;xf(x) = x^n&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{-n}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus {0}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and nonzero on the set in question, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x^n} = x^{-n}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous since continuity is preserved under division by a nonzero function.


We can now use the continuity of &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; together with the intermediate value theorem to construct positive nth roots.  As promised, this is much nicer than the construction of square roots in the first chapter:

===Construction of nth roots===

Given &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^n - c&lt;/math&gt;(it is clear that 0 has a unique nth root, so we do not consider this case).  &lt;math&gt;f(0) = -c &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and since &lt;math&gt;1+c &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(1+c) = (1+c)^n - c &gt; (1+c)^n - (1+c) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.   By the Intermediate Value Theorem, &lt;math&gt;\exists x \in (0,1+c): f(x) = x^n - c = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus c has a positive nth root.

To prove uniqueness, let x and y be two nth roots of c.  If &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^n &gt; y^n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  But then it would follow that &lt;math&gt;c &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.  Similarly we cannot have &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt;, so it  follows that &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition and Properties of Rational Powers===

Given &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt; to be the unique nonnegative nth root of x.  We then define all rational powers as follows:


:If &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; is in lowest terms(i.e. p and q have no common factors and &lt;math&gt;q&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), we define &lt;math&gt;x^r=(\sqrt[q]{x})^p&lt;/math&gt;.


Our definition would work just as well if &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; were not in lowest terms, as we'll see in a minute.  First we must prove some basic facts:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[m]{\sqrt[n]{x}} = \sqrt[mn]{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt[m]{\sqrt[n]{x}})^{mn} = ((\sqrt[m]{\sqrt[n]{x}})^m)^n =\sqrt[n]{x}^n = x&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[m]{\sqrt[n]{x}}&lt;/math&gt; is an mn-th root of x.  The result follows immediately from uniqueness of positive roots.


* &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{p}{q}} = \sqrt[q]{x^p} = \sqrt[q]{x}^p&lt;/math&gt;

Using what we know about integer powers we see that &lt;math&gt;(x^{\frac{1}{q}})^p) = \sqrt[q]{(\sqrt[q]{x}^p)^q)} = \sqrt[q]{(\sqrt[q]{x}^q)^p)} = \sqrt[q]{x^p}&lt;/math&gt;


As promised, our definition does not depend on the fraction representing r:

* If &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q} = \frac{m}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{p}{q}} = \sqrt[n]{x^m}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q} = \frac{m}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;m = cp&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n = cq&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x^m} = (\sqrt[c]{\sqrt[q]{x}}^c)^p = \sqrt[q]{x^p} = x^{\frac{p}{q}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we'll prove the standard algebraic facts about rational powers:

*If &lt;math&gt;r,s \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; x^rx^s = x^{r+s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x^r)^s = x^{rs}&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;x^rx^s = x^{\frac{a}{b}}x^{\frac{c}{d}} = x^{\frac{ad}{bd}}x^{\frac{bc}{bd}} = (x^{\frac{1}{bd}})^{ad}(x^{\frac{1}{bd}})^{bd} = (x^{\frac{1}{bd}})^{ad + bc} = x^{\frac{ad+bc}{bd}} = x^{(r+s)} &lt;/math&gt;


Also, &lt;math&gt;x^{rs}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= x^{\frac{a}{b}\frac{c}{d}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= x^{\frac{ac}{bd}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= (x^{ac})^{\frac{1}{bd}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;(((x^{a})^{c})^{\frac{1}{b}})^{\frac{1}{d}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= (((x^a)^{\frac{1}{b}})^c)^{\frac{1}{d}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = (x^{\frac{a}{b}})^{\frac{c}{d}}&lt;/math&gt;


*If &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{a}{b} &gt; 0  \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y &gt; x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;y^r&gt;x^r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof: If &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{1}{b}} \leq x^{\frac{1}{b}}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(y^{\frac{1}{b}})^b \leq (x^{\frac{1}{b}})^b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y \leq x&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the assumption &lt;math&gt;y &gt; x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  So &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{1}{b}} &gt; x^{\frac{1}{b}} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since a &gt; 0, &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{a}{b}} &gt; x^{\frac{a}{b}} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;y^r&gt;x^r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

===Continuity of rational powers===
Now we'll use the preceding algebraic properties to prove continuity of all rational powers:

* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{\frac{1}{n}} &lt;/math&gt; is continuous for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof: Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\delta = |c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt; |x-c|&lt;\delta \implies &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; |x^{\frac{1}{n}} - c^{\frac{1}{n}}| = \frac{|x^{\frac{1}{n}} - c^{\frac{1}{n}}||x^{\frac{n-1}{n}} + x^{\frac{n-2}{n}}c^{\frac{1}{n}} + \cdots + x^{\frac{1}{n}}c^{\frac{n-2}{n}} + c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|}{|x^{\frac{n-1}{n}} + x^{\frac{n-2}{n}}c^{\frac{1}{n}} + \cdots + x^{\frac{1}{n}}c^{\frac{n-2}{n}} + c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \frac{|x - c|}{|x^{\frac{n-1}{n}} + x^{\frac{n-2}{n}}c^{\frac{1}{n}} + \cdots + x^{\frac{1}{n}}c^{\frac{n-2}{n}} + c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \leq \frac{|x-c|}{|c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|}&lt; \frac{|c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|\epsilon}{|c^{\frac{n-1}{n}}|} = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.


The preceding argument works for &lt;math&gt;c \not= 0&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then let &lt;math&gt;\delta = \epsilon^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then:

&lt;math&gt;|x-0|&lt;\delta \implies |x|&lt;\epsilon^n \implies |x|^{\frac{1}{n}} &lt; \epsilon \implies |x^{\frac{1}{n}}-0|&lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

So, &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for all &lt;math&gt;x\geq0&lt;/math&gt;.


*&lt;math&gt;x^q&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for all &lt;math&gt;q \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: If &lt;math&gt;q = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, where a and b are integers and &lt;math&gt;b&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^q = (x^a)^{\frac{1}{b}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;x^q&lt;/math&gt; is the composition of continuous functions, and therefore is continuous itself.

==Real Powers==
We will define arbitrary real exponents as the supremum of the exponents of rational members of the &quot;Cut&quot; that corresponds to the given real number. But first, we need to establish that this operation indeed produces a unique real number.

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;a,x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;A=\{ a^q|q\in\mathbb{Q};q\leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;B=\{ a^q|q\in\mathbb{Q};q\geq x\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sup A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=\inf B&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta&lt;/math&gt;</text>

[[Image:Flag of Macedonia.svg|thumb|280px|right|the flag of Macedonia]]

==Macedonia's History==

The present country of Macedonia has been inhabited for thousands of years and the country has been part of many empires including the Roman Empire, Byzantine empire, Bulgarian empire, Serbian empire, Ottoman empire and, more recently, as a part of [[../Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].  Macedonia was '''one of the 6 republics of Yugoslavia'''.

'''Macedonia became independent from Yugoslavia on September 8th, 1991'''.  In the following years it faced disputes with Greece which also claims the Macedonia name (it's the name of a historical region which includes much of Greece as well as the Republic of Macedonia).  At present the country has agreed to be known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Macedonia has applied to join the [[../EU|European Union]] and has been a candidate country since 2005.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Yugoslavia|This country included present-day Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia.  It existed until 1992 and when the country broke up there were wars - a 10 day war in Slovenia, a big conflict in Croatia, a war lasting several years in Bosnia and fighting between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, Serbia}}

[[Image:Flag_of_Georgia.svg|thumb|250px|right|The flag of Georgia.]]
[[Image:Georgia in Europe.svg|thumb|250px|left|Map showing location of Georgia in Europe]]
'''Georgia''' is a small country located in the far east of Europe.  Its neighbours are [[../Russia|Russia]], [[../Turkey|Turkey]], [[../Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] and [[../Armenia|Armenia]].  The capital city is '''[[w:Tbilisi|Tbilisi]]''' and the currency used in Georgia is the '''Lari'''.  Georgia was part of the [[../USSR|Soviet Union]] until 1991.  It is not part of the [[../EU|European Union]].

==Georgia's History==
From the early 19th century Georgia was part of the Russian Empire. Georgia was made a part of the USSR, also known as the Soviet Union, in 1922. After Georgia gained independence from the USSR in 1991 it had a civil war which lasted for 3 years and was caused by a power struggle between different people who wanted to govern Georgia.  Soon after further violence occurred in the Georgian regions of '''Abkhazia and South Ossetia''' which had large populations of Russians who either wanted to become independent or part of Russia.  Since the 1990s both regions more-or-less govern themselves although they are not recognized as independent countries by most other countries.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Soviet Union|The Soviet Union was a communist country which included 15 modern-day countries including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine and many others}}

In 2008 there was a major war between Georgia, Russia and fighters from Abkhazia and South Ossetia ('''2008 South Ossetia war''').  Russia bombed Georgia and invaded parts of the country before pulling out shortly after.  Both regions continue to govern themselves although the Georgian government still insists that they are part of Georgia.

==Georgia's Geography==
[[Image:Prokudin-Gorskii-49.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Likani Palace from the Kura River, Borjomi, Georgia.]]
Georgia covers an area of about 69,700 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (about 26,900 sq mi). It is bounded by Russia on the north and by Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkey on the south. Rugged mountains make up about 85 percent of the total land area. The coastal area of Georgia has hot summers and cold winters while the mountain areas of Georgia have cool summers and rainy winters.

Georgia is a very mountainous country with many mountains over 4,000 metres high.  The highest mountain in the country is '''Shkhara''' at 5,068 metres.  Georgia is also home to many deep caves including '''Krubera Cave''' which is the world's deepest cave at over 2,000 metres deep.  Georgia's Black Sea coast is full of sandy beaches and popular with tourists from the region and elsewhere.

==Georgia's People==
The population of Georgia is 4,646,003. Nearly 100 different ethnic groups make up Georgia's population. Georgians are the largest group, making up about 70 percent of the population, followed by Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. [[Wikijunior:Languages/Georgian|Georgian]] has been the country's official language since 1918. [[Wikijunior:Languages/Russian|Russian]] is also a commonly spoken language. Education is free and required from the first grade to the eleventh grade. Georgia has an adult literacy rate of 99.5 percent.  The majority of people are [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christian]].

==Georgia's Sights==
[[Image:Svetitskhoveli_Cathedral,_Mtskheta,_Georgia_P._Liparteliani.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, Mtskheta, Georgia]]
Each year Georgia is becoming more and more popular for international tourists.  Ancient cathedrals and monasteries including '''Svetitskhoveli Cathedral''', the architecture of '''Tbilisi's old town''', traditional cuisine and fine wines are popular attractions for visitors.

Over 25% of Georgia's territory is designated as national park and forests cover 40% of the total area.  Around 3 million foreign visitors enter the country every year.  There are 4 [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in Georgia which are: Bagrati Cathedral, monuments in Mtskheta (including the cathedral in the picture on the left) and the Upper Svaneti ruins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In starting a website, one should understand the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide, publicly accessible series of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). It is a &quot;network of networks&quot; that consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry various information and services, such as electronic mail, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other resources of the World Wide Web (WWW).

The Internet has also become a large market for companies; some of the biggest companies today have grown by taking advantage of the efficient nature of low-cost advertising and commerce through the Internet, also known as e-commerce. It is the fastest way to spread information to a vast number of people simultaneously. The Internet has also subsequently revolutionized shopping—for example; a person can order a CD online and receive it in the mail within a couple of days, or download it directly in some cases. The Internet has also greatly facilitated personalized marketing which allows a company to market a product to a specific person or a specific group of people more so than any other advertising medium.

Good luck! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

==Polish course==
I am pleased to hear such words but I am not the author of this text. ;-) Anyway, good to know that Wikibooks is so helpful to people. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:VFD]] ==

Any user may vote on VFD. Thank you very much for participating in those discussions. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

== qr tags ==

Hi... I noticed you're doing some new page patrolling, and you might want yo have a look at {{tl|qr-em}} and {{tl|qr-dup}}. These are a bit better for small, newly-created modules. Thanks for helping out! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:41, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

== Metric units ==

Hi, when converting units, please leave the original units first and put converted units in parentheses. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

::Doing some great work on the metrification there - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:26, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
::As a ps, while you are wandering round cookery pages feel free to add &lt;nowiki&gt;||{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to make the recipe show correctly on an alpha basis?  No worries if you don't/miss any, I'll be doing them too! - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:30, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

G'day Xania, I noticed that you added '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units|Metric Recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to a couple of pages I'm watching. Please note that this incorrectly orders them all under &quot;M&quot; in the category. Instead, to correctly order these pages, please use the following: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes with metric units|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 22:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

== Quarts, etc. ==

A quart is two pints, or 4 cups.
A pint is 2 cups.
A gallon is 4 quarts. 

Confusing, isn't it? :-). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

== Alpha cats ==

The issue here is that all recipes (without attention) will show up on the category page under C for Cookbook which is seen as a little less than helpful &lt;g&gt;.  So if you come across a category &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Pie recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for example you need to put &lt;nowiki&gt; |{{PAGENAME}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; (use copy and paste) between the &quot;s&quot; at the end and the double brackets (]]). I've just done [[Cookbook:Rhubarb Pie]] so feel free to see what it looks like in the category section - I get all my best ideas from copying others!  And the comment above is coreect about quarts - he beat me to it. Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:50, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

== Hotkeys ==

You VfD'd this one but it was not on the VfD page. Rather than fix it I've speedy'd it but feel free to change it if you want to - don't see at as a controversial page - all the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== Adding categories ==

Hi, on [[Cookbook:Swedish Chocolate Balls]], you [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Swedish_Chocolate_Balls&amp;curid=97975&amp;diff=628354&amp;oldid=626227 added a category]. You did it incorrectly, however. Unlink normal wiki links, the piped section of a category link defines an alternate ''sort key''; the text by which the article will be sorted in the category listing. So &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units|Metric Recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will sort the page under &quot;M&quot; from &quot;Metric Recipes&quot;. You should instead just do &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you must. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:52, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:In fact, the first recommendation is bad too, Kellen, as it will file everything under &quot;C&quot; for Cookbook. The second recommendation is the appropriate one. (Pardon me joining in, I'm still watching this page after adding a comment recently) --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 06:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

::I'm aware of that now.  The thing I'm using from now on is &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I'll change any that are showing in the wrong area as soon as I get chance [[User:Xania|Xania]] 12:18, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

== Browsers ==

Don't suppose you like Firefox?  I'm an Opera user but FF can be made to work very like Opera and runs some very useful scripts for both editing &amp; patrolling.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:26, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== In case you miss it! ==
Take a look at this maybe [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#BOTM_and_COTM.2C_december]], I'm sure you could help tho I realise that you may be busy which is fine - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior Languages/Manx Gaelic]] ==

Meant to say before - nice work Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
:and meant to get back to you - so are you Manx or Irish?  I've not been to the Isle of Man (would like to) but the Ireland I've seen I loved --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
::I guess around folks here Manx would be fairly unknown to say the least.  As I said, not been there but my partner says she loved it when she visited as a child (she's from up north!).  Good catch on [[Ada Programming/Keywords]], I do tend to strip any web addresses off them given that speedy does mean speedy (!) but then I'm prejudiced against spammers. All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

== Welcomes ==

I know - I'm being picky but it does suggest that folk should have a few edits before they are welcomed (&amp; you are obviously less suspicious about someone who appears to be called &quot;online porn&quot; than I am &lt;g&gt;).  However - thanks a lot for the support - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:44, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
:OK a touch sensitive from todays vandal!  Firstly I was only looking at what it said on the template page.  There seem to be loads of people registering and few editing - I guess I'd wait but place this query in the staff lounge maybe (particularly as Johnny has a view - I'll probably go with the majority). I read &quot;online pawan&quot; as porn!  Me I guess.  All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:14, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

You have some &lt;g&gt; --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:40, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Thanks for pointing out this book. Although I want to develop one on Wikijunior, maybe I could reference to this.
While reading your userpage I read that you were asked to be an admin and would like to know if you could help me.
You see, Wikijunior has an acceptance queue that seldom has viewers so if you could think a policy to speed this process I would be very greatful. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
:I need advice on whether I should immediately separate the [[Wikijunior_Alphabet]] book into individual pages without the author's permission? --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 21:37, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
::This may seem to be a trivial question but as no one else seems to be active on Wikibooks, to add a page to the book Wikijunior Alphabet would I just search for Alphabet/A and then create page? --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 21:48, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
:::Thanks for the advice! --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 22:41, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
::::It was me that tagged it with speedy delete, I just used &quot;it did not pass the candidate queue&quot; for an excuse, I was just going to write it later on wikibooks. Note that I mean later as in a couple of months so there is no reason to move the book rather to delete it. Thanks for checking though. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 16:45, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
== Help ==
After searching across Wikibooks help pages I couldn't find how to make an information box at the top right-hand corner of a module similar to Ada Programming. Even after looking at the contents of the page using the edit tool I could not extract the text to implement the information box, I would be grateful if you could tell me how to create it. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 21:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
:In the top right-hand corner of the following web page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming Ada Programming] there are four significant emblems, development stages, infobox, PDF and department. I would like to know how to implement those. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 22:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

==  My RfA ==
Just wanted to say thanks for the support.  If I can help you in any way let me know.

== Spam ==

I know - but look an the actual page - it is mostly spam!  I blocked the user immediately but it seemed a bit harsh given what is on the main page? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
:Believe me there are some appalling pages here that are mostly links but with no policy and no interest in one...!  That said I tend to removed most of what I see but as the actual page had so much I felt it was kind of a double standard --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

:I was a long time opera user but FF is gradually getting to me and the script stuff does makes some jobs easier, particularly live preview.  Bot - yes/no - read within focus comments is one point - I guess it is a bot ''account'' which means on RC you can exclude it (i've run it at 10 pages per min edited so it clogs things up) also cos I'm running it on my account '''it''' has my rights which some might take issue with. And it can be run on auto in which case I guess it would be a bot --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:46, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Re: Attention ==
It seems the request page could use tidying so that it is more readable and concise. It also seems there is a lot of good information there and suggestions that it would be a shame if they are lost. It appears that there could be some way to keep this information without comprising the readability of the page. Do you have any ideas how this could be remedied without creating a lot of extra pages?--[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 21:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

I am going to keep it on one page. And I will make it elegant and readable, on one page. Let me try it, and if you don't like it, then you can revert or do it yourself.

== Jersey Cow ==

I noticed you blocked Jersey Cow. I think it may have been premature, since they haven't actually vandalized anything yet today and I don't think we're suppose to block for past issues. If I understand things right, blocking is generally meant to deal with user disruption and if a user is no longer being disruptful, than that means previous blocks may have successfully deter the user from continue to be disruptive.

I could be wrong though, so I'm not suggesting you or I should unblock them, just thought I would mension it as possibly useful information. Might perhaps be worth seeking the opinion of other people. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:I blocked Jersey Cow for vandalism to [[Wikibooks:Requested_books]] and not because of the users comments on the Vandalism in Progress page.  Please see their contribution list and tell me if I was right to block them.  It was only a small mumfum message but I thought an infinite block was right because this seemed to be the pattern in the block log for mumfum attacks.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 10:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Yes I saw user contributions and there was only two contributions, neither looked perticularly like vandalism to me. Its true that a book on mumfum isn't approperiate for Wikibooks, but I find it hard requesting such a book as being vandalism in itself when placed in the approperiate place as it was, since thats the page to do it. I don't really know whether you were right or wrong to block them, I wasn't trying to judge your action, rather just giving some input on my understanding of when to block or not. A short discussion I had yesterday, just to get an idea of where others might stand on this issue (so I understand things better myself), suggests that you did the right thing by blocking them, since they have a history of vandalism and showed themselvies to be that vandal and stopped them before they could do any real damage. My concern was with whether blocking a potenial vandal before vandalizing again is enough reason to block or if its better to wait until after they vandalized again before doing so, in order to encourage people to contribute to the community and only block to discourage being disruptive. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Arbitration ==

Please inform yourself of all the discussion here before you incorrectly label decisions and actions. Nothing, and I repeat nothing, about my decision had to do with IRC. I have stated this several times over the past few days. I have rarely if ever even used IRC. No arbitrator was here to even be ignored and many more users were hurt than you seem to think were. It's amazing several of the users Panic disrespected aren't permanently gone, even though some are now. Your disapproval of the actions taken can be applied to creating an official process for handling future arbitrations over at [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes]]. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

=== A discussion which was not held on IRC ===

You may interested in a post on my user page. I noticed Whiteknight post a note to Rob asking him to stop the arbitration [{{fullurl:User talk:Robert Horning|diff=737117&amp;oldid=735465}}] to which I replied Whiteknight should e-mail Rob [{{fullurl:User talk:Whiteknight|diff=737124&amp;oldid=737107}}]. He responded on my talk page that he was very agitated and would not for a while, but solicited my opinion, noting that he and I tend to disagree on almost every subject. [{{fullurl:User talk:Iamunknown|diff=737127&amp;oldid=736664}}]. I replied with (what I consider) three significant points: that I did not consider Rob's actions reprehensible, but a good-faith effort to solve a problem; that I would attempt to contact Rob before any action was made; and that I would ban Panic if it were my choice [{{fullurl:User talk:Iamunknown|diff=737304&amp;oldid=737127}}]. Rob was not contacted prior to the block, but you will notice that I was at least one community member who was in support of the block. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

=== Response ===

=== Re:Staff lounge post ===

Thanks for your reply to my post on the staff lounge, I didn't think anybody was going to reply to it. I think that there are a couple points that are worth some clarification/discussion. First off, the current (or recently past) arbitration was started ''despite'' several voiced objections. I know that I was strongly against the arbitration, and my comments were dismissed and ignored. I will have to look back through my records and see who else objected to it, before I make any claims on the matter. 

[[User:SBJohnny]] quit the arbitration early after voicing several complaints about the process. [[User:Robert Horning]] was absent from the discussion for over two weeks without any indication of when he would return, or what his intentions were on the matter. We could not, in good conscience, allow the process to stay open and undecided forever. 

6 months may be too long a block, but if we as a community decide to reduce the sentence within the next two weeks, Panic might be allowed to return in that timeframe. I doubt highly that Rob will tell us what his conclusion ''would have been'' had the arbitration continued (although I would certainly be interested to know). I know that my opinion on the matter was that Panic should have been unblocked and placed on some sort of &quot;probation&quot; until things cooled back down. [[User:Withinfocus]] took a more hardlined approach, which I don't necessarily disagree with. If I may ask, if you had been arbiter, what decision would you have made? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:59, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:Thank you for your reply. I agree with you on almost all points: solutions to disputes should be constructive, and everything is always reversible. I had offered panic a &quot;deal&quot; that he not be punished except for some kind of probationary period like the one you described. He did refuse the offer (although I doubt he was considering this alternative), and when the arbitration ended, this happened instead. I would  be in favor of a reduction of sentence from a 6 month ban to a 1 month probationary period (or longer, as needed). We would need some kind of concrete guidelines to follow, however, as panic still does not accept any wrong doing on his part. It is difficult to ask a person to &quot;be more nice&quot;, when they think they are being perfectly nice already. I think it is likely that other people would agree to this plan.
:Considering my involvement in the issue, my motives would be suspect if I proposed this plan. If you would like to start the discussion on it, however, you will have my support. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

==Post-arbitration-decision &quot;coaching&quot;==
Considering all the troubles that have come out of the final decision about Panic, I've decided to get involved again to see if there's a way of re-integrating him into the community. My approach will be to engage in calm dialog with him, as a &quot;coach&quot;. You can see the beginning of this [[User_talk:Panic2k4#Trying_to_explain|here]]. My intent is to get to a point where he makes it clear that he (1) understands the problem, (2) will try to avoid the problem in the future, (3) will make a commitment to not getting into trouble again, and (4) will understand that we will prevent him from causing further problems. I've made a more formal proposal of this [[User_talk:Withinfocus#A_suggestion|on Matt's talk page]], since he is ''de facto'' the current arbitrator, and therefore the person in charge.

I must ask you to stay out of this for now (''especially'' during the first step), unless you feel that I'm being horribly unfair. Panic needs to focus on this first point, and having more than one person to talk to will (in my opinion) just spur him into playing us off one another. He needs to look at his own behavior in an objective way, and I'm going to do my best to help him in that task. 

I should point out now that while step 4 might seem harsh and threatening, it's meant to be the opposite. If further blocks are performed, I'd like these to be &quot;time outs&quot;, rather than punitive measures... little breaks where he is given time to rethink and explain. I know this guy a bit now, and I know he likes to see how far he can push any envelope. The point is to allow no games. I strongly suggest that his block be considered indefinite until he agrees to get along, and that he should not be threatened with an ''infinite'' block unless he ''really'' games this system.

This might be a wasted effort, but it's worth a shot. I'm asking for your support. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== Unblocking Panic ==

Thank you for '''being bold''' and changing the block time frame for Panic.  At this point I don't see the need (as I was going to, BTW) try to involve the WMF board of trustees in this matter.  I felt that the six month user block was very excessive, and considering that Whiteknight on my user talk page (but contradicted on your user talk page) was threating to wheel war with me and potentially block my account if I tried to reduce this or remove the block.

What I would still like to do, essentially, is vacate the &quot;arbitration decision&quot; and try to come up with a much more realistic set of &quot;probationary&quot; restrictions on Panic.  Perhaps suggesting that he stay away from the C++ Programming Wikibook (apparently the primary source of objections here) for a set period of time, but even that is not strictly necessary.

Based on comments Panic has made in some places (such as [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Archive 29#Discussion on consensus]]) he is still learning a bit on how to work with Wikimedia projects and is merely a bit abraisive, and needs to be educated a little bit about netiquitte.  I'll say more on the Staff Lounge about this issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:18, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

I find your action '''extremely''' unwarranted and offensive. Choosing two weeks says that Panic should be punished due to his original offenses, something that has expanded to be something far greater than when that two-week period was originally chosen. I originally planned on setting his block to indefinite so a choice could be made on how to handle this and then warning you since this is definitely not a '''be bold''' issue. Rob should know that block wars are not something to be bold about. What you did, reverting a block without even gaining any sort of consensus on it, can be an extremely dangerous operation. Even though you might think otherwise, I still took the input of many people in making my decision. Your personal feelings should not change a block because you are given the right to block from the community, not yourself. Six months was in essence meant to be an &quot;indefinite&quot; period so that people could calm down and move on for a while but now there's no point to blocking at all since this action of yours has been established. It would take longer than two weeks to even get a solution made up on how to handle this, so your block is essentially just inconveniencing Panic. It's either indefinite or nothing, and so I made it nothing. He's unblocked now and so I'm sure we'll all get lots more messages on our talk pages from him and others, but I don't want to be involved with this issue any longer. I was fine until this, but your action has made all my discussion up until now without utility. The rest of you can figure out a solution to this because now my actions have been undone and now I'm done. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:51, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

I understand this.  I just can't understand why a 6 month block was given.  Are we saying that if someone takes a dispute to arbitration and loses then their punishment should be increased?  If so then I disagree.  I'm not trying to start a block war.  If someone else wishes to override me and reblock him for 6 months then they can - I will not perform that action again.  I think everyone has let their personal feelings get too involved in this situation.  The issue with Panic concerns a conflict of opinion over a Wikibook book and excessive bans (in my opinion) should never be used for users unless they are extreme vandal accounts - I'm sure we all agree that Panic is not a vandal even if we don't like his decisions.  You are very welcome to suggest my deselection as admin or to revert my actions but I still feel that this 'solution' is in keeping with what the 'crime' deserves and the views of most people.  I am replying on my talk page so that this discussion can be kept together.

:The arbitration turned into much more than the discussion of a two-week block due to Panic's accusations of great abuse of Johnny's admin powers and several others' edits in the disputed areas. Panic built up the idea that he did nothing wrong and made himself to look like an incredibly uncivil and nasty person to work with. Therefore, I felt an extended period beyond two weeks would be useful and a long enough period that people could sufficiently forget the past disagreement and be better editors over time. Johnny's (if modified) approach of indefinite suspension until Panic admits to the problems he has is a more friendly approach yet much more work. His decision to work on it is his issue. You shouldn't have overridden a block but I don't think that makes you de-sysoppable since you are not being truly malicious (even if I strongly disagree with your actions). I, Whiteknight, and others are moving on and leaving this to Johnny. Let's work on dispute resolution and not this specific case. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

==Arbitration Committees==

I am puzzled, you opposed a standing arbitration committee by saying admins could come together on an ad hoc basis then you opposed the ad hoc committee.  Are you sure you meant &quot;no&quot; to the ad hoc committee?  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:20, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

:I just wanted to put in a quick note here in response to your post on [[User talk:RobinH]]. I think that this Panic issue has dragged on far long enough, and further attempts to stir the pot are unnecessary. SBJohnny wants to find a way to &quot;reform&quot; panic, or with better terminology to &quot;help guide&quot; panic, then that's fine. Going back to the drawing board and starting a new arbitration, or restarting the old arbitration (especially considering that we still dont have a policy on the matter) is just a waste of time, and unfair harassment of Panic. Johnny had enough support to try his plan out, and i think the rest of us all need to just step back from the situation and prevent another firestorm. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Dude!!! ==

Xania, if you have something negative to say about something, please try to look into the background a bit. I agree with what you're saying &quot;on principle&quot;, but I'm getting the distinct impression that you're saying what you're saying ''exclusively'' &quot;on principle&quot;, rather than on the assumption of good faith or an understanding of the situation. 

I mean no harm to Panic, and while I doubt the feeling is mutual I consider him a friend and would miss him if he were permanently gone. The only alternative offered so far is a Wikipedia-style &quot;community ban&quot;, and I really don't want to go there because I know what the result would be. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:36, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Panic ==

My suggestion to you would be to stop participating in the large argument now developing at the Staff Lounge. Your past actions regarding Panic has made you incredibly biased on the matter. I too will be staying out of the discussion (subtracting my one comment on the matter) and did not show either my support or opposition to Johnny's proposal. Your recent remarks have been incredibly uninformed (and furthermore I believe most all of your discussion on the issue has been quite incorrect) and spreading such things need to stop. Your blocking actions on Panic without '''any''' prior discussion should alone be more than enough to persuade you to cease commenting. Although I have utmost confidence in my actions and do not want to currently personally pursue investigations into your block, further escalating this and now getting into a blocking war with another user here will likely bring about serious problems with your adminship rights. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:I'm not asking him to take the blame (much less apologize), only to accept his part in the trouble. He can't really promise not to do this later if he refuses to see why people have interepreted his actions and words as they do, if you see what I mean. The 4 conflicts that I know of are related to editorial control... in one case he made a fork because he could not cooperate with the other authors, since then it's been &quot;defending&quot; the book from changes made by others. 
:The block doesn't make us look half as silly as tolerating that sort of nonsense does. He just needs to agree to work with others, or at least allow others to work.
:BTW the &quot;silly&quot; thing was saying I'm the only person he's had conflicts with. I'm not, and in fact I'm only involved because the trouble was brought to my attention by another third party. He also knows quite well that the GFDL issue about the author's page was only a minor part of his disputes with other users.

== [[User:Panic2k4]] sockpuppet block/Comment regarding Sockpuppets on Wikibooks English ==

I do not know the nature of the dispute and decided to provide my outside opinion. It is intended to be my opinions/advice in the matter. Nothing more.

From what I understand, [[User:Panic2k4]] was blocked and his/her sockpuppets continue to edit during the duration of his/her block. There has been checkuser evidence and confessions to back this sockpuppet allegation. However because of the absence of a policy on wikibooks some people feel the block of sockpuppets is unwaranted.

I am a commons admin, and we too do not have a policy on sockpuppets on commons. However aggressive sockpuppets are blocked on commons left right regardless of the absence of a policy to do so. There is no point in having a checkuser on wikibooks if such sockpuppets are not to be blocked.

The issue with Panic isn't really about his sockpuppets and he has made it very clear that they were created by him.

== Coming to my defense ==

I have appreciated your efforts to come to a civil discussion here on Wikibooks, even if there were some arrows that have been pointed to your back as well.  I am very disappointed with the tone that this project has reached as of the last couple of months, with assumptions of bad faith and other disruptive behavior.

I also feel that some individuals on this project have openly tried to kick me off, and you know what?  They have been successful.  I may come back and help out, but not until some of the current hot heads are brought under control.  This may include Panic, but it will also include those who are seemingly antagonizing him as well.

I have tried to mend fences and to try to come to an understanding with several individuals, but nearly everything I say now, even if as innocent as &quot;the sky is blue and the grass is green&quot; is now subjected to review and contempt.  Mainly because I'm perceived as somebody opposing their viewpoint.  If you need somebody to back you up morally for your efforts here on Wikibooks, I certainly can do that.  I would hope that Wikibooks can succeed, and I hope it will someday.  I also have patience to stay low for awhile and not try to get involved with the current politcal manuverings of a certain block of users any more, even if I strongly disagree with their actions.

Perhaps it is time I concentrate on content development anyway and let the rest of Wikibooks go to heck and gone.  If you could encourage SB_Johnny to delete [[User:SBJohnny/sandbox|pages like this]] that I find not only offensive but downright antagonistic, it would be appreciated.  I know you are reading this Johnny, and you are welcome to voice your opinion here as well if you care.  I just don't care to talk to you directly any more if this is indeed your attitude toward me.

Healthy dialog can and should take place, but far too many people are accused of being a troll when that is hardly the case.  And a distinct lack of patience is also quite clear, including those who would delete things like [[Wikiversity]] and some of the stubs on this project.  I know personality conflicts do come up, and often it is better to disengage rather than to push the fight up to another level.  Life is too short to really make that many enemies.

I'm also going to be very busy over the next couple of weeks anyway as I'm on a new sales campaign for a start-up business I'm doing.  It will be very exciting if it succeeds, and no, it has nothing to do with Wikibooks or book publishing.  I hope that I can use some of the contacts from this business to help put together something really cool that will have a long term benefit to Wikibooks as well, but that is more than a year away or more.  I know this is nebulous, but I want you to know that I still care for this project and will try in my own way to see that it can succeed.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:13, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

== Actually.... ==

I really ''do'' think the &quot;user conduct RFC&quot; process could be good for our project, because a lot gets said behind the backs of others, when it would really be more constructive if it were said openly. I'd actually like it if the RFC template was designed in a way so that someone could open one for themselves if they were feeling unsure about their contributions... I personally would appreciate some constructive criticism, because I often doubt myself! --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:42, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

== WIW vote ==

I was wondering if you would be willing to revisit and hopefully even reconsider your vote for the new WIW proposal. I dont think anybody is hiding behind the excuse that &quot;we were told to remove the videogame guides&quot; anymore. I think the sad fact is that even when they were accepted here the videogame guides were a fringe element, acceptable mostly because of ambiguity in policy. Wikibooks was never the &quot;perfect place&quot; to keep these guides, and many authors felt stress because of that. We did have a bookshelf devoted to them, but there were many authors here who felt they did not belong and the environment was at least a little hostile. 

Compared to wikibooks not being the perfect place, I would argue that strategywiki ''is perfect'' for these guides. Even though our project might benefit from the inclusion of encyclopedia articles or course materials, we regularly transwiki those to wikipedia and wikiversity, respectively. It's not that we don't want them so much as it is that there are better places for them. A videogame strategy guide here has less chance to succeed, and will attract a smaller audience then a guide posted at strategy wiki. Inclusion of any additional types of materials would likely have some effect on our membership, but history has shown that comparatively few people left wikibooks when the majority of videogame guides left wikibooks for strategy wiki. The result of this is that several previous wikibookians are members at strategy wiki, and a few of them still work to manage transwikis from here to there.

I don't want to ignore the videogame issue entirely, but considering the history i really feel like it's a ship that has already sailed. I think it would be a big shame to prevent forward progress on this project because of a situation that is basically already over. Even if we do decide to allow videogame guides at this point, you really have to ask yourself how many guides will be created here, and how many will stay here when they learn about better places such as strategywiki. I think that the number would be very small. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:04, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, and I certainly don't want to be accusing of trying to manipulate people. The atmosphere around here is certainly ripe for such accusations, I think.

If you don't want to change your vote that's completely fine, but I am really glad to hear that you will reconsider. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:37, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:: Just a quick comment, I may be incorrect, but since the strategy wiki is under the GFDL, wouldn't basically anyone be able to take that content and use it\redistribute it for non-commercial purposes if the desire arose? (assuming that proper attribution is given and all that)[This is in response to your statement on WK's page]. Of course I'm not exactly keen on their image use policy (or lack thereof) but the same issues would occur here with the images, and even more so now that the new statement has been released by WMF regarding fair use [I am of the opinion that such a use would not qualify under their statement]. I'd say let them deal with that stuff :). Of course, I understand the reasoning behind the arguments that VG guides should be on here as well, and I respect the viewpoint, I just agree with WK that things'll be better off if we let them go where there'll be no argument.

I'm not sure what more can be done to make people aware of discussions thats going on. It seems like another admin's idea of listing the vote on the watchlist may have worked some. Things can be announced, but if nobody is looking, knows where to look, can't find it entwined with other discussions going on, etc. not sure what else could be done to encourage more community involvement in building a consensus. I have no idea if its just an disorganization issue, if people are just procrastinating, or if most people simply aren't interested in such things.

I recently created a vote template, along with a new category, for proposed policies and guidelines to try to introduce another means of organizing policies and guidelines a little more, since Robert brought up how Wikibooks use to using voting pages and how much more organized things use to be when they were used. However there still seems to be some work that needs done to try to make it easier for people to know whats being discussed or not needs to be discussed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:42, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

:The WIW vote is mentioned on the bulletin board as well, and it has come up on the staff lounge several times over the last several months of development. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:51, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Goats ==

Believe it or not, Johnny owns a goat. In fact i would suspect his account had been hacked if he ''didn't write a book about them''. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:04, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

Heh, yeah, I'm writing about goats. I have one milking goat now, getting 3 more over the next few weeks. more &quot;fodder&quot; for [[v:School:Agriculture]] :P.

== What is Wikijunior ==

[[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]]&quot; is proposed as a policy and has been included on the [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines/Vote|Wikibooks Policies and Guidelines Voting]] page. Please take time to comment and express your opinion in the referendum.

==Original research==

I noticed that you felt that the [[Consciousness studies]] book was original research. There is no doubt that the book occupies a new niche in the literature on consciousness because it attempts to bridge the gap between philosophy and neuroscience.  The most difficult theoretical problem confronting the neurophysiologist is how we acquire a unified view, how do two eyes with different images in each and two ears with data that does not naturally overlie the world give rise to our experience. This physiological problem is well known and has been called the &quot;binding problem&quot;, the problem of &quot;rivalries&quot; and, most recently and usefully, the problem of &quot;phenomenal consciousness&quot;. There are some philosophers who believe that phenomenal consciousness does not exist, as there are some scientists who do not believe that global warming is man-made, but this would not be a reason for banning the book as original research.

Is the book original research? &quot;Original research refers to unproven facts and to theories that have not been subject to peer review.&quot; ([[Wikibooks:Original research]]). At the detailed level the various arguments are reported as a succession of sections and every section is heavily supported by references and a profusion of direct quotations from other work that present both sides of the various arguments.  Is that original research? This leaves the overall question of whether a book on a niche that has not been covered before is &quot;original research&quot;.  It is obviously original, I know of no other book that collects together the literature on phenomenal consciousness. 

The charge of &quot;original research&quot; is probably the most serious charge that can be raised against a Wikibook and should really be defended or withdrawn.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:18, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

== The &quot;vote&quot; ==

My post on the staff lounge is definately not a &quot;vote&quot;. I'm asking what people's opinions are, and I am also asking for people to describe their opinions. A vote has an outcome, this does not. There will be no result, other then being able to say that there is consensus one way or the other. If you read the decision making policy, matters on wikibooks shouldnt be decided by votes anyway. What I'm trying on the staff lounge is a two-pronged attack: we use the fancy templates to give a &quot;my opinion in a nutshell&quot; so we have a nice graphical measure of the communitie's opinions, and we have a section below that for comments where people can explain themselves. In reality, the explanations the most important part of the whole process. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 20:45, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

== Close What is Wikijunior discussion. ==

I believe that consensus has been reached. I do not want to close it myself since I proposed it. Can you review and see if you feel it's appropriate to close? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:28, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

== Re-sorting English wikibooks ==

Thanks for your input on the languages bookshelf there, Xania. A couple of us (too few) are still hammering out details regarding how best to reorganise the bookshelf and its associated template (see the [[Wikibooks talk:Languages bookshelf|talk page]] if your haven't already), and anything you'd like to contribute to the discussion would be welcome. To synthesise, the main idea, which we've decided to implement, is to scrap organisation by language families and order the languages by continents; that's been done for the main list, as you've seen, and similar changes to the template have been requested. Having settled that, the main issue now is what to do about languages with several wikibooks, as in the case of English, notably. What you have done there fits in well with our plans, which are to set up language-specific pages or templates in such cases. The technical details escape me a bit and we're still deciding how to do it, but the end result will be a listing of English books and the incorporation of that list into the languages bookshelf list rather than simply listing each book separately as was the case until now. Your thoughts welcome if you have any to share. Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:59, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Protists, because they have the most diversity between species.

2. 

a) Be careful. This question cannot be answered, as the genus of the species is not given.

b) Cannot be answered.

3.

a) ''Chondrus crispus'' 

b) ''C. crispus''

4. b), this is because DNA is the most quantitative way to determine relatedness. 

5. g)

6. d)

7. This is to ensure accuracy. Since mitochondria is passed directly from a mother to her offspring in each generation, there would be less chance of a mutation or an error. The mitochondria is not replicated in mitosis.

Ok everyone this is what I found on a website. (Someone said this).

Just FYI everyone:
DCook is VERY LOW on BLEEP so if you could spare an extra few minutes of voting, this week is the week to do it. He was second to last on BLEEP but just passed Syesha to make him third last. 

We need to help him work his way up⿦ I thought the judges were really harsh with him (besides Paula, bless her little heart)- and unfortunately that⿿s what most of America votes based on.
SAVE DAVID COOK TONIGHT!

VOTE FOR DAVID COOK!

Prmarten - I agree - David Cook is the rocker that finally needs to win this competition. The David A - is such a wannabe - he needs to talk to the Disney people.

David may have used up his 1 bad performance this last week. I'm a huge fan of his but last week was the worst of all the contestants. I hope this week he makes a monster rebound, or we might be floored again come the next results show. I mean who would of thought Micheal Johns was out. Not me. I am so sick of the 17 year old Micheal Boltan wannabe he has to go!!!!!

A word to the BLEEPers...careful, if you really are David Cook fans. You can bet Archie fans are NOT going to BLEEP this week, and will be voting in droves. Yes, the way Michael was cut sucks, but the show will go on, and your favorites need your votes.

Nattifan -- you so get it 

Of course the &quot;give back&quot; was not a stunt. For those who GET IT, DC does not want the pity vote with a cheesy explanation of why he chose to sing Innocent -- he just kept it simple that it spoke to him and left it at that.

The subtleties of his actions are so clear to me....it must be so difficult for him to hold it all inside, all his feelings and pain, the heaven and hell he's living in right now -- his brother, the press (I hope he doesn't listen to it), the schedule pressures...

A '''sequence''' is a set of numbers in a given order:
½ ⅓ ⅔ ¼

Arithmetic sequences: &lt;math&gt; a_n = an + b &lt;/math&gt;

Geometric sequences: &lt;math&gt; a_n = a r^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Oscillating sequences: &lt;math&gt; a_n = (-1)^n &lt;/math&gt;

Periodic sequences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Download ===
The code is currently downloadable only from forum [[http://www.kdenlive.org/bbforum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=516]]. Simply copy code via clipboard to a new file and save it under suggested name kdenlive_builder.sh.

=== Usage ===
==== First run ====
Check DEST_DIR settings in the code. It is set to ~/build/kdenlive_0_6svn by default, change it if you prefer a different target directory.

 ./kdenlive_builder getsources
 ./kdenlive_builder build

If the build was successful simply run kdenlive from ~/build/kdenlive_0_6svn/bin directory.

You don't need a root privileges at any part of the process.

==== Next runs ====
 ./kdenlive_builder updatesources
 ./kdenlive_builder clean
 ./kdenlive_builder build
  
==== Full help ====
 kdenlive_builder getsources - call svn to get sources for all subprojects for the first time
 kdenlive_builder updatesources - call svn to update sources for all subprojects
 kdenlive_builder clean - clean subdirs. Recommended to call prior to build
 kdenlive_builder build - build and instal all sources to user defined directory
 kdenlive_builder info  - print revision numbers and dates for each component

=== Why classic version? ===
This is branch of kdenlive_builder script the original one; classic if you want. No GUI, not interactive, just a hardcore CLI script. Use classic version if:
* the GUI version does not work for you
* you prefer a true batch process
* you want call script repeatively
* you are not afraid of touching the bash script code

The GUI version is generally preferred over the classic version, it is more user friendly, nicer, interactive. The GUI version is suggested especially for less experienced hackers or newcomers.

=== Maintainers ===
This branch is (semi)maintained by Espinosa (me) and it i released mostly on &quot;works-for-me&quot; basis. The GUI variant of kdenlive_builder script is maintained by another community members. This script is not maintained by any of core Kdenlive developers this is generally a wider community effort.  

=== Technical details ===
Classic keeps LD_RUN_PATH approach to 'link' SVN ffmpeg and mlt libraries to kdenlive, to keep potentially several versions of ffmpeg and mlt in one system in very general and safe way. However there were reports in the forum which may indicate that this approach is not accessible (blocked?) in some Linux distributions.

The benefit of this approach is you don't need any LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting or any wrapper script, just simply run the kdenlive binary from the target directory!

=== Releases ===
The latest version is 3.1 released 12.4.2008
Changelog:

* adapt script to several changes in kdenlive, ffmpeg and mlt builds; particulary:
* adapt to ffmpeg headers structure, add ffmpeg_headers_hack1, ffmpeg_headers_hack2
* set PKG_CONFIG_PATH (needed to build MLT libavformat module)
* changes in LD_RUN_PATH (really needed?)
* ffmpeg configure options names changes, namely: disable-stripping, enable-postproc, enable-swscale

      <comment>moved [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Suicide]] to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Suicide]]: Per [[Wikibooks_talk:Votes_for_deletion#Page_rename_proposal]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Suicide]] ==
{{closed|1=Closed as '''keep''' per consensus. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:49, 9 April 2008 (UTC)}}
I have nominated this book for a vote.  The book is only 2 days old.  It was tagged for speedy deletion by [[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] but [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] (the original author) has queried the deletion on the talk page. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:52, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I can see why this book makes many people feel uncomfortable, but I don't see it as a NPOV violation, any more than a book teaching people how to program in C++ advocates the use of it. Of course, as the creator of that book, I could be seen as biased towards keeping it... [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 01:50, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} I'd like to see what this book becomes.  If it's a how-to guide for committing suicide, I think it should definitely go.  But if it becomes an information source for those considering suicide, it could be a lifesaving resource. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:56, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
**{{comment}} What's wrong about telling people how they can commit suicide? Or a more relevant question, what rule on Wikibooks says that this kind of book is not allowed? [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 02:01, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
***First of all, Wikibooks ''is'' censored by community consensus, so if we decide it goes, it goes. However, I don't see any ''necessary'' conflict between Wikibooks' mission and a text on suicide, ''even if it instructs how to do so''. Such a text would be valuable (for example) to doctors in [[w:The Netherlands|The Netherlands]], where [[w:assisted suicide|assisted suicide]] is [[w:Euthanasia in the Netherlands|legal]]. However, I'd want to see a very clear scope and outline laid out before I'd vote to keep this text. Perhaps Hoogli would do so now, so we can discuss their plans for this book sensibly instead of on the basis of what each of us imagines their plans to be. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:11, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
***{{comment}} I am under the impression that the vast majority of people who take their own lives are mentally ill when they do so.  Providing such how-to information to the mentally ill strikes me as a violation of their human rights.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:22, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. What would be POV is if some of us deleted this userbook because of our beliefs about suicide. Keeping this book is the NPOV course. It meets the definition of a textbook, so the textbook status of [[Suicide]] is not an issue. [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 05:51, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
*I'm not ready to make a decision, and I'm not sure it would be wise to keep or delete this book, until more content is added so that the nature of the content in this book on such a sensitive topic is written. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:52, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} As of yet i'm not sure what to make of this book. I would like to request that the VFD be put on hold, or at least kept open, until the book's scope has been clarified. However if it becomes clear that the book is a how-to guide for commiting suicide, or anything of the sort, I would be ''very'' uncomfortable with it remaining on wikibooks. However I will reserve judgement until a proper outline has been written. [[User:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:21, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
**I agree here. If the book is providing instruction in suicide, I would be uneasy about its remaining here. If it discusses the length and breadth of the topic, then that's another story. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:21, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} It's too early to make a decision about a book which is only a few days old. If the book later included instructions on how to commit suicide then I'd wanted it deleted because it would be impossible to maintain a NPOV rather than for moral reasons. Anyway suicide is legal in most countries (no idea about the USA) but assisted-suicide is illegal. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:31, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: seive → sieve using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Prime Sieve (parallel with linda type coordination)===

Linda is a way to coordinate the actions of multiple
processors. A tuplespace is created for the candidate
primes to live. The sieve processes are created and send
messages to the tuplespace to remove non-primes. The 
sieve processes also send messages to each others to
remove the non-prime sieves. 

How many processors can this program use?
This program creates as many sieves as the square root 
of the numbers in the matrix (tuplespace).  
If we are looking for the primes below
100 then there are about 10 parallel sieve processes.
Actually, most of the sieve processes are halted and only 
(the number of prime numbers under the square root of Max) 
processes are left at the end. This allows an easy parallelism 
of 10 for 100 and 100 for 10000 with little modification.

In Erlang, it is not recommended that one use a huge number of 
atoms, so N should not get too large. We also might run out of 
processes or memory. 

This program breaks one of the general rules of Erlang process
management: do not use peer managers. Each of the sieve processes
is a peer manager because each sieve may halt any other sieve. 
Rather, processes should be managed in a top-down tree stucture.
The peer management of the sieves causes some nasty timing 
issues. Timing is one reason why peers are usually a bad idea.

When the sieve for 2 ends, the list of primes is dumped. Erlang
should give each process equal CPU time. When the slices are 
even, the sieve for 2 starts first and ends last. When some other 
sieve is starved for time, it may end after sieve 2
and the prime number dump will be too early, leaving some 
numbers divisible by 2 in the list of putative primes. 
Relative starvation of some process happens about 1 out of 
10 times. Clearly the critical word should be: &quot;tries&quot;. 
&quot;Erlang TRIES to give each process equal time slices.&quot;

Does it hurt to have non-prime sieves running? We can use a 6-sieve.
A 6-sieve is redundant because the 2-sieve and the 3-sieve remove
all numbers that the 6-sieve would remove. By removing the 6-sieve
and its non-prime sieve brothers
we reduce the number of messages that the matrix must handle
thereby speeding the final result.

&lt;big&gt;'''Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers'''&lt;/big&gt;


*This page is for non-melanoma skin cancers. 
**For randomized information, see [[Radiation_Oncology/Skin/Randomized|Randomized trials]]
**For melanoma, see [[Radiation Oncology/Melanoma]].

==Epidemiology==
*US incidence is estimated at 3.5 million lesions in 2.2 million patients


*'''Multi-Institutional; 2010''' (1996-2006) PMID 20231499 -- &quot;Incidence estimate of nonmelanoma skin cancer in the United States, 2006.&quot; (Rogers HW, Arch Dermatol. 2010 Mar;146(3):283-7.)
**Claims analysis. Multiiple US government data sets
**Outcome: Medicare fee-for-service procedures 2.05 million in 2006 Age-adjusted procedure rate 6,075/100,000. Increase by 16% from 2002 to 2006. Total number of non-melanoma skin cancers estimated 3.5 million lesions in 2.2 million patients
**Conclusion: Much higher overall totals of skin cancer diagnoses than previous estimates

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;

''Primary Tumor:''
*Tis - in situ
*T1 - 2 cm or less in greatest dimension with fewer than 2 high risk features
*T2 - &gt;2 cm; or tumor any size with 2 or more high risk features
*T3 - invasion of maxilla, orbit, or temporal bone
*T4 - invasion of skeleton or perineural invasion of skull base

:''High risk features:''

''Note:'' this staging system included Merkel cell carcinomas (was changed beginning with the 7th edition)

''Primary Tumor:''
*Tis - in situ
*T1 - 2 cm or less in greatest dimension
*T2 - &gt;2 cm and &lt;= 5 cm
*T3 - more than 5 cm in greatest dimensino
*T4 - invades deep extradermal structures (i.e. cartilage, muscle, bone)

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - yes

''Distant Metastases:''

==Surgery vs RT==
*'''Gustave Roussy''' (1982-1988) -- surgery vs RT
**Randomized. 347 patients, primary BCC of the face, &lt;4 cm, confirmed by bx. Arm 1) Surgical resection, at least 2 mm margin vs Arm 2) RT using 3 available techniquest: interstitial brachytherapy Ir-192 65-70 Gy over 5 days (55%), superficial contact RT 50 kV 36/2-40/2 over 2 weeks (33%), orthovoltage RT 8-250 kV 60 Gy in 2-4 Gy/fx 3x/week (12%). 
**'''1997''' PMID 9218740 -- &quot;Basal cell carcinoma of the face: surgery or radiotherapy? Results of a randomized study.&quot; (Avril MF, Br J Cancer. 1997;76(1):100-6.)
***Outcome: 4-year local failure surgery 0.7% vs RT 7.5% (SS), by modality interstitial BT 9% vs contact RT 7% vs orthovoltage RT 5%. 
***Toxicity: Cosmesis significantly better after surgery than RT, good result according to patients surgery 87% vs RT 69% (SS). Dyspigmentation and telangiectasia in 65%
***Conclusion: Surgery preferred to RT in smaller BCC of the face

==Cutaneous SCC==
===Prognosis===
*'''Tubingen, Germany; 2008''' (1990-2001) PMID 18617440 -- &quot;Analysis of risk factors determining prognosis of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma: a prospective study.&quot; (Brantsch KD, Lancet Oncol. 2008 Aug;9(8):713-20. Epub 2008 Jul 9.)
**Retrospective. 615 white patients, surgery. Median size 1.5cm, median thickness 3mm, desmoplasia 8%.  Median F/U 3.6 years
**Outcome: LR 3% (75% within 1st year), DM 4%. 
**Predictors: Local recurrence desmoplastic 24% vs. non-desmoplastic 1% (SS); thickness &lt;6 mm 3% vs. &gt;6 mm 12% (SS). Distant mets &lt;2 mm thick no mets; 2-6 mm thick 4% mets, &gt;6 mm thick 16% mets
**Conclusion: Tumors &gt;6 mm thick associated with high risk of local recurrence and DM; desmoplastic growth independent risk for local recurrence
**Editorial (PMID 18672208): Should change staging from size to thickness

===Lymph Node Staging===
*'''Drexel, Philadelphia; 2006''' PMID 17083582 -- &quot;Sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review of the English literature.&quot; (Ross AS, Dermatol Surg. 2006 Nov;32(11):1309-21.)
**Literature review. 607 patients with anogenital SCC and 84 patients with nonanogenital SCC analyzed. 
**Outcome: Identification rate 96-97%. False negative rate by CLND 4-5% (most of these from early studies when combination radioisotope and blue dye was not used)
**Toxicity: Rare
**Conclusion: SLNB accurately diagnoses subclinical LN mets, with few false negatives and low morbidity

==RT alone==
*'''U. Florida, 1987'''
**PMID 3597161 &amp;mdash; &quot;T2-T4 carcinoma of the skin of the head and neck treated with radical irradiation.&quot; Mendenhall WM et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1987 Jul;13(7):975-81.
**PMID 8360054 (T4 tumors)
**Poor results for tumors with bone, cartilage, or nerve invasion. Only 50% LC with XRT alone.

*'''Washington University, 2001''' (1966-97) - PMID 11697321 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy for epithelial skin cancer.&quot; Locke J et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Nov 1;51(3):748-55. 
**Retrospective. 468 pts treated with RT alone.
**Control rate for basal cell was 95% (86% if recurrent), 89% for squamous cell (68% if recurrent). For basal cell, improved control with larger fraction size (&gt;2 Gy).  No apparent dose response for SCCa.
**Guidelines: Treat at 2.5 Gy/fx, 4 days/week. Basal cell - 40 Gy (&lt; 1 cm), 45-50 (1-3), 60 Gy (&gt;3).  Squamous cell - 45-50 Gy (&lt;1 cm), 60 Gy (&gt; 1cm).

==Perineural invasion==
*Differentiate microscopic perineural invasion from clinical perineural invasion (symptoms of formication, numbness, etc.)1965-
*LN+ in 15% (Garcia-Serra et al., see below)

*'''U. Florida'''
**'''2003''' PMID 14648861 (1965-99) &amp;mdash; &quot;Carcinoma of the skin with perineural invasion.&quot; Garica-Serra A et al. Head Neck. 2003 Dec;25(12):1027-33.
***Retrospective. 135 pts treated with RT who had PNI (59 microscopic, 76 clinical). &gt;80% were squamous cell, ~20% basal cell. 15% with clinical LN+. 
***Microscopic PNI - 93% treated with RT postoperatively. 56% were recurrent, 29% with positive margins. Median RT dose 60 Gy in 32 fx. Most (88%) treated with once daily RT. 50% treated with local fields only, 50% with large fields to base of skull. Elective nodal RT in 18%.
****Results - 5-yr LC 87%, LRC 72%. Initial failure - local 14%, regional 14%, distant 3%. 19% of squamous cell carcinomas recurred in regional LNs. 
***Clinical PNI - 53% treated with post-operative RT, 45% treated with definitive RT. 69% recurrent, 55% (22 of 40 who had resection) with positive margins. Median RT dose 70 Gy in 39 fx (40% treated twice-daily). 12% treated with local fields only, ~2/3 treated with large fields to base of skull, 22% with extended fields. Elective nodal RT in 44%.
****Results - 5-yr LC 55%, LRC 50%. Initial failure - local 38%, regional 5%, distant 0%. 9% of SCC recurred in regional LNs. 
***Lower local control in those with clinical PNI. **Low rate of successful surgical salvage (12-30%). **Symptomatic improvement in neuropathy in only 7% after treatment.
***High rate of nodal failure in the microscopic PNI cohort (of whom only 18% received RT to the nodal areas) versus only 10% failure in the clinical PNI group (44% received nodal RT).
***Conclusion: Nodal RT should be considered in pts with 1) SCC with perineural invasion, 2) clinical PNI with any histology. 
**'''2012''' PMID 22185685 (1965-2007) -- &quot;Skin carcinoma of the head and neck with perineural invasion.&quot; (Balamucki CJ, Am J Otolaryngol. 2012 Jul;33(4):447-54.)
***216 pts. 
***Clinical PNI: 5-yr LC 54%, LRC 51%, FFDM 94%.
***Incidental PNI: 5-yr LC 80%, LRC 70%, FFDM 90%.


===Hypofractionation===
*France - PMID 2710943 (Abatucci et al, 1989)
**675 pts. 10.2 Gy x 3 fractions given once a week. Superficial X-ray. 96% local control. Excellent cosmetic outcome.

==RT of the Pinna==
*Approximately 5-20% of all skin cancers
*Skin is thin, SQ fat is sparse, and muscle layer is discontinous, which makes surgery challenging but also increases risk of cartilage necrosis during RT
*Tumor infiltration may be deep due to ear location within embryonic fusion planes
*Anatomical irregularities make dosimetry difficult
*Historically, with superficial and orthovoltage machines in 1950's, RT was considered contraindicated near bone/cartilage
*Recent literature using modern techniques and fractionation shows RT to be safe and effective
*Dose absorption of cartilage is comparable to other soft tissues
*Local control of squamous cell and basal cell appears comparable
*Consider lower Gy/fx (2-2.5) for large tumors, recurrences, and long life expectancy for good cosmesis; shorter schedules for elderly, debilitated patients with small tumors. 


*'''Milan, 2005''' (Italy) PMID 15941445 -- &quot;Radiotherapy of skin carcinomas of the pinna: a study of 115 lesions in 108 patients.&quot; (Caccialanza M, Int J Dermatol. 2005 Jun;44(6):513-7.)
**Retrospective. 115 cases (99 basal, 16 squamous) tumors of the pinna. Some large (18 T2, 7 T3). RT kilovoltage. Total dose 45-70 Gy, fraction size 2.5-5 Gy, given 2-3 fractions per week. Mean F/U 2.4 years
**5-year LC: 78%; relapse 8% in-field, 3% marginal. All relapses basal cell
**Cosmesis: Good/acceptable (no signs/mild atrophy or dyschromia) 88%; no long term complications observed
**&lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: High remission without damaging cartilage

*'''Princess Margaret, 2000''' (1982-1993) PMID 10802373 -- &quot;Results of radiotherapy for epithelial skin cancer of the pinna: the Princess Margaret Hospital experience, 1982-1993.&quot; (Silva JJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 May 1;47(2):451-9.)
**Retrospective. 334 lesions treated (201 basal, 122 squamous, 11 mixed). RT orthovoltage (278) or magavoltage electrons (39) prescribed to 90%/95%/100% isodose. Most common doses 35/5 (field size 5 cm2), 45/10 (field size 10.5 cm2), 50-65/20-30 (field size 81 cm2). Median F/U 3.3 years
**5-year LC: 79%; relapse in-field 14%, marginal 2%, LN 1%. Predictors for failure tumor size &gt;2cm, and low BED (&lt;54 Gy using a/b=14). 5-year CSS: 96%
**Toxicity: Grade 4 was 7.3%; Predictors tumor size (T2 worst-why?), field size (&gt;5 cm2), and fraction size (&gt;4 Gy)
**Conclusion: RT effective including megavoltage electrons, large tumor and low BED not good; fraction size &lt;4Gy better to reduce necrosis, esp in large fields. 

*'''Kingston, 1996''' (Canada)(1982-1991) PMID 8985024 -- &quot;Necrosis following radiotherapy for carcinoma of the pinna.&quot; (Hayter CR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Dec 1;36(5):1033-7.). 
**Retrospective. 138 curative treatments for (70 basal, 62 squamous, or 6 mixed) tumors of the pinna. RT orthovoltage (79) or megavoltage electrons (59). Most common dose 35/5. Total dose range 17.5-64 Gy. Median F/U 4.8 years
**5-year LC: 93%
**5-year necrosis (any skin ulceration): 13%; most healed with conservative management, only 2% required surgery
**Predictors for necrosis: daily fraction size &gt;6 Gy (16% vs. 2%), treatment time &lt;5 days (18% vs. 3%)
**Conclusion: RT for pinna effective, but protracted schedule should be used for minimal risk of necrosis

*'''Birmingham, 1993''' (UK) PMID 8305363 -- &quot;Cartilage: the 'F'-factor fallacy.&quot; (Atherton P, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1993;5(6):391-2.)

*'''Germany; 2007''' PMID 17610993 -- &quot;A phase III, randomized, open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream applied thrice weekly for 8 and 12 weeks in the treatment of low-risk nodular basal cell carcinoma.&quot; (Eigentler TK, J Am Acad Dermatol. 2007 Oct;57(4):616-21.)
**Randomized. 90/102 patients with nodular basal cell. Arm 1) imiquimod TIW x8 weeks vs. Arm 2) imiquimod TIW x12 weeks. Both followed by excsion
**Outcome: No difference between arms. Clinical clearance 78%, histological clearance 64%. Residual tumor in 17% of clinical CR
**Toxicity: minor/moderate local inflammation in 92%
**Conclusion: No difference between arms. Modest activity, due to 17% residual tumor after clinical CR, recommend excision for all

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello I'm the authour of this page. 
It was not made in error. PLasma is the replacement for kdesktop which provided the desktop paradigm in KDE3. PLasma intends to extend this desktop paradigm with things like simple scripting and widgets as well as making the users desktop scalable so that it can taken from a standard computer screnn and essentially transferred as is to a small form factor device to be carried mobile and scaled up to be managed on multiple cimputers in the case of a server farm or physically such as giving a presentation at a conference. 

There has been a push recently to consolidate the information that exists on Plasma to a developers Quick reference on the KDE official technical wiki (known as the Techbase). I took it upon myself to use this to start a user hand book at the same time which, as no one had any objections, I would keep on wikibooks as there is already a nicely done Using KDE book here. I know it is a bit sparse right now :) but let me know what is needed from the wikibooks point of view and I will get on it. I was trying to organize a skeleton Table of Contents on my part. Thanks for the prompt notice.

Interesting article, but riddled with grammatical errors and a few technical inaccuracies. Patriot's problem had nothing to do with a missile - none were launched, because the target had been lost. And in the Mars article, priority inversion protection doesn't lead to all threads having elevated priorities, because in any correctly implemented priority promotion scheme, threads which are no longer contributing to the inversion get set back down to their original priority. 

It's important to document these kinds of failures, but this needs to be tightened up.

==Uses, Limitations, and Options==
----
===Uses===
----
The control is used mainly for text, though it can hold an image.   An example of its use and the result is:

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Dialects===
Based on a large group of features, the Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern and Western groups (the boundary runs approximately from [[w:Skopje|Skopje]] and [[w:Skopska Crna Gora|Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[w:Vardar|Vardar]] and Crna). In addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the Proto-Slavonic reduced vowels (&quot;[[w:yer|yer]]s&quot;), vocalic sonorants and the back nasal (o). That classification distinguishes between the following 5 groups {{ref|Bernard_Comrie2002}}:

Western Dialects:

*'''Ohrid - Prespa Group''' consisting of the Lower Prespa region, [[w:Ohrid|Ohrid]], [[w:Struga|Struga]], Radožda and [[w:Vevčani|Vevčani]].
*'''Debar Group''' consisting of the Drimkol - Golobrdo region, [[w:Debar|Debar]], Mala Reka, Reka, [[w:Gora (region)|Gora]], and Skopska Crna Gora.   
*'''Polog Group''' consisting of [[w:Gostivar|Gostivar]] (Upper Polog), and [[w:Tetovo|Tetovo]] (Lower Polog), as well as the entire West Central region ([[w:Prilep|Prilep]], [[w:Kičevo|Kičevo]], [[w:Bitola|Bitola]], [[w:Kruševo|Kruševo]], [[w:Florina|Florina]]/Lerin)
*'''Kostur - Korča Group''' consisting of [[w:Korçë|KorçNestorioë]] (Korča), [[w:Kastoria|Kastoria]] (Kostur), and [[w:Nestorio|Nestorio]] (Nestram).

Eastern Dialects:

*'''Eastern Group''' consisting of the entire eastern part of the Macedonian region including the [[w:Kumanovo]] - [[w:Kriva Palanka]], [[w:Štip]] - [[w:Strumica]], [[w:Tikveš]] - [[w:Mariovo]], Maleševo - Pirin, Lower Vardar ([[w:Kilkis Prefecture|Kilkis]]/Kukuš, [[w:Edessa, Greece|Edessa]]/Voden-[[w:Pella Prefecture|Pella]]/Postol, [[w:Thessaloniki Prefecture|Thessaloniki]]/Solun), and the [[w:Serres Prefecture|Serres]]/Ser - [[w:Gotse Delchev (town)|Gotse Delchev]]/Nevrokop subregions.

It must be noted that the [[w:Serres Prefecture|Ser]]-[[w:Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop]] group is in fact located mostly outside of the Republic of Macedonia (in Greece and Bulgaria, respectively) and hence its identification as a group of &quot;Macedonian&quot; dialects is an especially controversial issue. Bulgarian linguists regard both as East Bulgarian dialects, more specifically as part of a ''Rupski'' dialect group that stretches through Southern [[w:Thrace]] up to the [[w:Black Sea]] {{ref|stoykov2002b}}. In Greece, all Slavic varieties spoken in the northern part are referred to simply as slavic, except the local Macedonian population does call their local language &quot;Makedonski&quot;

====Variation in vowels====
The vocalic inventories of the West Central dialects consist of five vowels, {{IPA|/i, ɛ, a, ɔ, u/}}. Most of the remaining dialects also have phonemic {{IPA|/ə/}}. In addition, phonemic {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/æ/}}, and {{IPA|/y/}} and vocalic {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} occur in various dialects.

Most dialects have {{IPA|/ɛ/}} from original ě ([[w:yat]]), but the Eastern region is characterised by the development of ě to {{IPA|/a/}} after {{IPA|/c/}}: Eastern ''cal'', Western ''cel'' (whole). Besides that, in easternmost Aegean Macedonia and the [[w:Blagoevgrad Province]] of [[w:Bulgaria]] ě gives {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/æ/}} under stress. In the dialects of Aegean Macedonia, this happens regardless of the environment, whereas the dialects of the Blagoevgrad province have (just like standard Bulgarian and its eastern dialects) {{IPA|/a/}} if there is a back vowel in the following syllable, and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} if there is a front vowel. For example, 'white' (sing. - plur.) sounds in the following way in these dialects: [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]-[[Drama, Greece|Drama]]: {{IPA|/bala/}} - {{IPA|/bali/}}, Suho and Visoka: {{IPA|/bæla/}} - {{IPA|/bæli/}}, Nevrokop: {{IPA|/bala/}} - {{IPA|/bɛli/}}. In Korca, ě becomes {{IPA|/iæ/}} under stress.

====Variation in consonants====
As far as consonantal features are concerned, the entire Western region is distinguished from the East by loss of {{IPA|/x/}} (except [[Tetovo]], Gora and Korča) and the loss of {{IPA|/v/}} in the intervocalic position (except Mala Reka and parts of Kostur-Korča): {{IPA|/glava/}} (head) = {{IPA|/gla/}}, {{IPA|/glavi/}} (heads) = {{IPA|/glaj/}}. The Eastern region preserves {{IPA|/x/}} (except Tikveš-Mariovo and Kumanovo-Kriva Palanka) and intervocalic {{IPA|/v/}}. The East is also characterised by the development of epenthetic {{IPA|/v/}} before original {{IPA|/o/}} where the West has epenthetic {{IPA|/j/}}: Eastern {{IPA|/vaglɛn/}} (''coal'') but Western {{IPA|/jaglɛn/}}. The diphonemic reflexes are most characteristic of the dialects of [[w:Aegean Macedonia|Aegean Macedonia]] and [[Blagoevgrad province]], Kostur-Korča and [[Ohrid]]-[[Prespa]]. The [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]-[[Nevrokop]] dialects have a series of phonemically palatalised consonants.

====Variation in word stress and its effects on vowels====
The Western dialects generally have fixed stress, antepenultimate in the Republic of Macedonia, and penultimate in [[Greece]] and [[Albania]]. The Eastern region, along with the neighbouring Bulgarian dialects, has various non-fixed stress systems. In Lower Vardar and [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]-[[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop]] unstressed {{IPA|/a, ɛ, ɔ/}} are reduced (raised) to {{IPA|[ə, i, u]}}. The reduction of unstressed vowels (as well as the aforementioned allophonic palatalisation of consonants) is characteristic of East Bulgarian as opposed to West Bulgarian dialects, so these dialects are regarded by Bulgarian linguists as transitional between East and West Bulgarian {{ref|stoykov2002c}}..

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a simple application that saves one XML file per form.  You want multiple users to each be editing individual records without conflict.

== Design ==
We will put each term in a separate XML file, and the files will be numbered sequentially - 1.xml, 2.xml, and so on.  Each file defines a single term, its acronym, and its definition.

== Method ==
# Create a new eXist collection (aka Folder if you are using a WebDAV tool) called &quot;dictionary&quot;
# Create three collections called &quot;data&quot;, &quot;edit&quot;, and &quot;views&quot; within the &quot;dictionary&quot; collection.

=== data/1.xml ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Term&gt;
   &lt;id&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
   &lt;TermName&gt;Hello&lt;/TermName&gt;
   &lt;TermDefinition&gt;An informal greeting.&lt;/TermDefinition&gt;
&lt;/Term&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== data/2.xml ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Term&gt;
   &lt;id&gt;2&lt;/id&gt;
   &lt;TermName&gt;Howdy&lt;/TermName&gt;
   &lt;TermDefinition&gt;An informal greeting used by cowboys.&lt;/TermDefinition&gt;
&lt;/Term&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Your XForms application loads the data into an instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;xf:instance src=&quot;1.xml&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

You pass the ID number to an XQuery &quot;edit.xq&quot; as a parameter in the URI, &quot;id&quot;.  &quot;edit.xq&quot; uses the ID parameter as a variable, &quot;$id&quot;, to build the form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discrete Random Variables ==

Discrete random variables are the models for the probabilities of particular results. They are represented by the notation, '''&lt;math&gt;P(X = R)&lt;/math&gt;''' (Where P is the probability of the Discrete Random Variable, X , taking on the result, R.). A discrete random variable can only take on the values '''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' with the probabilities '''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' respectively. Discrete random variables allow us to produce a '''Discrete Frequency Distribution'''. Discrete meaning that the value of the results can only take on positive whole integers. In S1, Discrete distributions are limited to a finite number of outcomes.


== Exemplar Question ==

Questions often involve working with algebra in order to find the probabilities, in OCR(MEI), you will often have to work out the value of '''k''' in order to work out the probabilities.

'''The probability distribution of a discrete random variable, X, is given by

 &lt;math&gt;P(X = R) = \frac {kr}{8} R = 2, 4 ,6 ,8. &lt;/math&gt; '''
'''Find the value of k and tabulate the probability distribution.'''

To find the value of k, we need to tabulate our probabilities and substitute the values of R into the discrete random variable, X.

     R || 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 ||
 p(x=R)|| &lt;math&gt;\frac {k2}{8}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Chemical Kinetics|next=Reaction Rates}}

Chemical kinetics is the study of the rates of chemical reactions.  You may know if a reaction is capable of happening, and you may know how far the reaction will proceed, but you don't know fast it will happen.  Consider two reactions:  the rusting of an iron nail and the combustion of propane.  Both reactions will occur, and both will occur to completion.  The rusting will take years to complete, but propane will combust in an instant.  Furthermore, the nail will rust faster when it's moist, and slower in the presence of less oxygen.  Obviously, there are factors that affect the rates of chemical reactions.  The study of these factors and rates is '''chemical kinetics'''.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Reaction Rate ==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;a\hbox{A} + b\hbox{B} \to c\hbox{C} + d\hbox{D}&lt;/math&gt;
| Consider this generic chemical reaction. (Lower case letters represent the molar coefficients.)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;r = -\frac{1}{a} \frac{d[\hbox{A}]}{dt} = -\frac{1}{b} \frac{d[\hbox{B}]}{dt} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{d[\hbox{C}]}{dt} = \frac{1}{d} \frac{d[\hbox{D}]}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
| The reaction rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the rate of change of the concentration of the substances.  Remember that a substance written inside brackets is its concentration, and it is always raised to the power of its coefficient in the reaction (just like equilibrium expressions).  The reaction rate involves [[Calculus]], but in non-mathematical terms it is simply the rate of change of the concentrations.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;r = k[\hbox{A}]^a[\hbox{B}]^b&lt;/math&gt;
| Actually measuring the rate of change of the reactants and products is difficult.  Instead, the reaction rate can be accurately modeled by a '''rate equation'''.  This is an example of a rate equation that might model the above reaction, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.
|}

In summary, the ''reaction rate'' can be determined using a ''rate equation'', which depends on (among other things) the concentration of the reactants.  The reaction rate essentially measures the speed at which a reaction proceeds.

== Collision Theory ==
{{SideBox|All reactions have activation energy regardless of being endothermic or exothermic.}}Collision theory predicts that reactions occur when molecules collide.  In order for reactants to form products, the reactant molecules must physically collide so that they can rearrange themselves into product molecules.  Only some collisions are ''effective'' because the collision must involve enough energy to allow the reaction to occur.  This is called '''activation energy''', the energy needed to begin a reaction.

Activation energy explains why gasoline will not spontaneously ignite.  First, a small spark or flame must be present.  The heat generated by the spark gives the gasoline molecules enough energy to activate the reaction.  Being highly exothermic, the combustion of gasoline releases a large amount of heat—more than enough to activate further reactions and create a fire.

Collision theory allows us to predict the '''rate constant''' &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for a rate equation (see above).  At a given temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the rate constant is:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = Z \rho e^{-E_a / (RT)}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Universal Gas Constant, &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt; is the activation energy for the reaction, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a predicted-to-actual correction factor, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the '''collision factor'''.  The collision factor can also be calculated mathematically.  It is the average number of reactant particle collisions per unit time.

== Factors Affecting Rate ==

The rate of a reaction is affected by many factors.  These effects can be measured empirically or explained by collision theory.

=== Concentration ===

This is the most obvious factor affecting rate.  Increasing the concentration of the reactants will increase the rate they react.  This is the main purpose of writing a rate equation; the concentrations can be plugged in like variables and the rate can be solved mathematically.  In a rate equation in the form &lt;math&gt;r = k[\hbox{A}]^a[\hbox{B}]^b&lt;/math&gt;, the concentrations are the variables (raised to the powers of their coefficients in the reaction).  All other factors that can affect rate are lumped into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, which is considered a constant.

Collision theory explains this.  Higher concentrations means more molecules packed into a given space.  Therefore, there will be more collisions and thus a faster reaction.

=== Pressure ===

In a reaction of gaseous reactants, the partial pressure of the gases has the same function as the concentration.

{{SideBox|Adding an inert gas like argon will not affect the rate because the partial pressures of the reacting gases remain the same.}}
However, increasing the overall pressure (or decreasing the volume if you remember the [[General Chemistry/Gas Laws|gas laws]]) will also result in a greater reaction rate.  The increased pressure causes the molecules to collide with more force.  More collisions will be effective and therefore products will form faster.

=== Temperature ===

As you should already know, a molecule's kinetic energy is directly proportional to its temperature.  By increasing the temperature, molecules collide more vigorously, and more collisions will be effective.

=== Stirring ===

In a ''heterogeneous reaction'' there are two or more phases of matter interacting, such as a solid dissolving into a liquid.  Stirring or shaking the mixture will speed up the reaction rate.  This is common sense.  When you add sugar to a drink, you stir it because you know it will dissolve faster.  Collision theory would predict this because the stirring would increase the number of collisions between reactant molecules.

In a similar manner, increasing the surface area of a solid reactant will increase the reaction rate.

=== Catalysts/Enzyme ===

[[Image:CatalysisScheme.png|thumb|The activation energy E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is decreased by a catalyst, but the overall reaction does not change.]]

A '''catalyst''' is a substance that helps a reaction proceed without being consumed.  [[General Chemistry/Chemical equations#Other Information|Catalysts]] have already been explored in this book. A Catalyst provides a reaction pathway with lower activation energy.

In biochemistry, an '''enzyme''' is a protein that serves as a catalyst.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

On this page, the Kingdom Eubacteria will be explored. Bacteria are omnipresent; they are in our bodies and in our foods. Bacteria are also prokaryotes; the great majority live as single cells, but they are able to produce colonies or link up in chains to form filaments.

==Classifying bacteria==

There are numerous ways to classify bacteria. 

===Shape===

Since bacteria typically live by themselves, it is easy to distinguish them based on their shape. Bacterial cells have three main shapes:

1) '''cocci''': round with bumps

2) '''bacilli''': rod-shaped with lacerations

3) '''spirilli''': spiral-shaped with grooves

A bacterium's shape can give the bacterium some advantages. For example, spiral bacteria can move through fluids more easily than can cocci or bacilli bacteria.

Furthermore, bacteria can be classified by their growth characteristic patterns (Groupings). The prefix '''diplo-''' denotes cells arranged in pairs. The prefix '''staphylo-''' describes bacteria arranged in clusters like grapes. The prefix '''strepto-''' denotes bacteria arranged in a chain.

===Cell Wall Structure===

1) '''Gram-positive''': Gram-positive bacteria have simple cell walls, composed of only one layer of '''peptidoglycan''' before the plasma membrane. When stained with violet and red dye, gram-positive bacteria appear purple. Sometimes blue, depending on the temperature. The large amount of peptidoglycan in these bacteria traps the violet dye in the cytoplasm, masking the red dye. 

2) '''Gram-negative''': Gram-negative bacteria have more complex cell walls, consisting of one layer of a lipopolysaccharide membrane and a peptidoglycan layer. Gram-negative bacteria appear red.

===Carbon and Energy Sources===

Organisms need energy to do work and carry out metabolism and carbon to build organic cellular structures.

1) '''Photoautotrophs''' - Energy and carbon are both obtained from photosynthesis.

2) '''Photoheterotrophic''' - Energy is obtained from photosynthesis, but carbon must be obtained from food.

3) '''Autotrophic''' - Energy must be obtained from consuming food, while carbon is obtained from photosynthesis.

4) '''Heterotrophic''' - Both energy and carbon must be obtained from food.

==Reproduction of bacteria==

===Asexual reproduction===

Typically, bacteria reproduce asexually. They are not able to reproduce by mitosis or meiosis because they lack nuclei. Instead, they undergo '''binary fission''':

1. The bacterium duplicates its original, single chromosome.

2. With two copies of its original, single chromosome, the cell elongates (stretches) to separate the two chromosomes. 

3. A septum (divider) begins to form between the two copies of chromosomes.

4. The septum finishes forming and divides the one bacterium in two parts.

5. The bacterium separates into two daughter bacteria.

===Sexual reproduction===

In unfavourable conditions, bacteria can reproduce sexually through a process of '''conjugation''':

1. A '''pilus''' (a bridging structure) forms between two bacteria as a link. 

2. One bacterium of the two transfers all or some of its chromosome to the other across the pilus. 

3. With the new genetic content, the receiving bacterium then undergoes binary fusion to produce more cells with the same genetic composition.

===Spore formation===

If the surrounding environment is unfavourable for a bacteria, they may enter a dormant phase so they can protect themselves. In this case, the bacteria develops a tough outer coating surrounding their DNA and a small amount of cytoplasm. This forms small seedlike structures called '''endospores'''. The endospores disintegrate when the living environment becomes favourable again.

When bacteria are protected by endospores, they are more difficult to be killed. However, one reliable method is to subject the endospores to an autoclave, a container which contains highly pressurised steam.

==Genetic Recombination==

The genetic composition of a bacteria can be changed in three ways: '''transduction''', '''transformation''', and '''conjugation'''. Not all of bacteria's chromosomes are in the '''nucleoid''' of bacteria. Some of the bacteria's genes are contained in '''plasmids''', which are small loops of DNA which are separate from the main chromosome. They contain one to a few genes, and they are often different from those found in the chromosome. 

===Transduction===

Transduction occurs when a bacteriophage infects a bacterium and injects the phage's nucleic acid into the bacteria. The phage's nucleic acid then becomes part of the bacteria's DNA. For more information, please see the lesson on Viruses: [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Viruses]].

===Transformation===

1. A bacterium encounters DNA from another dead or damaged bacterium.

2. The recipient bacterium accepts the nucleic acid.

3. The recipient and donor DNA are combined.

4. The recipient cell is now genetically different.

===Conjugation===

Please refer to Sexual Reproduction above.

==Bacteria &amp; Human Health==

As with most things, there are good and bad bacteria. Some examples of good bacteria are nitrifying bacteria and members of the lactobacillus genus. Harmful bacteria can cause pnuemonia, botulism, infections, and many other diseases in the human body. 

To stop unwanted bacteria growth in humans, '''antibiotics''' affect bacteria in many ways. Some prevent the bacteria from building or repairing cell walls or membranes, from making more RNA or DNA, or target certain organelles. Antibiotics generally kill bacteria directly or inhibit their growth to let the body's immune system finish the job.

To select the most effective, physicians must apply understanding and knowledge of bacteria. For example, cephalosporin antibiotics are more effective on gram-negative bacteria.  

==Eubacteria Practice Questions==

1. Give two similarities between binary fission and mitosis.

2. Give two differences between binary fission and meiosis.

3. Classify the following as either photoautotrophic, photoheterotrophic, chemoautotrophic, or chemoheterophic:

:a) sunflower

:b) goldfish

:c) human being

:d) cyanobacteria

:e) iron-oxidising bacteria

4. Between cocci, bacilli, and spirilli bacteria, which type would resist drying the best?

5. Bacteria can help other bacteria resist antibiotics by sharing genetic information.

:a) In what part of the bacteria would such genetic information be located?

:b) Which method of genetic transfer would bacteria most likely use for this purpose?

6. Would it be possible for some bacteria to remain in the endospore stage for hundreds of years? Support your argument.

&lt;strong&gt;Revised:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;February 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
This function prompts the user to select an existing folder. It does this by displaying the standard &amp;quot;Get File&amp;quot; dialog shown below (its appearance may be different on some systems). If the user selects a folder, then the folder's name is returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;folderName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and a reference number for the folder is returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which must be a short integer variable). If the selected folder is in a volume's root directory, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will return a volume reference number; otherwise, it will return a working directory reference number. If the user cancels the dialog, then the function returns an empty (zero-length) string, and it sets &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to zero.

The information contained in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;folderName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the correct name for the folder but is not of any real value except to determine that the user has selected Choose instead of Cancel. Only the volume reference number is necessary when using FB's file handling routines.

If the global variable &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero, FB switches to the more modern Navigation Services dialog. If the FSSpec version of the call is used, &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are programming for Carbon, the &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices = _zTrue&lt;/code&gt; statement is required.

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;February, 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
This function prompts the user to select an existing file. It does this by displaying the standard &amp;quot;Get File&amp;quot; dialog shown below (its appearance may be different on some systems). If the user selects a file, then the file's name is returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;fileName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and a reference number for the file's directory is returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which must be a short integer variable). If the selected file is in a volume's root directory, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;will return a volume reference number; otherwise, it will return a working directory reference number. If the user cancels the dialog, then the function returns an empty (zero-length) string, and it sets &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to zero.

If the global variable &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero, FB switches to the more modern Navigation Services dialog. If the one of the FSSpec version of the call is used, &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;.

You can limit the types of files that appear in the dialog by specifying up to four file types in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeListString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, is you pass the string &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;TEXTPICT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeListString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then only files of type &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; and type &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;PICT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; will be available for selection. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeListString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an empty string, or the parameter is omitted, then all file types will be available for selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image was here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the optional &lt;code&gt;_fOpenPreview&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;_FSSpecOpenPreview&lt;/code&gt; ) parameter, the standard files dialog may display a preview of the file currently selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt;(_fOpen&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; function does not actually open the selected file. Use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement if you need to open the file.

The reference number returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a temporary number, which is only valid until your program quits. You cannot use this same number to refer to this folder at a later date. If you need to keep track of a file's location over time, create and save an alias record for the file.

&lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices = _zTrue|_false&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;February, 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
This function prompts the user to provide a file name, and to select a folder where the file may be saved. It does this by displaying the standard &amp;quot;Put File&amp;quot; dialog shown below (its appearance may be different on some systems). If the user selects a name, then the name is returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;fileName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and a reference number for the selected directory is returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which must be a short integer variable). If the selected directory is a volume's root directory, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will return a volume reference number; otherwise, it will return a working directory reference number. If the user cancels the dialog, then the function returns an empty (zero-length) string, and it sets &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;to zero.

The string (if any) that you provide in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;prompt$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will appear as a one-line prompt in the dialog. The string (if any) that you provide in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;defaultName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will appear initially in the file name edit field in the dialog.

If the global variable &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero, FB switches to the more modern Navigation Services dialog.. If the one of the FSSpec version of the call is used, &lt;code&gt;gFBUseNavServices&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The statement:

&lt;code&gt;fileName$ = &lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt;(_fSave,&amp;quot;Save game as:&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Game 1&amp;quot;,refNum%)&lt;/code&gt;

will produce a dialog that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt;(_fSave&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; function does not actually open or save a file. Use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPEN&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement if you need to open a file, and use output statements like &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WRITE#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to save information into it.

The reference number returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNumVar%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a temporary number, which is only valid until your program quits. You cannot use this same number to refer to this folder at a later date. If you need to keep track of a file's location over time, create and save an alias record for the file.

✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;fileType$&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the file type of the last file returned by the &lt;code&gt;FILES$(_fOpen&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; function, as a 4-character string. If the user clicked &amp;quot;cancel&amp;quot; in response to the last File Open dialog, or if the &lt;code&gt;FILES$(_fOpen&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; function has never yet been executed, then the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;function returns an empty (zero-length) string.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In some cases it's useful to express the file type as a 4-byte long integer rather than as a string. Use the &lt;code&gt;MKI$&lt;/code&gt; function and the &lt;code&gt;CVI&lt;/code&gt; function to convert between these two forms.

=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILL&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement fills the area around pixel coordinates (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) (in the current output window) with the current color and pen pattern. All the contiguous pixels which have a color equal to the original color at (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are included in the fill.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;This little program paints a red ring:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLOR&lt;/b&gt; = _zBlack&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt; 110,110,100&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt; 110,110,80&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COLOR&lt;/b&gt; = _zRed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FILL&lt;/b&gt; 100, 15&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Graphics Window before executing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's a switch using typical Sway syntax:

    var x = 0;
    
    switch (x)
        {
        case(3) { println(&quot;greater&quot;); }
        case(2) { println(&quot;equal&quot;); }
        else    { println(&quot;less&quot;); }
        }

To implement ''switch'', we start by defining the
''case'' function in anticipation of it being filtered.

    function case(operand,$action,$)
        {
        list(operand,$action,$);
        }

Remember, a filter takes each statement in turn, so as
we saw with filtering ''pop'', one line functions are the
best to filter.

The strategy for ''switch'':

* create a filter with the switch expression in scope
* have the filter throw a '''success''' exception
* attach the filter to ''case''
* run the body of the switch, looking for success

    function switch(expr,$actions)
        {
        var result;
        function caseFilter(spec)
            {
            var val;
            if (expr == spec[0])
                {
                throw(:success,force(spec[1]));
                }
            else if (spec[2] != :null)
                {
                throw(:success,force(spec[2][0]));
                }
            }
        case . filter = caseFilter;
        result = catch(force($actions));
        if (error?(result))
            {
            if(result . type == :success,result . value,throw(result));
            }
        else
            {
            :null;
            }
        }

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Answers may vary. Some possibilities are:

:1) Binary fission produces two identical daughter cells.

:2) Daughter cells have 2n chromosomes; the daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

:3) Binary fission commences with a duplicate of the original chromosome.

2. Answers may vary. Some possibilities:

:1) Binary fission produces only two identical daughter cells.

:2) Daughter bacterial cells have 2n chromosomes, unlike n chromosomes for gametes.

:3) Binary fission transpires only in bacteria, and not in gametes.

:4) Binary fission does not involve any spindle fibres or asters.

3. 

:a) photoautotrophic

:b) chemoheterophic

:c) chemoheterophic

:d) photoautotrophic

:e) chemoautotrophic

4. Cocci; least surface area.

5. 

:a) Plasmids

:b) Conjugation.

6. Yes, because endospores are quite robust.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== NOT == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;value = NOT expr&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator interprets &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as an integer, and returns another integer in whose internal bit pattern all the bits are flipped to their opposite state (i.e., all 1's are changed to 0; and all 0's are changed to 1). Coincidentally, because of the way that integers are stored in FB, the value returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; equals:&lt;code&gt; -(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt; + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.

One common use for &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is to reverse the sense of an expression whose value equals &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt; (-1) or &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt; (0). Note that &lt;code&gt;(&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt;_zTrue)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;(&lt;b&gt;NOT &lt;/b&gt;_false)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;. You must be careful when using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; values other than -1. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
testValue = 35
IF testValue &lt;b&gt;THEN BEEP&lt;/b&gt; 'This produces a beep&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;IF NOT&lt;/b&gt; testValue &lt;b&gt;THEN BEEP&lt;/b&gt; 'But so does this!
&lt;/pre&gt;

This program produces two beeps, because in the second &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement, &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; testValue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; produces the value -36, which is still interpreted as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; by the &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Another common use for &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is to help you set or reset individual bits in a bit pattern. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;ÊÊÊpattern&amp;amp; = pattern&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;AND NOT BIT&lt;/b&gt;(7)&lt;/pre&gt;

This sets bit 7 in &lt;code&gt;pattern&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to zero, and leaves all of &lt;code&gt;pattern&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;'s other bits alone.

&lt;code&gt;AND; OR; XOR&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== eDonkey ==
eDonkey the original client for the [[w:eDonkey network|eDonkey network]] (also known as eDonkey2000 network or eD2k), was created and managed by MetaMachines (Sam Yagan and Jed McCaleh) based on the city of new York. It had a stable P2P community and the protocol was older than BitTorrent it was created in 2002 shortly after the closing of Napster and competed with the FastTrack network. In June of 2005, the entertainment industry gained a victory in the Supreme Court (USA) that stated that every file-sharing developer could be sued for copyright infringement if they induced such behavior. In September 2005 the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sent several commercial P2P developer cease and desist letters including to MetaMachines and with no founds to battle the interpretation of the Supreme Court decision, Sam Yagan conceded defeat as he testified to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;...I am not here as an active participant in the future of P2P, but rather as one who has thrown in his towel and with no interest in replaying past issues...&quot;|caption=--Sam Yagan}}

On September 11, 2006 users could not get the eDonkey2000 client software, in  September 12, 2006 MetaMachines settles for $30 Million (US) and the agreement closes any avenue MetaMachines had in dealing with any P2P technology in the future...

The eDonkey networks is centralized (as it depends on serves) to provide decentralized sharing of content (not stored on the servers), there are still many software implementations that support the network the most popular is eMule.

=== Protocol ===
&quot;The eMule Protocol Specification&quot; ( http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=53489&amp;package_id=145950 ) by Yoram Kulbak and Danny Bickson DANSS (Distributed Algorithms, Networking and Secure Systems) Lab - School of Computer Science and Engineering - The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel - January 20, 2005, PDF document provided by the Emule Project.

=== Kademlia ===
Started as the [[w:Overnet|Overnet]] project by Jed McCaleb, the creator of [[w:eDonkey2000|eDonkey2000]] to overcome the need of servers.  Overnet implemented the [[w:Kademlia|Kademlia]] algorithm. In late 2006, Overnet and all Overnet-owned resources were taken down as a result of legal actions from the [[w:RIAA|RIAA]] and others.  However, since the core of Overnet is decentralized, Overnet clients are still able to function with limited functionality.

The KadC library (http://kadc.sourceforge.net/ ) provides an OpenSource C library to publishing and retrieving records in Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Tables.

A some what old paper named [http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/109.pdf Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric] by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières can also be a source of information about the protocol.

The network is now known as Kademlia and is supported by many of the implementations of the old eDonkey/Overnet clients, especially by the [[w:eMule|eMule]] project. Kademlia is a research effort to implement a full-featured peer-to-peer system based on the [[w:Exclusive or|XOR]] metric [[w:Routing|routing]]. Of special interest are the objectives for efficient data storage and query; anonymity; network, content and user security and authentication.

=== eMule content database ===
[[Image:EMule mascot.svg|60px|left|eMule mascot.]]&lt;br&gt;
( http://content.emule-project.net/ ) a service provided by the eMule project team for the eDonkey2000 and Kad network users, to make free content available for download and easy to find. The content database has been on line since around new years 2004.

=== Software Implementations ===
*'''eMule''' ( http://www.emule-project.net/ ) a filesharing software implementation based on the eDonkey2000 network but offers more features than the standard client, open source C++/MFC and windows only, licensed under GPL ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/emule/ )
*'''Xmod''' ( http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/x-mod/ ) The Xmod is a Project is based on the eMule Client, OpenSource under the GPL.

      <comment>/* Direct Connect */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Direct Connect ==
Direct connect is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol/network but it uses a central server, this reliance on a central point can also be seen on the old Napster network, in that each server build an independent network (not an hybrid like for instance with eMule). One should note that some clients are now also implementing DHTs that will result in unifying used networks.  The Direct Connect protocol was originally developed by Jonathan Hess for use on the Neo-Modus Direct Connect (NMDC) v1, released September 2001 and partially in NMDC v2, released in July 2003.

Direct Connect defines the servers as HUBs. Clients connect to a central hub and that hub feature a list of clients or users connected to it. Users can then search for files to download, or as chat with other users present (on that server).

Direct Connect also implements Tiger tree hashing (TTH) for for file transfers.

=== NMDC Protocol ===
created by Jon Hess at Neo-modus
protocol mirror ( http://www.teamfair.info/wiki/index.php )

=== ADC Protocol ===
The ADC protocol ( http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/ADC.html ) is similar to the Neo-Modus Direct Connect (NMDC) protocol. It consists of a text protocol for a client-server network, created with goal to be simple, yet extensible.

Jon Hess contributed to the creation of this protocol with the original Direct Connect idea through the Neo-Modus Direct Connect client / hub. Other major contributing source was Jan Vidar Krey's DCTNG draft that lead to subsequent work by Dustin Brody, Walter Doekes, Timmo Stange, Fredrik Ullner, Fredrik Stenberg and others.

=== HUB Software Implementations ===
*'''DConnect Daemon''' ( http://www.dc.ds.pg.gda.pl/ ), an open source Direct Connect's hub (working as daemon) written in C. Works currently under GNU Linux and FreeBSD, but is planned to be able to work on all Unixes and Windows. As a daemon it works in background and does not require any Xwindow system. Supports a telnet administration console.

=== Client Software Implementations ===
* '''NeoModus Direct Connect'''
* [[w:DC plus plus|'''DC++''']] ( http://dcpp.net/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/ ), a project aimed at producing a file sharing client using the ADC protocol. It also supports connecting to the Direct Connect network, open source under GPL, using C++/MFC running on Windows. It is developed primarily by Jacek Sieka, nicknamed arnetheduck.
* '''BCDC++'''
* '''RevConnect''' ( http://www.revconnect.com/ ), supports also Kademlia, Open Source under GPL, using C++/MFC running on Windows.
* '''Strong DC++''' ( http://strongdc.berlios.de/download.php?lang=eng ), Open Source under GPL, using C++/MFC running on Windows.
* '''ApexDC++''' ( http://www.peerwebdc.tk/ - http://sourceforge.net/projects/apexdc/ ), based on Strong DC++. It has numerous features such as a plugin to block IP addresses (uses PeerGuardian blocklist), super seeding, customization, themes, and a nice Vista-type general user, Open Source under GPL, using C++/MFC running on Windows.
* '''TkDC++''' ( http://tkdcpp.com ), Open Source under GPL, using C++/MFC running on Windows.
* '''GtkDC''' (http://gna.org/projects/gtkdc/), a Direct Connect client written in C, based on a GIMP toolkit 2.0 GUI. It is intended to run on UNIX-based platforms, but with a little port it should be executable on Windows platform with Gtk libraries. Licensed under the GNU General Public License V2 or later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Napster ==
The Napster network was created at application-level using a client-server protocol over point-to-point TCP. The server was in this case a centralized directory that would hold an index of all files offered (MP3/WMA). The clients would connect to the server, identify themselves to the server (users had an account on the server) and send a list of MP3/WMA files they were sharing to it enabling other clients to search that central repository for any file on the network and then request it from any available source.

==== Software Implementation ====
*[[w:Opennap|OpenNap]] ( http://opennap.sourceforge.net ), a Napster based peer-to-peer, created as open source (GPL), in C using Win32, and so for Windows. Intended to extend the Napster protocol to allow sharing of any media type, and adding the ability to link servers together. Discontinued.
*'''audioGnome''' ( http://www.audiognome.com ), closed source but as freeware for Windows.
*'''JNerve''' ( http://jnerve.sourceforge.net ), an open source (GPL) Java Napster Server Protocol implementation with a goal of cross-platform compatibility.
*'''Napsack''' ( http://napsack.sourceforge.net ) is a specialized multi-threaded client for broadcasting Napster queries across multiple servers; the list of target servers is retrieved from www.napigator.com, and is user-filterable (based on the number of users, files, or gigs indexed). Opensourced (GPL) using Java.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BitTorrent ==
{{TOC right}}
[[w:BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] is a protocol ( [http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification BitTorrent Protocol Specification v1.0] ) created by [[w:Bram Cohen|Bram Cohen]] derived from the Gnutella concept, but primarily designed to distribute large computer files over the Internet and permit WEB integration, in fact it aimed to be a substitute for the old centralized HTTP downloads, not a full P2P network. As such it initially avoided the limitations of transmitting search request across the network, something that recently has been implemented with the adoption of a DHT similar to the eDonkey solution, that permits searches across a network. Making BitTorrent a two tiers P2P. 

BitTorrent is used to distribute legitimate content but in itself does not make any differentiation about the copyright status of the shared material, as any other decentralized network this permits infringement on a massive scale. Bram Cohen and [[w:Ashwin Navin|Ashwin Navin]] founded on September 22, 2004, [[w:BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent, Inc.]] headquartered in [[w:San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[w:California|California]], as a privately held  [[w:United States|American]] [[w:company|company]] that develops transformative technology and products to continue the advancement of a more efficient and open Internet also promotes development of the BitTorrent protocol through R&amp;D and open specifications.

BitTorrent ( http://www.bittorrent.com ) is also the name of the original implementation of the protocol it started as a [[Subject:Python_programming_language|Python]] ( [http://download.bittorrent.com/dl/?C=M;O=D source code and old versions] ) application, now refereed as BitTorrent Mainline, to a full featured commercial enterprise. BitTorrent.com part of BitTorrent Inc. is now a destination to download entertainment content using the BitTorrent protocol.  The site provide fast, on-demand access to the most comprehensive licensed catalog of thousands of movies, TV shows, music and games, but it also provides content creators a publishing platform to list their works in high-quality alongside the most recognizable titles from major movie studios, TV networks, and record labels.

BitTorrent Inc. also contributes through more broadly focused standards bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) at the LEDBAT working group ( http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ledbat-charter.html ). BitTorrent, Inc. owns the clients BitTorrent Mainline and [[w:μTorrent|µTorrent]], as the [[w:BitTorrent DNA|BitTorrent DNA]] (Delivery Network Accelerator) which is a free content delivery service based on the BitTorrent protocol that brings the power of user-contributed bandwidth to traditional content publishers while leaving publishers in full control of their files.

The BitTorrent protocol is peer-to-peer in nature, its innovative approach in the beginning, was due to not be centered about the creation a real distributed network but around the specific shared resources, in this case files, preferably large files, as users connect to each other directly to send and receive portions of a large file from other peers who have also downloaded either the file or parts of the it. These pieces are then reassembled into the full file.  Since the users are downloading from each other and not from one central server, the bandwidth load of downloading large files is divided between the many sources that the user is downloading from. This decreases the bandwidth cost for people hosting large files, and increases the download speeds for the people downloading large files, because the protocol makes use of the upstream bandwidth of every downloader to increase the effectiveness of the distribution as a whole, and to gain advantage on the part of the downloader. However, there is a central server (called a tracker) which coordinates the action of all such peers. The tracker only manages connections, it does not have any knowledge of the contents of the files being distributed, and therefore a large number of users can be supported with relatively limited tracker bandwidth.

The key philosophy of BitTorrent is that users should upload (transmit outbound) at the same time they are downloading (receiving inbound.) In this manner, network bandwidth is utilized as efficiently as possible. BitTorrent is designed to work better as the number of people interested in a certain file increases, in contrast to other file transfer protocols.

BitTorrent is redefining the way people share and search for content and is getting very popular for downloading movies, TV shows, full music albums and applications (it gains in performance with other alternatives) since it is very file specific and it gains on the &quot;new&quot; factor of P2P content, more users equals more speed, but it will not be the optimum solution to rare files or to distribute content that is not highly sought over.

To download files that are hosted using BitTorrent users must have a BitTorrent client and to publish a file one must run a tracker.

In November 2004, BitTorrent accounted for an astounding 35 percent of all the traffic on the Internet and in 2006 the BitTorrent protocol has risen to over 60 percent of all Internet traffic according to British Web analysis firm CacheLogic. Due to this some ISPs are doing traffic shaping also know as bandwidth throttling, meaning they are reducing the protocol priority  inside their networks and reducing its overall performance this has resulted in two kind of responses, some ISPs are investing in upgrading their networks and provide local cache to the protocol and implementors of the protocol are starting to battle ISPs that refuse to adapt by encrypting and randomizing it, this kick need to adapt and the increasing popularity due to deviation from its creators vision is placing more and more its evolution on the hands of independent developers.

The BitTorrent system is highly dependent on active participation of peers since it only goal is the sharing of files. Rare and &quot;old&quot; content is not easy to find on the system, only highly sought after content benefit from this P2P implementation. Small files also don't fully benefit from it, since the needed time for replication is too short and in some extreme situations can even degrade the experience.  

=== Content indexers ===
There are many different BitTorrent websites that index content, each providing information about files distributed via the BitTorrent protocol. They typically contain multiple torrent files and an index of those files. In a typical scenario, a user would enter such a site and browse or search for the content they desire, based on the torrent descriptions posted at the site by other users. If a torrent with the sought content is found, the user could download that torrent.

Legal Torrents ( http://www.legaltorrents.com ), a collection of Creative Commons-licensed, legally downloadable, freely distributable creator-approved files, from electronic/indie music to movies and books, which have been made available via BitTorrent. Everyone that grabs the BitTorrent client and downloads helps contribute more bandwidth. 

There is also OpenBitTorrent ( http://openbittorrent.com ), OpenBitTorrent.kg ( http://www.openbittorrent.kg ), myTorrentTracker ( http://www.mytorrenttracker.com ) and trackhub ( http://trackhub.appspot.com ), all BitTorrent trackers free for anyone to use to share files. You don't need to register, upload or index a torrent anywhere, all you have to do is to include the tracker URL in the torrent file.

Other:
*bt.etree.org ( http://bt.etree.org/ ), a site provided by the etree.org community for sharing the live concert recordings of trade friendly artists.
*The Pirate Bay ( http://thepiratebay.org ).
*mininova ( http://www.mininova.org/ ).

Such websites each have different features to facilitate the user's search. See Wikipedia's [[w:Comparison of BitTorrent sites|Comparison of BitTorrent sites]] page. Several of the larger BitTorrent tracker sites were shut down citing concerns about problems with copyright holders, mostly representatives of large  business interests. While in short it does prevent large scale copyright infringement, it also creates difficulty to legal uses and there is the issue with false notifications, that is claiming infringement of rights over works they do not own. In the long run this does little to solve the problem and pressures the protocol to evolve in ways to avoid this type of disruption. One way people have adapted to this pressure is to create private trackers that are only available by invitation.

=== Protocol ===
As already discussed the BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing files. It identifies content by URL and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the web. Its advantage over plain HTTP is that when multiple downloads of the same file happen concurrently, where each downloaders upload to each other, making it possible for the file source to support very large numbers of downloaders with only a modest increase in its load. ( http://www.bittorrent.com/protocol.html ). BitTorrent share some of the nomenclature of other P2P protocols but also creates new ones (see Wikipedia's page [[w:BitTorrent vocabulary|BitTorrent vocabulary]] for an extended list).

;Torrent:A ''torrent'' can mean either a &lt;code&gt;.torrent&lt;/code&gt; [[w:metadata|metadata]] file or all files described by it, depending on context. The '''[[w:Torrent file|torrent file]]''', as defined in the BitTorrent specification, contains the URLs of multiple [[w:BitTorrent tracker|trackers]], that coordinates communication between the peers in the swarm, and integrity metadata about all the files it makes down-loadable, including their names and sizes and [[w:Hash list|checksums]] of all pieces in the ''torrent''. It can also contain additional metadata defined in extensions to the BitTorrent specification, known as ''BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals''. Examples of such proposals include metadata for stating who created the torrent, and when.

;[[w:BitTorrent index|Index]]:An ''index'' is a list of .torrent files (usually including descriptions and other information) managed by a [[w:website|website]] and available for searches. An ''index'' website can also be sometimes refereed as a ''tracker'', but as a &quot;Torrent&quot; tracked not BitTorrent tracker).

The protocol was partially dependent of centralized in do to the requirement of trackers.

;Client:The program that enables [[w:Peer-to-peer|p2p]] [[w:file sharing|file sharing]] via the BitTorrent protocol. It denotes still the semi-centralized nature of the protocol, on the protocol definition sometimes the terms is substituted by Peer (ie: [http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#peer_id peer_id]), for instance Gnutella refers to participants always as Peers or Nodes and to implementer as Vendor.

;Tracker:A [[w:BitTorrent tracker|tracker]] is a server that keeps track of which seeds and peers are in the swarm. Clients report information to the tracker periodically and in exchange receive information about other clients to which they can connect. The tracker is not directly involved in the data transfer and does not have a copy of the file.

;[[w:Tracker scrape|Scrape]]:This is when a client sends a request to the tracking server for information about the statistics of the torrent, such as with whom to share the file and how well those other users are sharing.

With the adoption of DHT (Distributed Hash Tables) the BitTorrent protocol starts to become more that a semi-centralized distribution network around a single resource, it becomes more decentralized and removes the static point of control, the tracker, this is done by relying in DHTs and the use of the [[The_World_of_Peer-to-Peer_(P2P)/Networks_and_Protocols/BitTorrent#Peer_exchange|PEX]] extension. Enabling the volatile Peer to operate also as a tracker, but even if this addressed the need for static tracker servers, there is still a centralization of the network around the content. Peers don't have any default ability to contact each other outside of that context.

;Seeder:A ''seeder'' is a ''client'' that has a complete copy of the torrent and still offers it for upload. The more ''seeders'' there are, the better the chances of getting a higher download speed. If the seeder seeds the whole copy of the download they should get faster downloads

Seeding rules, like we will see with the special case of ''super-seeding'', are variables and algorithms implemented locally by the client in a general configuration often open in some form to user control. These rules control and may serve to optimize the selection of what available torrent is seeded, instead of just starting the next one in the list, and sort torrents based on a '''Seeding Rank'''.

;Seeding Rank:Is a priority rating, resulting from the calculations based on the active seeding rules of the client, serving to prioritizes your torrents based on how needy they are. It generates a priority queue, where the available torrents are given use of the available open slots for transfer. Several consideration can contribute to the ''Seeding Rank'':
:*Seed Ratio. The lower the ratio, the more scarce a the torrent is, the higher its Seeding Rank should be, giving priority to rare torrents.
:*Seed Count. Similar to Seed ratio but considers not only complete seeds but the number of any client interested in the torrent, works in reverse, giving preference to larger swarms and torrents in high demand.
:*Timed Rotation. Torrents will be rotated in and out of seeding mode. Each torrent is given a length of time they remain seeding.  
:*Default. Each torrents will be seeded based on their order they are added to the seed list. 

;Announce:Similar to &quot;Scrape&quot;, but means that the client also announces that it wants to join the swarm and that the server should add it to the list of peers in that swarm.

;Availability (also known as Distributed copies.): This is a common word used on distributed systems, in this case it refers to  the number of full copies of the file available to the client. Each seed adds 1.0 to this number, as they have one complete copy of the file. A connected peer with a fraction of the file available adds that fraction to the availability, if no other peer has this part of the file.
:''Example:'' a peer with 65.3% of the file downloaded increases the availability by 0.653. However, if two peers both have the same portion of the file downloaded - say 50% - and there is only one seeder, the availability is 1.5.

;Interested:Describes a downloader who wishes to obtain pieces of a file the client has. For example, the uploading client would flag a downloading client as 'interested' if that client did not possess a piece that it did, and wished to obtain it.

;Downloader:A ''downloader'' is any peer that does not have the entire file and is downloading the file.  This term, used in [[w:Bram Cohen|Bram Cohen's]] [[w:Python (programming language)|Python]] implementation,  lacks the negative connotation attributed to ''leech''.  Bram chose the term ''downloader'' over ''[[w:Leech (computing)|leech]]'' because BitTorrent's tit-for-tat ensures downloaders also upload and thus do not unfairly qualify as ''leeches''.

;Choked:Describes a client that has been refused file pieces. A client ''chokes'' another client in several situations:
:* The second client is a ''seed'', in which case it does not want any pieces (i.e., it is completely ''uninterested'')
:* The client is already uploading at its full capacity (it has reached the value of &lt;code&gt;max_uploads&lt;/code&gt;)
:* The second client has been [[w:Blacklist (computing)|blacklisted]] for being abusive or is using a blacklisted BitTorrent client.

;Snubbed:An uploading client is flagged as ''snubbed'' if the downloading client has not received any data from it in over 60 seconds.

Created by Arvid Norberg and Ludvig Strigeus, (description http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/extension_protocol.html ), it is an extension to the protocol that intends to provide a simple and thin transport for future extensions to the BitTorrent protocol. This protocol makes it easy to add new extensions without interfering with the standard bittorrent protocol or clients that don't support this extension.

The extension messages IDs are defined in the handshake is to avoid having a global registry of message IDs. Instead the names of the extension messages requires unique names, which is much easier to do without a global registry.

There seems also to be a concurrent implementation, or variation, by Vuze ( http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Azureus_messaging_protocol ) that is used both by Vuse and Transmission.

=== Peer exchange ===
'''[[w:Peer exchange|Peer exchange]]''' or '''PEX''' is a [[w:communications protocol|communications protocol]] that augments the [[w:BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] file sharing protocol. It allows a group of users (or [[w:Peer-to-peer|peers]]) that are collaborating to share a given file to do so more swiftly and efficiently. PEX is implemented using one of two common extension protocols.

In the original design of the BitTorrent file sharing protocol clients, that users (Peers) in a file sharing group (known as a &quot;swarm&quot;) relied upon a central computer server called a [[w:BitTorrent tracker|tracker]] to find each other and to maintain the swarm. PEX greatly reduces the reliance of peers on a tracker by allowing each peer to directly update others in the swarm as to which peers are currently in the swarm. By reducing dependency on a centralized tracker, PEX increases the speed, efficiency, and robustness of the BitTorrent protocol making it more decentralized.   

As already explained, users wishing to obtain a copy of a file typically first download a [[w:Torrent_file|.torrent]] file that describes the file(s) to be shared, as well as the [[w:URL|URLs]] of one or more central computers called [[w:BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] that maintain a list of peers currently sharing the file(s) described in the .torrent file.  In the original BitTorrent design, peers then depended on this central tracker to find each other and maintain the swarm. Later development of [[w:distributed hash table|distributed hash table]]s (DHTs) meant that partial lists of peers could be held by other computers in the swarm and the load on the central tracker computer could be reduced. PEX allows peers in a swarm to exchange information about the swarm directly without asking [[w:Polling (computer science)|(polling]]) a tracker computer or a DHT.  By doing so, PEX leverages the knowledge of peers that a user is connected to by asking them for the addresses of peers that they are connected to. This is faster and more efficient than relying solely on a tracker and reduces the processing load on the tracker. It also keep swarms together when the tracker is down. In fact removing any control over the distribution once a peer keeps a complete copy of the file share. 

Peer exchange cannot be used on its own to introduce a new peer to a swarm. To make initial contact with a swarm, each peer must either connect to a tracker using a &quot;.torrent&quot; file, or else use a router computer called a [[w:bootstrap node|bootstrap node]] to find a distributed hash table (DHT) which describes a swarm's list of peers.  For most BitTorrent users, DHT and PEX will start to work automatically after the user launches a BitTorrent client and opens a .torrent file. A notable exception is &quot;private torrents&quot; which are not freely available; these will disable DHT.

It was agreed between the Azureus and µTorrent developers that any clients which implement either of the mechanisms above try to obey the following limits when sending PEX messages:
* There should be no more than 50 added peers and 50 removed peers sent in any given PEX message.
* A peer exchange message should not be sent more frequently than once a minute. 

Some clients may choose to enforce these limits and drop connections from clients that ignore these limits.

=== Permanent DHT tracking ===
With the PEX implementation and reliance on the distributed hash table (DHT), the evolution into creating a real P2P overlay network that is completely serverless was the next logical stem, much like the eDonkey network has evolved as we have seen.  The DHT works mostly the same way and will take information not only from old trackers by also from the PEX implementation, creating something like a distributed Database of shared torrents acting as backup tracker when all other trackers are down or can't deliver enough peers, as well as enabling trackerless torrents. The DHT acts and is added to torrents as a pseudo-tracker if the client has the option enabled and DHT trackers can be enabled and disabled per torrent just like regular trackers. Clients using this permanent DHT tracking are now a fully connected decentralized P2P network, they enter the DHT as a new node, this of course makes it necessary for private trackers (or non-public distributions) to exclude themselves from the participating.

;Bootstrapping the DHT
Since the DHT is independent of any single tracker (and point of failure), the issue of how the DHT routing table is bootstraped, the first time using DHT, has to be addressed. This is done in several ways:
# Manually entering a host name and port number of a DHT node.
# Connect to a tracker that has a .torrent file with a list of DHT nodes. 
# Downloading any torrent with peers who advertise that they support DHT. Not fully supported by all clients as it requires clients to advertise in the BitTorrent handshake DHT support.

;Magnet links
Traditionally, .torrent files are downloaded from torrent sites. But several clients also support the [[w:Magnet URI scheme|Magnet URI scheme]]. A magnet link can provide not only the torrent hash needed to seek the needed nodes sharing the file in the DHT but may include a tracker for the file.

=== BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal (BEP) ===
The BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal Process (BEP) is a process started by John Hoffman. The process is defined in the public domain document ( http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0001.html ).

List of BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals is available ( http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0000.html ).

A BEP is a design document providing information to the BitTorrent community, or describing a new feature for the BitTorrent protocols. BEPs should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature, and are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into BitTorrent.

The BEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. Because the BEPs are maintained as re-structured text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

=== Super-seeding ===
'''[[w:Super-seeding|Super-seeding]]''' specified in BEP 16 ( http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0016.html ) is a extension to the [[w:BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent protocol]] (implemented without changes to the protocol), intended to be used when there is only one [[w:Terminology of BitTorrent|seed]], it permits to manage the scarcity of a resource.

In a situation when a seeder detects that it is the only source for a file, it will attempt to minimize the amount of data uploaded, as to guarantee external sharing and optimize access to the scarce resource, until it detects that other complete seeders exist. The feature was conceived by John Hoffman and first implemented in the [[w:BitTornado|BitTornado]] client in 2003.

=== uTP ===
'''uTP''' or '''µTP''' (sometimes also referred as '''[[w:Micro Transport Protocol|Micro Transport Protocol]]''' ) is an [[w:open source|open source]] [[w:cross-platform|cross-platform]] [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]], created to be implemented on top of [[w:User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocol a TCP-like implementation of [http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ledbat/charter/ LEDBAT] (a [[w:TCP congestion avoidance algorithm|TCP congestion avoidance algorithm]]).

µTP was developed within [[w:BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent, Inc.]] with no input from either the networking or BitTorrent communities as to be provide reliable, ordered delivery while maintaining minimum extra delay as too automatically slow down the rate at which packets of data are transmitted between users of [[w:peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer]] file sharing [[w:BitTorrent (protocol)|torrents]] when it interferes with other applications.  For example, the protocol should automatically allow the sharing of an ADSL line between a BitTorrent application and a web browser. It was first introduced in the µTorrent 1.8.x beta branches, and publicized in the alpha builds of [[w:µTorrent|µTorrent]] 1.9. as is now the primary transport protocol for uTorrent peer-to-peer connections.

uTP is documented as a BitTorrent extension, in BEP 29 ( http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html ). BitTorrent, Inc. has made a C++ implementation available under the MIT license ( http://github.com/bittorrent/libutp ), but the external interface is strictly C (ANSI C89).

=== BitTorrent protocol encryption ===
As of January 2005, BitTorrent traffic made up more than a third of total residential Internet traffic. Some ISPs decided to take different measures control and event to subvert P2P traffic, as covered in [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/What is Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Shadow play#ISPs|Shadow play]] section of this book.

This created a need for providing a [[w:BitTorrent protocol encryption|BitTorrent protocol encryption]]. Obfuscation and encryption makes traffic harder to detect and monitor and therefore harder to throttle. BitTorrent protocol encryption is not designed to provide [[w:anonymity|anonymity]] or [[w:confidentiality|confidentiality]], even if some solutions will it increase confidentiality by obfuscating the content.

Bram Cohen, the inventor of [[w:BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], opposed adding encryption to the BitTorrent protocol.  Cohen stated he was worried that encryption could create incompatibility between clients, stressing the point that the majority of ISPs don't block the torrent protocol.  Cohen wrote &quot;I rather suspect that some developer has gotten rate limited by his ISP, and is more interested in trying to hack around his ISP's limitations than in the performance of the Internet as a whole&quot;. After some criticism for this position, Cohen later added the ability to receive but not originate encrypted connections on his [[w:BitTorrent (software)|Mainline client]]. Notably, when µTorrent was purchased by BitTorrent, Inc. and then became the next mainline release, the ability to originate encrypted connections was retained, but it became turned off by default.

Encryption will not stop a traffic shaping system configured to universally slow down all encrypted, unidentifiable or unknown protocols using a method as simple as packet loss.  Encrypting tracker communications prevents eavesdropping on peer lists and does not require upgrading both ends of peer-to-peer connections, but it requires imposing computational overhead on the tracker.

;Protocol header encryption (PHE):Created by RnySmile and first implemented in BitComet version 0.60 on 8 September 2005. The specifications was neither published, nor is it compatible with MSE/PE, and there are claims that it was already reverse engineered, reducing its usefulness.

;Message stream encryption (MSE)/Protocol encryption (PE):Developed by Azureus (now Vuze) in late January 2006, that later suffered several alterations permitting a broader acceptance by the creators of other BitTorrent clients.

:As per the specifications ( http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Message_Stream_Encryption ), MSE/PE uses [[w:Diffie-Hellman key exchange|key exchange]] combined with the infohash of the torrent to establish an [[w:RC4|RC4]] encryption key. The key exchange helps to minimize the risk of passive listeners, and the infohash helps avoid [[w:man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle attack]]s. RC4 is chosen for its speed. The first kilobyte of the RC4 output is discarded to prevent a [[w:RC4#Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|particular attack]].

:The specification allows for the users to choose between encrypting the headers only or the full connection. Encrypting the full connection provides more obfuscation but uses more CPU time. To ensure compatibility with other clients that don't support this specification, users may also choose whether unencrypted incoming or outgoing connections are still allowed. Supported clients propagate the fact that they have MSE/PE enabled through [[w:peer exchange|PEX]] and [[w:Distributed hash table|DHT]].

:Analysis of this method has shown that statistical measurements of packet sizes and packet directions of the first 100 packets in a TCP session can be used to identify the obfuscated protocol with over 96% accuracy, this makes this solution only effective against the efforts of ISPs that don't adopt state of the art traffic analysis, mostly smaller ISPs.

Various solutions exist to protect the BitTorrent network against attacks including encrypting both peer-to-tracker and peer-to-peer communication, using Microsoft's [[w:Teredo tunneling|Teredo]] so that TCP connections are tunneled within UDP packets, filtering TCP resets before they reach the TCP layer in the end-host, or switching entirely from a TCP-based transport to a UDP-based transport.  Each solution has its trade-offs.  Filtering out attack TCP resets typically requires kernel access, and the participation of the remote peer since the attacker has to send the reset packet to the local and remote peers. Teredo is not available on all BitTorrent clients.  Rewriting TCP reliability, in-order delivery and congestion control in a new UDP protocol represents a substantial engineering effort and would require upgrading both ends of any peer-to-peer connection.

The frame is the solid part of the bicycle that interconnects the various components.  Frames come in various materials, including steel, aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber.  The most popular types of frame are the double diamond and step through frames.

Frames can become cracked or bent and require repair or replacement.

Steel frames can be readily straightened, other materials can't generally be straightened.  Tools exist for the straightening of frames, or many can be improvised.

Steel frames can be welded, other materials can't generally be welded.

The paint on a frame can become chipped, etc. and need to be repaired.

Sometimes components can become seized in the frame and require removal.

= Cranks =

The term crank set refers to the cranks, or pedal arms, that connect the [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Pedals|pedals]] to the [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Bottom Brackets|bottom bracket]].  The term crankset refers somewhat ambiguously to both cranks and possibly the bottom bracket.

== Types of Cranks ==
Cranks come in various forms.

=== One piece ===
In one piece cranksets, there is a single piece of metal bent into a Z shape that forms both cranks and the [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Bottom Brackets|bottom bracket]] spindle.  These types of cranks are usually found on lower end bikes and BMX bikes.  The bottom bracket shell on one piece cranks is much larger than other for other bottom brackets.

=== Cottered Cranks ===
Cottered cranks are decidedly the older standard, but replacement parts are still available.  Cottered cranks are held with a cotter pin to the bottom bracket spindle.  Common repairs on cotter cranks involve the replacement or refacing of the cotter pins which often become worn over time, leading to slop in the cranks.  For proper alignment the cotter pins on opposite sides of the bicycle must be pointed in opposite directions, otherwise the cranks will not be 180 degrees apart.

=== Cotterless ===
Cotterless cranks come in two main types:

==== Square Taper ====
Square taper cranks have a square taper in the mounting hole.  The crank is held on primarily with friction, and fixed in place with a crank bolt or nut (depending on the type of bottom bracket).

==== Splined ====
Splined cranks use a multi-toothed spline to hold the crank.  These come in various standards including ISIS and Shimano Octalink (V1 and V2).  ISIS is an open standard that has been adopted by various manufacturers in response to the proprietary Shimano standard.

=== Hollowtech II ===
Two piece cranks where the drive side has a shaft bolted on which is then pushed through the frame (and bottom bracket)then non drive side attached.
Bottom brackets for Hollowtech II are external and require a special tool to remove.
Removal of cranks and bottom bracket with Hollowtech II takes around 2 minutes, because of this it does not require much bicycle knowledge.

--[[User:MtbEllis|MtbEllis]] ([[User talk:MtbEllis|talk]]) 12:56, 1 November 2009 (UTC)

== Crank Removal ==
* Cotter pin removal
* Crank bolt/nut removal
* Crank puller
* Hollowtech II removal tool.
*(details need to be completed)

=== Removal of Seized Cranks ===
It is common for cranks to be come seized (by corrosion) to the bottom bracket spindle.  The removal of seized cranks is time intensive and can damage the cranks, the bottom bracket bearings and the frame, so caution is advised.  Household ammonia can be used to dissolve corrosion between aluminum and steel.
(details need to be completed)
If bottom bracket is damaged it will need to be &quot;Faced and Chased&quot; at your local bike shop.

--[[User:MtbEllis|MtbEllis]] ([[User talk:MtbEllis|talk]]) 13:00, 1 November 2009 (UTC)

== Crank Installation ==
While somewhat debatable, grease is generally recommended when installing cranks.  The removal of seized cranks is time intensive and can damage the cranks, the bottom bracket bearings and the frame.

      <comment>/* Prepositions Indicating Time */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
A preposition connects or shows the relationship between a noun, pronoun and phrase to other parts of the sentence. Whatever object or phrase the preposition is introducing is called the object of the preposition. 

Each '''bold''' word in the following sentences are examples of prepositions:

The box is '''on''' the desk.
The box is '''under''' the desk.
The box is leaning '''against''' the desk.
The box is '''beside''' the desk.
He held the box '''over''' the desk.
He looked at the box '''during''' lunch.

In each sentence a preposition is used to locate the box in time or space.
People use prepositions everyday without even realizing it. Think of a preposition as a way to relate the object to the rest of the sentence.
==List of Prepositions==

&lt;/center&gt;
==Object of the Preposition==
The object of the preposition is always a noun, a pronoun or a noun equivalent.
===Examples:===
#'''With poise''', Gwyneth Paltrow walked to the stage and accepted her Academy Award. (The noun '''poise''' is the object of the preposition '''with'''.)
#The Palace welcomed the Prince of Monaco and scheduled a sightseeing tour '''for him.''' (The pronoun '''him''' is the object of the preposition '''for'''.)
# The director asked '''about proposing the summer programs for the University'''. ('''Proposing the summer programs for the University''' is a group of words functioning as noun or is a noun equivalent. It is the object of the preposition '''about'''.)

==Prepositions Indicating Time==
# Use '''on''' before days of the week, before months followed by the day or before the time indicating the day, month and year.
# Use '''in''' to indicate year, before months not followed by the day or before the month and year without the day.
# Use '''for''' to refer to a period of time stating the number of hours, days or weeks.
# Use '''during''' to refer to a period of time.
# Use '''since''' to refer to a period of time from the past to the present.

==Prepositions Indicating Place or Position==
#Use '''between''' when you speak of two persons, places or things.
#Use '''among''' when you speak of three or more persons, places or things.
#Use '''on''' in an address with only the name of the street.
#Use '''at''' when referring to places which indicate the general location.
#Use '''in''' when the given location is more specific.
#Use '''in''' when something is already inside.
#Use '''into''' when there is movement involved in the placement of something.

I found this wikibook and began this chapter to try and get a feel for the ins and outs of wiki authoring.
I would be interested in continuIng to develop this chapter as a continuation of the that experiment and to work with the author(s) of this wikibook towards the goal of making this a truly usable resource.</text>

=Ware Opening - Symmetric Variation=
===1...a5===
:This move is an unusual response to 1. a4, but it is not without merit. If an informed player is playing White, he will not try to develop the rook from a1 to a3 (as ...e5 will prevent it), but will instead wait for a chance to play a5 followed by Ra4. An early 1...a5 by Black prevents this tactic and helps to negate any value of playing 1. a4.

&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H2 CLASS=&quot;Heading2&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;Control engineering has evolved over time. In the past humans were the main method for controlling a system. More recently electricity has been used for control and early electrical control was based on relays. These relays allow power to be switched on and off without a mechanical switch. It is common to use relays to make simple logical control decisions. The development of low cost computer has brought the most recent revolution, the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The advent of the PLC began in the 1970s, and has become the most common choice for manufacturing controls.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;
PLCs have been gaining popularity on the factory floor and will probably remain predominant for some time to come. Most of this is because of the advantages they offer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;#183; Cost effective for controlling complex systems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;#183; Flexible and can be reapplied to control other systems quickly and easily.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;#183; Computational abilities allow more sophisticated control.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;#183; Trouble shooting aids make programming easier and reduce downtime.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;#183; Reliable components make these likely to operate for years before failure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H3 CLASS=&quot;Heading3&quot;&gt;Ladder Logic&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;
Ladder logic is the main programming method used for PLCs. As mentioned before, ladder logic has been developed to mimic relay logic. The decision to use the relay logic diagrams was a strategic one. By selecting ladder logic as the main programming method, the amount of retraining needed for engineers and tradespeople was greatly reduced.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;
Modern control systems still include relays, but these are rarely used for logic. A relay is a simple device that uses a magnetic field to control a switch, as pictured in See Simple Relay Layouts and Schematics. When a voltage is applied to the input coil, the resulting current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field pulls a metal switch (or reed) towards it and the contacts touch, closing the switch. The contact that closes when the coil is energized is called normally open. The normally closed contacts touch when the input coil is not energized. Relays are normally drawn in schematic form using a circle to represent the input coil. The output contacts are shown with two parallel lines. Normally open contacts are shown as two lines, and will be open (non-conducting) when the input is not energized. Normally closed contacts are shown with two lines with a diagonal line through them. When the input coil is not energized the normally closed contacts will be closed (conducting).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-2.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;Simple Relay Layouts and Schematics&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;
Relays are used to let one power source close a switch for another (often high current) power source, while keeping them isolated. An example of a relay in a simple control application is shown in See A Simple Relay Controller. In this system the first relay on the left is used as normally closed, and will allow current to flow until a voltage is applied to the input A. The second relay is normally open and will not allow current to flow until a voltage is applied to the input B. If current is flowing through the first two relays then current will flow through the coil in the third relay, and close the switch for output C. This circuit would normally be drawn in the ladder logic form. This can be read logically as C will be on if A is off and B is on.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-3.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;A Simple Relay Controller&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;The example in See A Simple Relay Controller does not show the entire control system, but only the logic. When we consider a PLC there are inputs, outputs, and the logic. See A PLC Illustrated With Relays shows a more complete representation of the PLC. Here there are two inputs from push buttons. We can imagine the inputs as activating 24V DC relay coils in the PLC. This in turn drives an output relay that switches 115V AC, that will turn on a light. Note, in actual PLCs inputs are never relays, but outputs are often relays. The ladder logic in the PLC is actually a computer program that the user can enter and change. Notice that both of the input push buttons are normally open, but the ladder logic inside the PLC has one normally open contact, and one normally closed contact. Do not think that the ladder logic in the PLC needs to match the inputs or outputs. Many beginners will get caught trying to make the ladder logic match the input types.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-4.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;A PLC Illustrated With Relays&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;Many relays also have multiple outputs (throws) and this allows an output relay to also be an input simultaneously. The circuit shown in See A Seal-in Circuit is an example of this, it is called a seal in circuit. In this circuit the current can flow through either branch of the circuit, through the contacts labelled A or B. The input B will only be on when the output B is on. If B is off, and A is energized, then B will turn on. If B turns on then the input B will turn on, and keep output B on even if input A goes off. After B is turned on the output B will not turn off.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-5.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;A Seal-in Circuit&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H3 CLASS=&quot;Heading3&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;The first PLCs were programmed with a technique that was based on relay logic wiring schematics. This eliminated the need to teach the electricians, technicians and engineers how to program a computer - but, this method has stuck and it is the most common technique for programming PLCs today. An example of ladder logic can be seen in See A Simple Ladder Logic Diagram. To interpret this diagram imagine that the power is on the vertical line on the left hand side, we call this the hot rail. On the right hand side is the neutral rail. In the figure there are two rungs, and on each rung there are combinations of inputs (two vertical lines) and outputs (circles). If the inputs are opened or closed in the right combination the power can flow from the hot rail, through the inputs, to power the outputs, and finally to the neutral rail. An input can come from a sensor, switch, or any other type of sensor. An output will be some device outside the PLC that is switched on or off, such as lights or motors. In the top rung the contacts are normally open and normally closed. Which means if input A is on and input B is off, then power will flow through the output and activate it. Any other combination of input values will result in the output X being off.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;

[[Image:plc_intro-6.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;A Simple Ladder Logic Diagram&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;The second rung of See A Simple Ladder Logic Diagram is more complex, there are actually multiple combinations of inputs that will result in the output Y turning on. On the left most part of the rung, power could flow through the top if C is off and D is on. Power could also (and simultaneously) flow through the bottom if both E and F are true. This would get power half way across the rung, and then if G or H is true the power will be delivered to output Y. In later chapters we will examine how to interpret and construct these diagrams.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;There are other methods for programming PLCs. One of the earliest techniques involved mnemonic instructions. These instructions can be derived directly from the ladder logic diagrams and entered into the PLC through a simple programming terminal. An example of mnemonics is shown in See An Example of a Mnemonic Program and Equivalent Ladder Logic. In this example the instructions are read one line at a time from top to bottom. The first line 00000 has the instruction LDN (input load and not) for input A. This will examine the input to the PLC and if it is off it will remember a 1 (or true), if it is on it will remember a 0 (or false). The next line uses an LD (input load) statement to look at the input. If the input is off it remembers a 0, if the input is on it remembers a 1 (note: this is the reverse of the LD). The AND statement recalls the last two numbers remembered and if the are both true the result is a 1, otherwise the result is a 0. This result now replaces the two numbers that were recalled, and there is only one number remembered. The process is repeated for lines 00003 and 00004, but when these are done there are now three numbers remembered. The oldest number is from the AND, the newer numbers are from the two LD instructions. The AND in line 00005 combines the results from the last LD instructions and now there are two numbers remembered. The OR instruction takes the two numbers now remaining and if either one is a 1 the result is a 1, otherwise the result is a 0. This result replaces the two numbers, and there is now a single number there. The last instruction is the ST (store output) that will look at the last value stored and if it is 1, the output will be turned on, if it is 0 the output will be turned off.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;An Example of a Mnemonic Program and Equivalent Ladder Logic&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;The ladder logic program in See An Example of a Mnemonic Program and Equivalent Ladder Logic, is equivalent to the mnemonic program. Even if you have programmed a PLC with ladder logic, it will be converted to mnemonic form before being used by the PLC. In the past mnemonic programming was the most common, but now it is uncommon for users to even see mnemonic programs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) have been developed to accommodate the programming of more advanced systems. These are similar to flowcharts, but much more powerful. The example seen in See An Example of a Sequential Function Chart is doing two different things. To read the chart, start at the top where is says start. Below this there is the double horizontal line that says follow both paths. As a result the PLC will start to follow the branch on the left and right hand sides separately and simultaneously. On the left there are two functions the first one is the power up function. This function will run until it decides it is done, and the power down function will come after. On the right hand side is the flash function, this will run until it is done. These functions look unexplained, but each function, such as power up will be a small ladder logic program. This method is much different from flowcharts because it does not have to follow a single path through the flowchart.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-8.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;An Example of a Sequential Function Chart&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;Structured Text programming has been developed as a more modern programming language. It is quite similar to languages such as BASIC. A simple example is shown in See An Example of a Structured Text Program. This example uses a PLC memory location i. This memory location is for an integer, as will be explained later in the book. The first line of the program sets the value to 0. The next line begins a loop, and will be where the loop returns to. The next line recalls the value in location i, adds 1 to it and returns it to the same location. The next line checks to see if the loop should quit. If i is greater than or equal to 10, then the loop will quit, otherwise the computer will go back up to the REPEAT statement continue from there. Each time the program goes through this loop i will increase by 1 until the value reaches 10.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;i := 0;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;REPEAT&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;i := i + 1;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;UNTIL i &gt;= 10&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;END_REPEAT;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H3 CLASS=&quot;Heading3&quot;&gt;PLC Connections&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;When a process is controlled by a PLC it uses inputs from sensors to make decisions and update outputs to drive actuators, as shown in See The Separation of Controller and Process. The process is a real process that will change over time. Actuators will drive the system to new states (or modes of operation). This means that the controller is limited by the sensors available, if an input is not available, the controller will have no way to detect a condition.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-10.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H6 CLASS=&quot;Fig&quot;&gt;The Separation of Controller and Process&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;The control loop is a continuous cycle of the PLC reading inputs, solving the ladder logic, and then changing the outputs. Like any computer this does not happen instantly. See The Scan Cycle of a PLC shows the basic operation cycle of a PLC. When power is turned on initially the PLC does a quick sanity check to ensure that the hardware is working properly. If there is a problem the PLC will halt and indicate there is an error. For example, if the PLC power is dropping and about to go off this will result in one type of fault. If the PLC passes the sanity check it will then scan (read) all the inputs. After the inputs values are stored in memory the ladder logic will be scanned (solved) using the stored values - not the current values. This is done to prevent logic problems when inputs change during the ladder logic scan. When the ladder logic scan is complete the outputs will be scanned (the output values will be changed). After this the system goes back to do a sanity check, and the loop continues indefinitely. Unlike normal computers, the entire program will be run every scan. Typical times for each of the stages is in the order of milliseconds.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H3 CLASS=&quot;Heading3&quot;&gt;Ladder Logic Inputs&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;PLC inputs are easily represented in ladder logic. In See Ladder Logic Inputs there are three types of inputs shown. The first two are normally open and normally closed inputs, discussed previously. The IIT (Immediate InpuT) function allows inputs to be read after the input scan, while the ladder logic is being scanned. This allows ladder logic to examine input values more often than once every cycle. (Note: This instruction is not available on the ControlLogix processors, but is still available on older models.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H3 CLASS=&quot;Heading3&quot;&gt;Ladder Logic Outputs&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;In ladder logic there are multiple types of outputs, but these are not consistently available on all PLCs. Some of the outputs will be externally connected to devices outside the PLC, but it is also possible to use internal memory locations in the PLC. Six types of outputs are shown in See Ladder Logic Outputs. The first is a normal output, when energized the output will turn on, and energize an output. The circle with a diagonal line through is a normally on output. When energized the output will turn off. This type of output is not available on all PLC types. When initially energized the OSR (One Shot Relay) instruction will turn on for one scan, but then be off for all scans after, until it is turned off. The L (latch) and U (unlatch) instructions can be used to lock outputs on. When an L output is energized the output will turn on indefinitely, even when the output coil is deenergized. The output can only be turned off using a U output. The last instruction is the IOT (Immediate OutpuT) that will allow outputs to be updated without having to wait for the ladder logic scan to be completed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P CLASS=&quot;point&quot;&gt;&amp;#183; There are multiple ways to write a PLC program.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H2 CLASS=&quot;Heading2&quot;&gt;PRACTICE PROBLEMS&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;1. Give an example of where a PLC could be used.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;2. Why would relays be used in place of PLCs?&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;4. List the advantages of a PLC over relays.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;5. A PLC can effectively replace a number of components. Give examples and discuss some good and bad applications of PLCs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;6. Explain why ladder logic outputs are coils?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;7. In the figure below, will the power for the output on the first rung normally be on or off? Would the output on the second rung normally be on or off?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;

&lt;DIV&gt;
[[Image:plc_intro-17.svg]]
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H2 CLASS=&quot;Heading2&quot;&gt;PRACTICE PROBLEM SOLUTIONS&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;1. To control a conveyor system&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;2. For simple designs&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;3. A PLC is a computer based controller that uses inputs to monitor a process, and uses outputs to control a process using a program.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;4. Less expensive for complex processes, debugging tools, reliable, flexible, easy to expand, etc.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;5. A PLC could replace a few relays. In this case the relays might be easier to install and less expensive. To control a more complex system the controller might need timing, counting and other mathematical calculations. In this case a PLC would be a better choice.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;6. The ladder logic outputs were modeled on relay logic diagrams. The output in a relay ladder diagram is a relay coil that switches a set of output contacts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;7. off, on&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;
&lt;H2 CLASS=&quot;Heading2&quot;&gt;ASSIGNMENT PROBLEMS&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;1. Explain the trade-offs between relays and PLCs for control applications.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P CLASS=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;2. Develop a simple ladder logic program that will turn on an output X if inputs A and B, or input C is on.&lt;/P&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Telecommunication ==
===Public Switch Telephone Network===

The Public Switched Telephone Network, or PSTN, is the worldwide network of lines used to carry telephone calls. It is a &quot;switched&quot; network because a connection is made between caller and receiver before any communication begins. Originally, a physical circuit (formed via a number of switches) had to be formed between the caller and receiver, limiting the capacity of the network. This problem was resolved with the development of time division multiplexing.

The first telephone exchanges (where the circuit switches were located) were operated manually by the telephone operator. This was a slow process. Over time, the human operators were replaced with electromechanical switches. These were in turn superseded by electronic switches.

The telephone network can be visualised as a &quot;hub and spokes&quot; arrangement. When the call is made, if it is local to the exchange, then the signal is carried along a spoke to the local exchange (i.e., the hub) then routed down another spoke to the receiver. If the call is a &quot;trunk&quot; call (i.e., not local to the exchange) then the local exchange routes the call to the trunk exchange for onward delivery to the exchange local to the receiver. For international calls, the local exchange will route to an international gateway.

===Mobile Phone=== 
A mobile phone is a handset consisting of a radio transmitter and receiver. A number of different frequencies and encoding techniques are used (hence the need for dual, tri and quad band phones if worldwide usage is required). The handset is constantly in touch with the nearest base station via a low power signal. When a call is made or received, the handset establishes stronger radio wave link with the nearby base station. Each base station is linked to the cellular exchange by a communication cable. The cellular exchange allows entry to the PSTN.

The increasing use of mobile phones does not make it possible for each mobile phone to have its own carrier frequency as the range of carrier frequencies for linking between mobile phones and base stations is limited. Hence the same carrier frequency must be used by many mobile phones at the same time (repeated cells). This is done using UHF which has a limited terrestrial range and using low power transmitters. Each base station has an omnidirectional antenna and the transmitted radio wave are powered so as to have a range approximately equal to the radius of the cell (a few Km) The advantage of operating on UHF is that the aerial of the mobile phone will be very short. Neighbouring cells will typically use different range of carrier frequencies so as to prevent interference.

== Hello! ==

Hello Hugh jack, welcome to Wikibooks. I saw your new book, and am very interested to see how it progresses. I'm an EE myself (a soon-to-graduate student, anyway), and am pretty familiar with this area. I've started (although often have not finished) several books in this area, such as [[Programmable Logic]], [[Digital Circuits]], and [[Embedded Systems]]. I also helped out with a class project on [[Embedded Control Systems Design]], which is similar. I would really like to see how your book turns out, and I would be willing to help upload it if you need assistance with that. Welcome to Wikibooks! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:46, 16 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm pretty sure the answer to question 6 is wrong. The graph shows the car's velocity as always positive which obviously can't be true if it moves away from a point and then returns to it the velocity must be negative at some point. (perhaps the author forgot that velocity is a vector quantity?).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:TopLink|TopLink Essentials]] is an open source project from the Sun java.net Glassfish community.  It is the EJB3 JPA 1.0 reference implementation, and is the JPA provider for the Sun Glassfish v1 application server.

TopLink Essentials was based on the [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] product, which [[w:Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] contributed some of the source code from to create the TopLink Essentials project.  The original contribution was from TopLink's 10.1.3 code base, only some of the TopLink product source code was contributed, which did not include some key enterprise features.  The package names were changed and some of the code was moved around.

TopLink Essentials has been replaced by the [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] project.  EclipseLink will be the JPA 2.0 reference implementation and be part of Sun Glassfish v3.

This work will primarily cover the techniques commonly referred to as hypnosis. It will also offer support material, or reference it, such as methods to induce, or reinforce specific [[w:Philosophy of mind|mental states]] (or states of mind) and any attitudes and beliefs that impact the phenomena. Including information on techniques or procedures for hypnotic induction and hypnotic suggestion.

Hypnotic suggestions are commonly composed of a series of instructions and ideas that may be delivered by a hypnotist in the presence of the subject, or they may be self-administered ([[w:Autosuggestion|&quot;self-suggestion&quot; or &quot;autosuggestion&quot;]]), even in a conscious state.

Hypnosis is not a science. In fact, it has in almost every aspect eluded scientific analysis, as it is extremely hard to generalize (each individual responds differently and at different levels) and the methodology is so diverse and based on yet to be completely understood mental/biological phenomena, most related with faith or the placebo effect. For the phenomena to work, whom in aggregate we define as hypnosis, the mind has to be able to turn the suggestions into reality. All hypnosis is ultimately self hypnosis. If you, for instance, take into consideration the problems that faith beliefs have caused to the human race, or even the problems in the field of psychology, you can appreciate the problem of scientifically studying hypnotic phenomena, as they are extremely open to individual interpretation and to one's ability to be open to suggestibility (self-induced or otherwise).

      <comment>[[Talk:First Aid/Sprains, Strains &amp; Dislocations]] moved to [[Talk:First Aid/Musculoskeletal Injuries]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Regarding [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mike.lifeguard&amp;oldid=1165680#Forgot this] and [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/22_suppl/III-115 this], it seems a merge from [[First Aid/Fractures]] to here is in order, along with a rename. How does [[First Aid/Musculoskeletal Injuries]] sound for this page, and [[First Aid/Immobilization]] for the other? I dislike the idea of dealing with fractures and the &quot;lesser&quot; injuries simultaneously, but it seems they really do want the same treatment for everything.

Nugger already supports this, so if there are no objections, I'll history merge, move and fix redirects in a week. I'll restore all or most of Nugger's edit now. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:59, 15 April 2008 (UTC)
:I would think that this is a better way of looking at things, it simplifies looking up information for injuries that present with almost the exact same symptoms. For example, sprain vs. fracture, both can present with swelling, bruising, extreme pain etc. As said before, the only definitive way to tell if an injury includes a fracture is by x-ray. With that said, having a separate section for immobilization with splinting will tidy up the pages. (Splinting can be done for any Musculoskeletal injury, so having it only under fractures at this time would not be correct.) --[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] ([[User talk:Nugger|talk]]) 19:08, 15 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.67}}


==Remove the default cube==
[[File:Blender267DefaultCube.png|right|150px]]

When you first open blender you will see the default Blender user interface (UI) layout and the default cube.

Delete the cube by selecting it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and then pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}}. 

{{Clear}}

==Add a cylinder==
[[File:Blender267CylinderEditMode.png|right|150px]]
Switch to '''Side''' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}).

Add a Cylinder with {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}}→ Add→ Mesh→ Cylinder. At the bottom of the Tool Shelf change “Cap Fill Type” to “Triangle Fan”.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to switch to Edit mode. The cylinder should now look like the picture at right.

{{Clear}}

==Remove the bottom row of vertices==

[[File:Blender267ParachuteDeleteCylinderBottom.png|right|500px]]
Next you will want to delete the bottom row of vertices. To accomplish this go into side view by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}.

Ensure that you are in '''Vertex select''' mode (that the leftmost of the group of 3 icons [[File:Blender-edit-select-modes.png]] is selected; click on it if not). 

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} twice to deselect everything.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|BKEY}}, and box select the bottom row of vertices, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} to delete and then confirm. 

Note: you must have limit selection to visible off, the button to the right of the group of three icons for selection. If you wish to do the selection with it ON, you will have to change your perspective so as to be able to select all lower vertices.

{{Clear}}

==Extrude and scale to shape==
[[Image:Blender3d Parachute select outer edges.jpg|right|150px]]

Be in '''Vertex-select mode''' (as above).

Select all the vertices around the outside of the circle. The centre vertex must not be selected. You can do this conveniently in a number of ways; why not practise them all:
* Starting with no vertices selected, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} to select all vertices, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|RMB}} on the centre vertex to deselect it. Or
* Starting with no vertices selected, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|SHIFT|RMB}} (''loop select'') on one of the outside edges or vertices to select the entire loop of them. Or
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the centre vertex to select only it, then use {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|I}} to invert the selection.

Now switch to edge-select mode by {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|TAB}} and selecting Edges.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blender_Cylinder_Taper_For_Parachute.jpg|right|150px]]

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}} to extrude (&quot;region&quot;) the selection and {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} to constrain to the Z axis. 

Drag the edges a small ways down then click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to release. 

As this makes a right-angle at the sides and parachutes to don’t have straight edges, we need to scale the selection outward. 

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} and move the mouse away from the model, you will see that the edges get smaller and bigger. 

Scale them out a small ways then left click to release. You will want to practice a little with the scale amounts till you can make a realistic parachute shape. 

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender_Screen_Parachute_shaped_Mesh.jpg|right|150px]]
Continue extruding and scaling till you have a shape like the one shown on the right.

When you're done making a nice shape, be sure to select all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} twice), then {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and pick “Remove Doubles”.

{{Clear}}

==Make the top more rounded==
[[image:Blender3d Parachute move center vertex up.jpg|150px|right]]
Be in '''Vertex mode'''.

Select the center vertex in the middle of the original top half of the cylinder, use circle select to get it, otherise you will be {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} a number of times to find it, and move {{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}} it up along the {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} axis.

Select all {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}}, and then {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and Remove Doubles, in case any were created.

{{Clear}}

==Extrude the parachute straps==
[[Image:Blender_Select_Corners_OnCylinder.jpg|right|150px]]
Now go into top-view by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}. Here you will select ~4 edges at opposite sides of each other.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blender_Pull_Corners_Down.jpg|right|150px]]
Go back into side-view {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}} and extrude downward by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}} and then {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}}. 

{{Clear}}

==Merge it together==
[[Image:Blender_Completed_Parachute.jpg|right|151px]]
All that remains to finish your parachute is to press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|MKEY}} then choose “At Center” which will merge all selected vertices.

A alternate way to make the parachute top is to create a UV sphere, and cut it in half.

      <comment>Add 3 clarifications</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I tried to translate this page into Japanese and found 3 clarification points.

* warning and/or error?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compiler issues a warning here because the copy-constructor of yptr is not really a copy-constructor but in fact it is a move constructor, which takes a non-const reference to an auto_ptr, as given in Move Constructor idiom. A non-const reference can't bind with a const variable and therefore, compiler flags an error.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'm confused when reading these sentences. Do the 2 sentences say the same thing or different things?
According to my understandings, this produces compilation error. 

* a const RHS as a parameter

&lt;blockquote&gt;An undesirable consequence of const auto_ptr idiom is that compiler can't provide a default copy-constructor to a class that has a const auto_ptr member in it. This is because the compiler generated copy-constructor always takes a const RHS as a parameter, which can't bind with a non-const move constructor of auto_ptr.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Does &quot;a const RHS as a parameter&quot; mean x.xptr in the below code?

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class X
{
    const auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; xptr;
};

// Pseudo code of compiler generated copy constructor
X::X(X&amp; x) // non-const reference because auto_ptr has non-const copy constructor
  : xptr(x.xptr) // error due to const-ness of x.xptr
{}
&lt;/source&gt;

* Intention of solutions

The subsequent sentence said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The solution is to use Virtual Constructor idiom or use boost::scoped_ptr, which explicitly prohibits copying by denying access to assignment and copy-constructor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By using Virtual Constructor, a class that has a const auto_ptr member in it becomes copyable. However, explicitly defined copy constructor also makes the class copyable, doesn't it?

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class X
{
    const auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; xptr;
    X(const X&amp; xp):xptr(new int(*xp.xptr)) {}
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Furthermore, as described, boost::scoped_ptr explicitly prohibits copy and assignment. Threfore, the situation that the class is not copyable is not changed. Does the sentence mean using boost::scoped_ptr make the intention of prohibition of copy and assignment clearer?

I have a collection of SQL exercises written over a number of years that I want to publish as a Wikibook. I started writing the [[SQL Exercises]] Wikibook on 03/15/08, and I hope it will include a useful amount of exercises by late April or late May.

==1. Describe the national, state or provincial, AY, Pathfinder, and Christian flags.==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
|'''National Flag:''' Description of national flag
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials,   cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]
|-
|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations.  The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]
|}

===Current state/provincial flags===
&lt;!-- Find images of all the provincial flags of your country and put them here.  --&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;




&lt;/gallery&gt;

==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: &lt;br&gt;a. Camp out/camporee &lt;br&gt;b. Fair &lt;br&gt;c. Pathfinder Day program &lt;br&gt;d. Parade==

==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed. ==
===Folding===

===Flag Protocol===

==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==

==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==

===Rights===

===Responsibilities===

==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

Note that just because the requirement suggests that the famous person should be male (''his'' recognition), the Pathfinder should in no way feel constrained to limit the selection to just men.

==8. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===

===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===

===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===

==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==

==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==

==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

What would you expect the value of ''z'' to be?

=Crab Variation=
This move does nothing to aid development and weakens White. This is not recommended theory and is named due to its crab-like appearance.

= Pickering Defence =
===1...h5===
This defense is considered a very weak response to the King's Pawn Opening, and is usually considered even worse than the Corn Stalk Defense, as not only does it not open any lines for development and allow White quick and easy development, it additionally weakens Black's king position slightly. Note the development of the rook to h6 can easily be prevented by 2. d4.

= Barnes Defence =
===1...f6?===
The Barnes Defence is considered a very poor move, as it opens no lines for Black to develop his pieces, allows White free and easy development, deprives the g8 knight of its most natural square (f6), and weakens the position of the black king. It does attack a central square, e5, but 1...d6, or even 1... Nc6 are better moves to attack this square. Alternatively, 1...e5, occupying the square immediately, is considered one of Black's most reliable moves. Barnes Defense is named after Thomas Wilson Barnes, an English master who, amazingly, defeated one of the greatest players of the time, Paul Morphy, with it in an offhand game played in London in July 1858.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book title is already taken by a much better and still relevant text.

== Sway or General Programming ==
I think this book is wrongly titled. I know that it is just now coming to life but for most of the content I've looked into it addresses more the Sway programming language than the topic the title suggests.&lt;br&gt;
One could argue that Sway may be a good choice as any to introduce the topic, but I don't see how using a &quot;obscure&quot; language is in any way better than using the standard approach and give classic examples of the programming paradigms with a multitude of references to existing and well known languages, for most part pseudocode would suffice and make it easier for a non programmer to understand the content and examples, without being side tracked in introducing a single language.&lt;br&gt;
In my opinion the book as it is should be transformed in a introduction/complete manual to Sway programming, and this generalist title dropped as it is somewhat misleading.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:54, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

: I don't see how this title is any more &quot;wrong&quot; than the title of the hardback book &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot;, by Allen B. Downey et al, which is apparently a sneaky way to get people to learn Python. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:06, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

::There are several versions of that book for other languages (not only Python) the complete title is &quot;Python for Software Design: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot; or [http://www.amazon.com/How-Think-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/0971677506 &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python&quot;] I think it depends on the edition.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:43, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

::: OK, so how about we agree that this book has the complete title &quot;The Science of Programming: with the Sway programming language&quot;?
::: Can we verbally agree that is the complete name and post it prominately on this page, and still use the short name &quot;The Science of Programming&quot; as the name for [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] page naming purposes, leaving off the subtitle? I hear that [[mw:Extension:AllBooks]] has a recommendation for how to handle books with subtitles. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 00:43, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

::::&quot;We&quot; don't &quot;need&quot; to agree with anything, I haven't renamed the book, I'm not an editor of it nor am I championing a name change. I was merely pointing out (I noticed the work when I was tinkering with the categories) that the title raises several issues a) too broad  b) uses exclusively a generally unknown language (not even on Wikipedia, not that it should be a requirement) and recently c) the author (the editor that contributed most of the content) blanked the toc page pointing to a new location (change that was reverted by myself), but the author hasn't posted an announcement as I indicated as the optimal solution so I see the future evolution of the work as being at risk.
::::Disregarding c) we are left with points a) and b) that on my view reduce the usefulness of the work, mostly because of the  expectations the general title implies. I would never the less prefer a new title, your proposal seems reasonable and more clear, even if we could and should comply with the normal use of names/namespaces of the project (this is not an attempt to rehash your stated  dislike to the status quo on that topic) but placing it in a Sway namespace would be optimal if the colons are to be used, as in Sway:The Science of Programming (but creating a namespace for only a book on the language doesn't seem useful), so a better alternative would be Sway, the Science of Programming or Sway - The Science of Programming, something on those lines. If you do intend in making a point on the use of colon you should raise the issue on the discussion about book names/namespaces, if not you will probably be creating even more confusion on the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:18, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

::::: Panic, I appreciate that you were the first one to use and mention the colon on this talk page, and the first one to mention a book name with a colon in it. Thank you.
::::: Since you brought up &quot;need&quot;, I agree that you don't &quot;need&quot; to agree with me.
::::: I'm going to pretend that you agree with me and Downey's publishers that &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot; is an adequate short name for Downey's book.
::::: I'm going to pretend that you agree with me that the colon-free short name &quot;The Science of Programming&quot; is an adequate short name for this book, and we can continue using that for page names, at least until we have some other wikibook that actually does cover all of programming as a science.
::::: I agree that -- much like Downey's book -- &quot;The Science of Programming&quot; sounds like it covers more than this really does, and so I think the first page of this book should be very, very clear on what this book actually does cover. Perhaps this first page should directly link to other wikibooks that talk more about programming in general, as a science. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:42, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

:::::: You are equating agreement with non-obstruction :), not the same but with the same result (I take this issue very seriously and that was also the point I was making above when referring to the need for agreement), since there is a generalized confusion on the issue when referring to consensus and consensus decisions on this project. In any case I'm not blocking the present solution and was only proposing an alternative to the utilization of the colon convention, so to make it clearer, hence the proposals as &quot;a better alternative would be Sway, the Science of Programming or Sway - The Science of Programming&quot;... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:03, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Exercises ==
Select all warehouses.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 SELECT * 
   FROM Warehouses;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Select all boxes with a value larger than $150.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 SELECT * 
   FROM Boxes 
  WHERE Value &gt; 150;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Select all distinct contents in all the boxes.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 SELECT DISTINCT Contents 
   FROM Boxes;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Select the average value of all the boxes.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 SELECT AVG(Value) 
   FROM Boxes;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Select the warehouse code and the average value of the boxes in each warehouse.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
  SELECT Warehouse, AVG(Value)
    FROM Boxes
GROUP BY Warehouse;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Same as previous exercise, but select only those warehouses where the average value of the boxes is greater than 150.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
  SELECT Warehouse, AVG(Value)
    FROM Boxes
GROUP BY Warehouse
  HAVING AVG(Value) &gt; 150;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Select the code of each box, along with the name of the city the box is located in.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
    SELECT Boxes.Code, Location
      FROM Warehouses 
INNER JOIN Boxes ON Warehouses.Code = Boxes.Warehouse;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Select the warehouse codes, along with the number of boxes in each warehouse. Optionally, take into account that some warehouses are empty (i.e., the box count should show up as zero, instead of omitting the warehouse from the result).

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 /* Not taking into account empty warehouses */
 SELECT Warehouse, COUNT(*)
   FROM Boxes
   GROUP BY Warehouse;

 /* Taking into account empty warehouses */
 SELECT Warehouses.Code, COUNT(Boxes.Code)
   FROM Warehouses LEFT JOIN Boxes
   ON Warehouses.Code = Boxes.Warehouse
   GROUP BY Warehouses.Code;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Select the codes of all warehouses that are saturated (a warehouse is saturated if the number of boxes in it is larger than the warehouse's capacity).

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 SELECT Code
   FROM Warehouses
   WHERE Capacity &lt;
   (
     SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM Boxes
       WHERE Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
   );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Select the codes of all the boxes located in Chicago.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 /* Without subqueries */
 SELECT Boxes.Code
   FROM Warehouses LEFT JOIN Boxes
   ON Warehouses.Code = Boxes.Warehouse
   WHERE Location = 'Chicago';

 /* With a subquery */
 SELECT Code
   FROM Boxes
   WHERE Warehouse IN
   (
     SELECT Code
       FROM Warehouses
       WHERE Location = 'Chicago'
   );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Create a new warehouse in New York with a capacity for 3 boxes.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 INSERT 
   INTO Warehouses
        (Location,Capacity)
 VALUES ('New York',3);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Create a new box, with code &quot;H5RT&quot;, containing &quot;Papers&quot; with a value of $200, and located in warehouse 2.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 INSERT INTO Boxes
   VALUES('H5RT','Papers',200,2);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Reduce the value of all boxes by 15%.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 UPDATE Boxes SET Value = Value * 0.85;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Apply a 20% value reduction to boxes with a value larger than the average value of all the boxes.

  this solution doesn't work with mysql 5.0.67
  ERROR 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'Boxes' for update in FROM clause
  
 
{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 UPDATE Boxes SET Value = Value * 0.80
   WHERE Value &gt; (SELECT AVG(Value) FROM (SELECT * FROM Boxes) AS X);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Remove all boxes with a value lower than $100.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 DELETE FROM Boxes WHERE Value &lt; 100;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Remove all boxes from saturated warehouses.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 DELETE FROM Boxes WHERE Warehouse IN
   (
     SELECT Code
       FROM Warehouses
       WHERE Capacity &lt;
       (
         SELECT COUNT(*)
           FROM Boxes
           WHERE Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
       )
   );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

=Albin Countergambit=
===2...e5===
The Albin Countergambit is an uncommon defense to the Queen's Gambit. Although it is rarely played by masters, it seems to be better than its reputation.

The usual continuation is 3.dxe5 d4, where in exchange for the gambit pawn Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. Often White will try to return the pawn at an appropriate moment in order to gain a positional advantage.

The Black pawn at d4 is stronger than it may appear. The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunder — 6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+ and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion as early as move 7.

Instead the game usually continues 4.Nf3 Nc6 (4...c5 allows 5.e3 because Black no longer has the bishop check) and now White's primary options are 5.a3, 5.Nbd2, and 5.g3. Perhaps White's surest try for an advantage is to fianchetto his king bishop with 5.g3 followed by Bg2 and Nbd2. Black will often castle queenside. A typical continuation is 5.g3 Be6 6.Nbd2 Qd7 7.Bg2 0-0-0 8.0-0 Bh3.

In the Spassky Variation, White plays 4.e4 to take advantage of the fact that an en passant capture must be made immediately after the enemy pawn moves. Now after 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 the en passant capture ...dxe3 is no longer available for Black because of the intervening moves.

=Queen's Boungcloud=
===2. Kd2===
2. Kd2 is thought to be the worst following move to 1. d4 d5. The problems with 2. Kd2? are that the King move prevents castling to protect the King, endangers the King, and ignores development. Unlike the normal Boungcloud Attack, this move has no redeeming qualities or potential whatsoever and is an obvious error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Haggadah (IPA: [həˈgɑdə]) (Hebrew: הגדה) contains the order of the Passover Seder held at home on the first night (and, outside Israel, also on the second night) of Passover. Haggadah, meaning &quot;telling,&quot; is a fulfillment of the scriptural commandment to each Jew to &quot;tell your son&quot; about the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, as described in the book of Exodus in the Torah.  This wikibook is an English version of the Haggadah to assist in performing a Passover seder at home.

=Parham Attack=
===2...Nc6===
A logical move defending the e5 pawn. Black knight could later move to d4 and threaten Nxc2+ and Nxa1, however Black can't be too hasty as White's Queen is aggressively placed.

White has only one sensible move of [[/3. Bc4|3. Bc4]] in view of Black's potentially in playing Nf6 to nudge the Queen away. However in the exhibition game with tennis player Boris Becker vs Garry Kasparov, Becker played [[/3. Qf3|3. Qf3]], a move then Kasparov showed led to the better position for Black.

=Parham Attack=
===3. Bc4===
With this aggressive move, White now threatens checkmate called &quot;Scholar's Mate&quot; by taking the pawn on f7 with the queen. Black has some ways to adequately prevent this mate from happening. The two decent replies are [[/3..g6|3...g6]] and [[/3..Qe7|3...Qe7]]. Kasparov chose [[/3..Qe7|Qe7]] when he met this position in a game against the actor Woody Harrelson in a consultation game.

=Parham Attack=
===3... Nf6??===
White was playing for the 'Scholar's Mate' and Black has overlooked it. This normal looking developing move 3...Nf6 allows the final blow 4. Qxf7. This position is known as 'Scholar's Mate' and is not uncommonly attempted among beginners.

==Theory table==
'''1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6'''

White only requires one move here 4. [[/4. Qxf7|Qxf7#]]

==Parham Attack/Scholar's Mate==
===4. Qxf7#===
With this move White gives checkmate, the Black King cannot take the White queen because the White Bishop on c4 can could take back and moving the Black King to e7(Ke7) still leaves the King in check. So this position is checkmate, and White has won the game.

The position remains symmetrical.  This does not work well for Black as White's move d4 can always be played first.

This book will become a general database of known card games.  Each card game should be placed in the proper section and should have a full set of rules to accompany it on its own article page.  The goal of this book is to generate the most comprehensive card game library ever created.  This will require a lot of help from the community.

Card games listed here do not need to be official in any way.  If you have a great card game that you can accurately recite the rules for, please by all means create a page and document it!  The same goes for if you find that a game is '''not''' listed here, please either add a note in the discussion or create the page yourself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vegas Rummy''' is a variation of the card game Rummy.  Vegas Rummy differs from other versions of Rummy in that it incorporates a betting system and improves upon haste of individual rounds.  Vegas Rummy incorporates some of the similar features of all Rummy variants, most notably including melds.  Vegas Rummy is a game that was slowly developed over the course of about one year.  The goal of creating this variation of Rummy was to introduce a system of betting into Rummy.

==General Method of Play==
Vegas Rummy can be played by any number of players, providing of course that there are at least two players.  It is much more desirable to play with more players as the game becomes much more interesting to play.  Vegas Rummy is played in rounds.  Each game consists of at least one round, and although it is entirely possible for a game to last only a single round, it remains very unlikely.  Each round begins with a shuffle and deal, and ends with the scoring of the round.  The game ends once all players have reached or exceeded the maximum allowed points except for one player, namely the player who won the final round.  All players start with a score of zero, and the maxium score defaults to 100 points.  Player handicapping may occur by setting certain players' starting scores at a positive value.  Game length can be changed by setting a lower score (shorter game) or higher score (longer game).

===Setting Up the Game===
Before the game can being, all players must agree upon some details.
* The value of a buy in
** This is how much each player must pay to start playing, and to continue playing after having expired.  This can be zero for a friendly game.
* The maximum score
** This will determine how long the game will take to complete
* Player handicaps
** If some players are exceptionally good at Vegas Rummy, then they may handicap themselves to provide an advantage to other players
* Cards per player
** This will determine how long rounds will take to complete
* Meld Solidarity
** Without meld solidarity, wild cards may be swapped out of melds for their actual card, making rounds much faster
* Pot Split
** This will determin who wins what amount of money at the end of a game
* Meld Strictness
** If a longer round is desired, melds may only contain a single wild card.  Otherwise melds may contain any number of wild cards.

===The Deck===
Since Vegas Rummy allows for any number of players, a single deck may often not be enough to satisfy the entire group of players.  For this reason multiple decks must be used in situations where a single deck is not satisfactory.  The following is a general guide for how many decks to use:

* 2 - 4 Players: 1 Deck
* 5 - 8 Players: 2 Decks
...
* # of Decks = RoundUp &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\left(5 + m\right)n}{54}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
** m is the number cards per player (default is 7)
** n is the number of players per game

This formula accounts for each player in the game to be able to play at least 5 rounds before a reshuffle is necessary.  This formula is a guideline and as long as all players agree upon how many decks should be used, there is no strict ruling on the number of decks required for a certain number of players, excluding of course not enough cards in total to deal out to the players.

Vegas Rummy makes use of the Jokers in a deck of cards.  There should be two jokers in the deck, if there are more, you must remove the additional jokers.  Jokers are considered a wild card and therefore can be equal to any other card in the deck (other than the other joker of course).  Aces are considered High or Low (the player's choice).

====Hands====
Each player has a number of cards after a deal.  This number should be 7 by the rules, but an alternative number may be used if it is agreed upon by all players.  Lower numbers will mean faster rounds, higher numbers will mean longer rounds.

====Piles====
After the deal, there will be two piles.  The draw pile is always face down, the discard pile is always face up.  The draw pile contains new cards not yet used since the last shuffle.  The discard pile contains cards that have been previously picked up or dealt.

===Choosing the Score Keeper===
The score keeper simply tracks each players' score.  The score keeper does not have to be a player in the game, but often is.  The score keeper can be decided upon by the players of the game.  There is no advantage to being the score keeper.  The score keeper requires a pad of paper and a pen or pencil.

====The Score Sheet====
The score sheet is divided into columns, one column for each player, with each player's name at the top.

===Choosing the First Dealer===
After having shuffled the deck, one player deals out one card to each player face up.  The player with the highest card is designated as the first dealer.  If two or more players have the same ranked highest card, then, without gathering any cards, a second round of choosing the first dealer begins containing only those select players.  This process continues until a single player emerges as the first dealer.  If by some chance the deck runs out of cards when choosing the first dealer, all cards must be collected, reshuffled, and the process begun again.

After a dealer has been chosen, the first round starts.  Players continue to play rounds until the game has finished.

===The Round===
Each round is composed of a deal, several turns, and finally scoring.

====The Deal====
After having shuffled the deck, the dealer deals a single card face down to each player, including himself, until each player has 7 cards, including himself.  Players may look at there hand as it is dealt.  Once each player has their 7 cards, the dealer places the remainder of the deck face down in the middle of the table and flips the top card over placing it face up beside the remainder of the deck.  This card is the designated wild card for the remainder of the round.  If the wild card turns out to be a joker, then the only one wild cards for the round are the jokers.

After the deal is complete, the player to the dealer's left may start his or her turn.

====Turns====
A turn is a players opportunity to play his hand.  A turn '''always''' begins with drawing a card, and '''always''' ends with discarding a card.  A player may either choose to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.  '''It should be noted that the player who plays first in a round may not pick up the card from the discard pile.'''  Once a player has drawn a card, he or she may choose to create or add to a '''meld.'''  The player is not required to do anything other than the mandatory draw and discard.  The card that the player chooses to discard must be placed face up at the top of the discard pile.

====Melds====
A meld is a grouping of 3 or more cards such that one of the following is true
# All cards are of the same rank and different suit
# All cards are of the same suite and in sequential order

When playing with multiple decks it is extremely important to make sure that suiting of melds is proper and follows the above rules.

When melds contain wild cards, special consideration must be taken.  For type 1 melds, the suit of the wild card(s) must be specified upon laying down the meld.  If the player omits specifying the suit before the end of his or her turn, then all other players may assume that the wild card(s)'s suit is open and my accommodate the next player who adds to the meld.  For type 2 melds, the suite of the wild card(s) is determined by its position within the meld.

When a player creates a meld, he or she puts the melded cards, grouped together on the table face up in front of them.

A player may play as many (even all) of his or her cards on his or her turn.  There is no limit to the number of cards that you can meld on your turn.

A player may also use another player's melds to play his or her cards.  To use another player's meld, simply add your card(s) to the other player's meld.

====Scoring====
Once a player has run out of cards by creating or adding to melds (over one or more turns), '''and then discarding his or her final card''', the round ends.  At the end of the round each player counts the value up his or her cards.  The scoring of cards follows these rules
* Cards 2 through 10 are valued at their face value
** A 6 of spades is worth 6 points, a 4 of diamonds is worth 4 points
* Aces may be valued at either 1 point or 13 points, the player's choice
** Most players will want to choose 1 point, but 11 points may be desired in certain circumstances
* Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10 points
* Jokers and wild cards are worth 25 points
** If a 2 of clubs is wild, then it is worht 25 points, not 2 points

A players round score is equal to the sum the point values of the cards in his or her hand.  This score is repeated to the score keeper who increases the player's game score by their round score.

After scoring is completed, the score keeper determins if the game is won.  If the game is not won, the score keeper determins if any players have expired.

====Expiring====
A player expires once he or she has reached or exceeded the maxium allowed score set at the beginning of the game (usually 100 points).  Once this happens, the player is allowed to buy in for the decided upon buy in amount.  If a player decides to buy in, he or she must pay the buy in amount, then he or she will have her score reset to the same score as the player who has the highest score without expiring.

Once all players wishing to buy in have done so, the deal passes to the player to the left of the dealer.  The new dealer collects the cards, shuffles them, and a new round begins.

===Players===
Players may join in to the game at the beginning of any round, however, the new player(s) must pay the buy in amount times the number of expires by the player who has expired the most in the game.  The new player will also start with the same score as the player who has expired the most in the game.

A player may choose not to buy in after having expired, however this player cannot be in contention for winning the game until he has bought back in as a brand new player.  It is not advisable to drop out of a game and then rejoin as it can be quite expensive.

===Winning===
Once a player has won, the runners up are determined by their final score, the lower the better.  The pot money is divided up amongst the winner and runners up as decided at the beginning of the game.

==Common Values When Setting Up a Game==
Here are the values that you should use for a standard game of Vegas Rummy

===The Value of a Buy In===
This can actually vary greatly from game to game.  It really depends on how much everyone is comfortable spending.  A standard game of 100 points will usually never see more than 10 buy in's.  So keep that in mind when choosing a buy in amount.

Good amounts are $1, $2, and $5.

===The Maximum Score===
This should almost always be 100 points, unless players want a different game length.

===Player Handicaps===
Because of the nature of this game, a handicap doesn't necessarily hurt the player all that much.  It does give the other players a slight advantage, but in most cases the handicap will vanish after a couple of rounds.

===Cards Per Player===
This should always be 7 cards.  In some cases, like when playing with only 2 players, you may consider 9 or 11 cards.

===Meld Solidarity===
Games should be played with meld solidarity, without it games can get a little wild with all the card swapping.  Playing without meld solidarity will definitely speed up each round.

===Meld Strictness===
This is not really necessary for games, it will help force melds to be created properly, and in that respect take a little longer to create, but in most cases it won't change the game that much.

===Pot Split===
This can vary from game to game, a good split is usually 70:30 split between the winner and the runner up.  Optionally, the second runner up can receive a single buy in from the runner up.

|[[Image:Flag of Malaysia.svg|thumb|300px|'''National Flag of Malaysia:''' The Malaysian flag, also known as the '''Jalur Gemilang''' (Stripes of Glory), and the '''Malaysian coat of arms''' are symbols of the nation’s stateliness and sovereignty. The Government encourages the flying of the Jalur Gemilang particularly during the Month of Independence in August as an expression of love, loyalty and pride for the country. 

The Malaysian flag or Jalur Gemilang consists of 14 horizontal red and white stripes of equal width (along the fly), representing the 13 component States and the Federal Government. The canton of dark blue in the upper quarter next to the staff and extending down to the top of the fifth stripe stands for the unity of the people of Malaysia. This blue canton was originally chosen to represent a connection between the federation and the Commonwealth but this was gradually downplayed and eventually supplanted by its current interpretation. The union contains a crescent which symbolises Islam, the official religion of Malaysia. The 14 points of the star known as the Bintang Persekutuan or Federal Star signify the unity of the 13 states with the Federal Government. The colour yellow signifies the royal colour of the Rulers. ]]
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials, cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]

|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations. The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]

&lt;u&gt;'''Negaraku (Malay)'''&lt;/u&gt;

:Negaraku, tanah tumpahnya darahku,
:Rakyat hidup, bersatu dan maju,
:Rahmat bahagia, Tuhan kurniakan,
:Raja kita, selamat bertakhta.
:Rahmat bahagia, Tuhan kurniakan,
:Raja kita, selamat bertakhta.

&lt;u&gt;'''History of 'Negaraku' song'''&lt;/u&gt;

At the time of independence, each of the eleven States of Malaya that made up the Federation had their own anthem, but there was no anthem for the Federation as a whole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the time the Chief Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, organized and presided over a committee for the purpose of choosing a suitable national anthem. On his suggestion, a worldwide competition was launched. 514 entries were received from all over the world. None were deemed suitable.

Next the committee decided to invite selected composers of international repute to submit compositions for consideration. The composers chosen were Benjamin Britten, Sir William Walton who had recently composed the march for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, the American opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti and Zubir Said, who later composed the National Anthem of Singapore. They were all turned down too.

The Committee then turned to the Perak State Anthem. On August 5, 1957 it was selected on account of the &quot;traditional flavour&quot; of its melody. New lyrics for the National Anthem were written jointly by the Panel of Judges— with the Tunku himself playing the leading role. At the time this melody was, while still the State Anthem of Perak, Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan.

The song had been very popular on the island of Mahé in the Seychelles. where the Sultan of Perak had formerly been living in exile. He heard it at a public band concert on the island, a song to a popular French melody, originally composed by the lyricist Pierre-Jean de Béranger (1780–1857), who was born and died in Paris. When a member of the Perak royal family was invited to a reception in Europe, he was asked what his state anthem was. Realizing that his state did not in fact possess an anthem, he, in order not to appear backward in front of his hosts, proceeded to hum the aforementioned tune. Thus was an anthem born.

The song was later introduced into an Indonesian Bangsawan (Opera), which was performing in Singapore. In no time at all, the melody became extremely popular and was given the name Terang Bulan. Aside from its dignity and prestige as the Perak State Anthem, the song became a Malayan &quot;evergreen&quot;, playing at parties, in cabarets and sung by almost everybody in the 1920s and 1930s. (Today, of course, since independence, it is not played as a popular melody, and any such use is proscribed by statute.)

The anthem was given a new quick march beat in 1992, which proved unpopular. Some Malaysians have gone as far as to say that the altered tempo resembled circus music, and was the subject of much derision. In July, 2003 it was reported in the Malaysian press that the anthem would be rearranged for the second time and the title and lyric would be changed from Negaraku to Malaysiaku. There was a public outcry of dismay and the change of name was scrapped, but the anthem was re-arranged and returned to the pre-1992 pace by composer Wah Idris.

==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==

In 1954 Tunku Abdul Rahman led a delegation to London to seek independence for Malaya, but the trip proved to be unfruitful. The British were reluctant to grant independence unless there was evidence that the different races in Malaya were able to work together and cooperate in a new and independent country.

As successor, Abdul Rahman saw a way around this by forming a political alliance with the Malayan Chinese Association called the Alliance Party. The coalition proved to be popular among the people. The Alliance was later joined by the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) in 1955, representing the Indian community.

In the same year, the first federal general election was held, and the Alliance Party (Perikatan) won fifty-one out of the fifty-two seats contested. Abdul Rahman was elected as Malaya's first Chief Minister.
 
Tunku Abdul Rahman proclaiming Malayan independence later in 1955 Abdul Rahman made another trip to London to negotiate Malayan independence, and 31 August 1957 was decided as the date for independence. When the British flag was lowered in Kuala Lumpur on Independence Day, Abdul Rahman led the crowd in announcing &quot;Merdeka!&quot; (Freedom!). 

Abdul Rahman dominated the politics of independent Malaya (which became Malaysia in 1963), and led the Alliance to landslide wins in the 1959, and 1964 general elections. The formation of Malaysia was one of Abdul Rahman's greatest achievements. In 1961 he made a speech at the Foreign Correspondents Association of Southeast Asia in Singapore, proposing a federation Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei. On 16 September 1963, with the federation of all these states except Brunei, Abdul Rahman was formally restyled Prime Minister of Malaysia.

Abdul Rahman initiated the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA) in 1961, grouping Malaya, Thailand and the Philippines. This grouping was later replaced by a larger grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which was formed on 8 August 1967.

At the 1969 general election, the Alliance's majority was greatly reduced. Demonstrations following the elections sparked the May 13 racial riots in Kuala Lumpur. Some UMNO leaders led by Tun Abdul Razak were critical of Abdul Rahman's leadership during these events, and an emergency committee MAGERAN took power and declared a state of emergency. Abdul Rahman's powers as Prime Minister were severely curtailed, and on 22 September 1970, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in favour of Abdul Razak. He subsequently resigned as UMNO President in June 1971.

===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===

'''1.''' '''Melaka Sultanate Palace''' - A replica of the Melaka Sultanate palace was reconstructed at the foot of St. Paul's Hill. The design is based on the description of the palace from the sixteenth-century 'Malay Annals,' or 'Sejarah Melayu.' It is the only building of its kind in Malaysia, and it provides a rare glimpse of the ancient Malay kingdom that once flourished here. The palace houses the Malacca Cultural Museum, which includes many artifacts of that kingdom.

'''2.''' &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:St. Paul’s Church.png‎]] --&gt; 

'''St. Paul’s Church''' - On top of St. Paul's Hill is the St. Paul's Church, once the prayer house of the Portuguese Catholics, then turned into burial ground for their noble dead by the Dutch. The tombstones have Latin and Portuguese inscriptions on them. St. Francis Xavier was buried here in 1553 before his body was moved to Goa in India.

'''3.''' 

'''A’ Famosa''' - After the Portuguese captured Melaka, they built a fortress to defend themselves. The fortress, called A'Famosa suffered severe destruction during the Dutch invasion. What's left today is just the entrance walls, still well preserved till today

'''4.''' 

'''The Stadthuys''' - was the official residence of the Dutch Governor. It now houses the Historic Museum and Ethnography Museum which has many traditional bridal costumes and relics on display. Nearby, one will also find the Christ Church built in 1753, another fine example of the Dutch architecture.

'''5.''' &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Kampung Keling Mosque.png‎]] --&gt; 

'''The Kampung Keling Mosque''' - is one of the oldest in the country (17th century). It's a blend of Sumatran and Western architecture with a 3 tier pyramid roof, a touch of Hindu influence perhaps. The carved wooden ceiling is supported by elegant Corinthian-styled columns.

'''6.''' &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Cheng Hoon Temple.png‎]] --&gt; 

'''The Cheng Hoon Temple''' - was constructed in 1645 and is believed to be the oldest Chinese temple in the country. The eaves of the temple are decorated with Mythological figures and animation made from broken glass and porcelain. Besides the figures, the wood carvings and lacquer work are almost breath-taking.

'''7.''' '''Baba and Nyonya Heritage Museum''' - 'Straits Chinese' or the Baba and Nyonya, are Chinese of noble descendants that have adopted much of the Malay culture into theirs. The public can now review the heirloom unique to this heritage at private museum run by the Babas and Nyonyas of Malacca. Floral and pictorial motifs grace parts of the front of the house while the interior is adorned with intricately carved fittings finished in gold leaf.

'''8.''' '''Hang Jebat and Hang Kasturi's mausoleum''' - Two of the Malacca Sultanate's well-known warriors and champion of justice. Hang Jebat was unceremoniously killed by Hang Tuah in a duel of honour that lasted 3 days and 3 nights. He was killed in the name of justice to avenge the sultan's hasty punishment against Hang Tuah for a crime he didn't commit.

'''9.''' '''Hang Tuah's well''' - located in Kampung Duyong where Hang Tuah was born and spent his childhood among four of his good friends who would later become the famous warriors of Malacca Sultanate. The well is said to be the abode of his soul which takes the apparition of a white crocodile. For a commoner to catch the glimpse of Hang Tuah is hardly likely. It is said that the holy among us can ever hope to see the apparition.

'''10.''' '''Maritime Museum''' - is constructed after 'Flora De La Mar', the Portuguese ship that sank off the Coast of Malacca on its way to Portugal. With its hull laden with invaluable treasures seized from Malacca, the ship was doomed from existence had it not for the efforts to Malacca's heritage. At the museum, visitor can get a closer look at Malacca from the famed Malay Sultanate of the 14th century to the Portuguese era, the Dutch era and the British era. There are exhibits of foreign ships that had once called at the port of Malacca during the height of its maritime hegemony.

===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===

10. '''15 September 1992''' - The Petronas Twin Towers project was launched together with Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) Project. The twin Towers have 88 floors in each of the towers and full height 0f 451.9 m above ground level. Thus it had been acknowledged by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban habitat as the new tallest building in the world, making them a new world landmark right in Kuala Lumpur.

==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==

Most Malaysians are granted citizenship by lex soli. All Malaysians are Federal citizens with no formal citizenships within the individual states except for states and the federal territory in East Malaysia where state citizenship is privilege and distinguishable from the Peninsula.[citation needed] Every citizen is issued with a biometric smartchip identity card, known as MyKad, at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times. A citizen is required to present his or her identity card to the police, or in the case of an emergency, to any military personnel, to be identified.[citation needed] If the card cannot be produced immediately, the person technically has 24 hours under the law to produce it at the nearest police station

The criteria to be a Malaysian citizen are:

:1.	Every person born before Malaysia Day who is a citizen of the Malaysia by virtue of these provisions.

:2.	Every person who immediately before Merdeka Day, was a citizen of Malaysia by virtue of any of the provisions of the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, whether by operation of law or otherwise.

::e)	Every person born within Malaysia who is not born a citizen of any country otherwise than by virtue of this paragraph.

A person can become a citizen of Malaysia either by registration or naturalization. In cases by registration, where a person is by operation of law is a citizen but have yet to be registered, such person is entitled to citizenship upon application and be registered as a citizen of Malaysia. For cases by naturalization, this refers to the process of admitting a person not a citizen of Malaysia to citizenship. This is subjected to the requirements and conditions of the Federal Government. Any person holding Malaysian citizenship is also disallowed to hold any other country's citizenship. Malaysia does not allow dual citizenship.

Those applying for citizenship by registration must have &quot;an elementary knowledge of the Malay language&quot;. Those applying to become naturalised citizens must have &quot;an adequate knowledge of the Malay language&quot; and have resided in the country for ten of the past twelve years, including the twelve months immediately preceding the application. These requirements are set out by Part III of the Constitution; however, as there is no objective definition of what constitutes elementary or adequate knowledge of Malay, in practice, the tests are often subjective, sometimes even varying in whether a written knowledge of Malay is required.

==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==
Malaysia is a federal constitutional elective monarchy. The federal head of state of Malaysia is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, commonly referred to as the King of Malaysia. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected to a five-year term among the nine hereditary Sultans of the Malay states; the other four states, which have titular Governors, do not participate in the selection.

The system of government in Malaysia is closely modeled on that of Westminster parliamentary system, a legacy of British colonial rule. In practice however, more power is vested in the executive branch of government than in the legislative, and the judiciary has been weakened by sustained attacks by the government during the Mahathir era. Since independence in 1957, Malaysia has been governed by a multi-party coalition known as the Barisan Nasional (formerly known as the Alliance).

Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures. The bicameral parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives or Dewan Rakyat (literally the &quot;Chamber of the People&quot;) and the upper house, the Senate or Dewan Negara (literally the &quot;Chamber of the Nation&quot;). The 222-member House of Representatives are elected from single-member constituencies that are drawn based on population for a maximum term of five years. All 70 Senators sit for three-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, two representing the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, one each from federal territories of Labuan and Putrajaya, and 40 are appointed by the king. Besides the Parliament at the federal level, each state has a unicameral state legislative chamber (Malay: Dewan Undangan Negeri) whose members are elected from single-member constituencies. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, with the last general election being in March 2008.[40] The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of Parliament and is responsible to that body.

State governments are led by chief ministers (Menteri Besar in Malay states or Ketua Menteri in states without hereditary rulers), who is a state assembly member from the majority party in the Dewan Undangan Negeri.In the states with hereditary rulers,the chief ministers are requiered to be a Malay Muslim.This discriminatory laws had exist since the early 20th century and are yet to be reviewed

==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==
The law of Malaysia is mainly based on the common law legal system. This was a direct result of the colonisation of Malaya, Sarawak, and North Borneo by Britain between early 1800s to 1960s. The supreme law of the land the Constitution of Malaysia—sets out the legal framework and rights Malaysian citizens. Federal laws enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia apply throughout the country. There are also state laws enacted by the State Legislative Assembly which applies in the particular state. The constitution of Malaysia also provides for a unique dual justice system the secular laws (criminal and civil) and sharia laws. The operations and relationship between the two legal systems can be complicated and has caused uncertainties.

Prior to the independence in 1957, most of the laws of United Kingdom were imported and either made into local legislations or simply applied as case laws. Malaysian law is also based on other jurisdictions namely Australia and India. The criminal law in Malaysia the Criminal Procedure Code was based on the Indian criminal code. Similarly, the Contracts Act is based on the Indian model. Malaysian land law is based on the Australian Torrens system.

The Constitution of Malaysia, or the Federal Constitution, is the supreme law of the land. It provides the legal framework for the laws, legislations, courts, and other administrative aspects of the law. It also defines the government and monarch, and their powers, as well as the rights of the citizens. (Please refer to the attached Malaysia Constitution file attached.)

The dual system of law is provided in Article 121(1A) of the Constitution of Malaysia. Article 3 also provides that Islamic law is a state law matter with the exception for the Federal Territories of Malaysia. Islamic law refers to the sharia law, and in Malaysia it is known and spelled as syariah. The court is known as the Syariah Court. Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively minimal role in defining the laws on the country. First and foremost, sharia law only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts shall have jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example, marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states, there is the sharia criminal laws, for example, the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 3000, and imprisonment to not more than 6 months. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law.

Complications have arisen with regard to the dual justice system. An example of this will be in the context of freedom of religion. Article 11 of the Constitution provides that &quot;Every person has the right to profess and practice his religion&quot;. However in the case of Lina Joy a (Malay) who converted to Christianity the Federal Court of Malaysia refused to allow her to change her religion indicated in her identity card (MyKad). The judges held that they had no jurisdiction on the matter that it was a matter of the Syariah Court, as indicated in Article 121(1A) of the Constitution.

Federal laws are made by legislators (members of Parliament and senators) sitting in the Parliament of Malaysia and applies nationwide. State laws are made by assemblymen sitting in the State Legislative Assembly (Dewan Undangan Negeri) and only apply in the particular state. Article 75 of the “Constitution” clearly states that a federal law shall prevail over any inconsistent state laws, including sharia laws.

The states of Sabah and Sarawak joined Malaya and Singapore to form Malaysia in 1963, and there are special laws applicable only to these two states. An important area in this regard is the immigration law. Other areas of law peculiar to these two states are land law. Generally, land matters and natural resource management is a federal law matter. However, there are special provisions in the Constitution allowing for the states of Sabah and Sarawak to create separate legislations. For example, in the Peninsular, the National Land Code governs most of the laws relating to land. In Sabah, the main legislation is the Sabah Land Ordinance; and in Sarawak, the Sarawak Land Code.

The laws of Malaysia can be divided into two types of laws written law and unwritten law. Written laws are laws which have been enacted in the constitution or in legislations. Unwritten laws are laws which are not contained in any statutes and can be found in case decisions. This is known as the common law or case law. In situations where there is no law governing a particular circumstance, Malaysian case law may apply. If there is no Malaysian case law, English case law can be applied. There are instances where Australian, Indian, and Singaporean cases are used as persuasive authorities.

The application of English law or common law is specified in the statutes. Section 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that English law shall be applied in cases where no specific legislation has been enacted. Similarly, in the context of civil law, Sections 3 and 5 of the Civil Law Act allows for the application of English common law, equity rules, and statutes in Malaysian civil cases where no specific laws have been made. In 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia, Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim questioned to need to resort to the English common law despite Malaysia having already been independent for 50 years and proposed to replace it with Islamic law jurisprudence or sharia law. However, the Malaysian Bar Council responded by saying that the common law is part of Malaysian legal system and that there is no basis to replace it. Court appeals to the Privy Council in England have already been abolished in 1985. The principle of stare decisis also applies in Malaysian law. This means that any decisions by a court higher in the hierarchy will be binding upon the lower courts.

Another source of unwritten laws are the customary laws. Most ethnic groups in Malaysia have their own customary law which they follow. Some have the force of law, while some has lost its force after being superseded by Parliament legislations. The Malays in Peninsular Malaysia adhere to the Adat which mainly deals with land tenure and inheritance. The two main forms of adat are Adat Perpatih and Adat Temenggong. Adat Perpatih has matrilineal characteristics and Adat Temenggong has patrilineal characteristics.

In East Malaysia there are also customary laws which are still in force. These laws apply mainly in the rural areas, and they are enforced by the Native Court. In Sabah, an unconventional form of punishment that can be imposed by the Native Court is sogit, which is a form of compensation whereby a wrongdoer may be ordered to pay in the form of livestock or crops. The Native Court is governed by the Native Court Enactment, and the decisions of the court can be appealed to the mainstream courts of Malaysia. In Peninsular, a similar court is the Penghulu Court. There are also Chinese and Hindu customary laws mainly relating to family law matters. However, following an enactment in 1976 these laws have lost their effects.

== Hello! ==

Hi Darkkey,

I added an image depicting the national flag of Malaysia and copied text from Wikipedia describing it.  Thanks for starting the page!  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:41, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

== Signing contributions ==

Hi Darkkey,

It would be better if you did not sign each contribution you make to Wikibooks.  If you are the primary contributor to a chapter in the AY Honors Answer Book, you can make an [[About the Author/Darkkey|About the Author]] page and include that at the end of the chapter just after the &quot;References&quot; section.  To make it do that, just add this text:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{:About the Author/Darkkey}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
One of the Wikibooks bureaucrats has already removed your signature from the Stars honor, and it would not really be appropriate to add an about the author section there (since I wrote most of that one).  But if you are the primary author of a chapter, you are encouraged to add a blurb at the bottom.  See the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Radio Electronics|Radio Electronics]] honor for how I added mine to one. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:54, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

== On hiring out professional translation ==

===Quality – Cost ===
The cost and quality of a translation can vary. For professional products especially, you are advised to be wary of extremely low-cost translations, as professional translation is a service that takes time and effort, something a translator would charge for if they are in fact spending the necessary time and effort on it. When publishing a text with an otherwise large total project cost, it would be unwise to save a few dollars on translation and end up with an awkward text. Keep in mind that for the foreign market segments, the translator is just as crucial as your copy-writers. A translation will also need proof-reading and a final review. It is imperative that this be performed independently from the translation. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Professional translators will normally advise against translation into any language other than the translator's mother tongue. If you want something translated into German, you should ask a person whose native language is German. The same applies to French, Russian and English. To a certain extent this also applies to American, British and Australian. Large differences exist between Spanish spoken in Europe as opposed to Latin American Spanish, or between standard European French as opposed to the French spoken in Quebec. The unabridged version of this guide book can be found on [http://www.translogic.no/guide.html tips] about translation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Finalize the text before starting the translation ===

No matter how tempting it might be to start the translation work parallel with the authoring, this will invariably turn out to be more expensive than providing a final text for translation. And even worse; it presents a greater risk that there will be errors in the completed product. Sometimes you might not have a choice; the deadlines are so short that the translating has to begin as soon as possible. In such a case, be sure to see to it that all versions of the originals are referenced by version numbers and dates, and that all changes to the text are clearly marked. Time is money, and the time needed to manage changes and correct translations because of errors in the original document will be expensive.

Because translators place your text under close scrutiny, you might try to make use of this opportunity to make sure your original text is comprehensible. Encourage the translator to ask questions, this may reveal any unclear sections and possibly enhance the quality of your text. Perhaps ask for comments back so you can revise it before sending it in for a translation, but this is a service not all translators will provide and will probably cost extra.

That said, take care to have realistic expectations concerning what a translator is able to do, or to fully communicate what you are asking of them. The translator will usually translate one sentence at a time. Re-working the text, considering the document as a whole, and to a certain degree, authoring a totally new and better text will invariably take more time than merely translating it, thus costing more.

=== Inform the translator of the purpose of your text ===

A speech is not the same as a web page. A marketing brochure is not the same as a user’s manual or a catalogue. A press release is not the same as an offer of shares for public subscription. You should also consider how the text will be read and interpreted. On one hand there are scientific papers in which each sentence will be thoroughly scrutinized and assessed by critical peers, while on the other hand there are magazine articles that are read only for entertainment, or web pages that are merely browsed for general content.

Everything; style, wording, and sentence construction will vary according to where the text will be presented and the purpose it is intended to serve. Paying attention to these issues will assure you maximal impact in terms of your message. This may have substantial influence on the price. A glossy brochure in which every word and sentence is “polished” may understandably be more expensive than a rough translation of an internal memo. 

Provide enough time for the translator to perform her/his work. Today, no one can afford to sit around waiting for a job that will arrive &quot;probably on Tuesday, maybe not until Wednesday&quot;. Most translators are freelancers, working late evenings as well as weekends. They will appreciate very much receiving early notification of when the job will arrive, so that they can plan their own schedule. 

=== Technical issues ===

It is a well known fact that last minute changes, headings, abbreviations, line breaks or other changes to the words may ruin an otherwise perfect text. Always be careful about making changes over the telephone. This often results in misunderstandings.

Typographical conventions vary from country to country; the use of the apostrophe, quotation marks, numbers, and comma varies. Paper sizes also vary – in Europe the sheet is called A4 while other countries use Legal or Letter. These sizes are somewhat different, and thus they will not hold the same amount of text per page. A very common problem is that the space for text in text boxes and figure call-outs is too limited. In cases where everything is packed into a limited space, one has to use abbreviations, a practice that does not result in a clear text.

To avoid ambiguity, write dates using the ISO/ANSI standard yyyy-mm-dd, i.e. 2005-04-02 for April 2, 2005 (this format is also adopted by the UN). Also remember that eight o’clock might be AM or PM, so please use the twenty-four hour clock: 08:00 and 20:00. Why? If you write a date as 02-04-05 (02/04/05), it may mean April 2, 2005 or February 4, 2005, or April 5, 2002. Historically, it may also mean April 2, 1905. 

Typography regarding numbers, such as 10,000.00 and 10.000,00 differ from country to country; not to mention the meanings of words regarding numbers, such as “billion”. One ”milliard” (1 000 000 000) in Norwegian means one billion in the US, whereas one ”billion” (1 000 000 000 000) in Norway means one trillion in the US.
 
=== Professional Translation and Computers ===

==== File formats ====

Large translation agencies will normally receive all kinds of formats, graphics, drawings, and faxes. 

Please note that there is considerably more work required in translating single words spread over a graphic image than translating a free-flowing text in MS Word format. If it is possible to give the translator a clean text file for translation and then later place the text where it is supposed to be in the printed material, this will result in overall savings. 

Special fonts or intricate formatting will also add to the translator’s work load. Do you really want the translator to spend time on graphic specialties that are routine tasks for the DTP specialist? If funded, you can save money / meet your needs better by using the appropriate 'craftsman' for the specific task to be done, and if you are working on a budget, your pockets will benefit if you save these minor, yet complex tasks for yourself after the translation.

Normally you will achieve the best and most cost-effective result by supplying your translator with Word-files. PDF-files have to be converted and formatted before translation, and they may, expectedly, charge you a fee for this.

==== E-mail ====

These days, almost all documents are exchanged via e-mail. Be aware that one cannot count on E-mail messages reaching the addressee in every case. It may arrive tomorrow or a few days after. It may get tangled up with other e-mails, or it may disappear entirely. There have been instances where mail servers have lost thousands of e-mails without notifying either party. This is an unfortunate occurrence, but it does happen from time to time. One way to deal with this is to send follow up e-mails.

==== Machine translation – Computer Assisted Translation ====
Some people are looking for software that can translate the text directly on their PC. In case you need to translate a segment of text solely for your own use, machine translation may be of some assistance, though if you use it for presentational or communicative purposes of your own intent to others, it can make you seem to be expressing confidently something you didn't mean to say.

That said, if you do want to translate what others said, keeping in mind it may not be entirely accurate/understandable, it is quick and inexpensive; some services are even free of charge. Like

*[http://www.freetranslation.com Freetranslation]
*[http://babelfish.altavista.com Babelfish]
*[http://google.com/language_tools]

Again, these are usually not suitable for serious translation of a text you want to send someone else – the result will make you appear to be inarticulate or stupid.  For an amusing trial run, you might try to have your PC translate some text from English into a foreign language and then back into English. Having seen the result, I can guarantee that you will not want to use that text for any sort of occupational purposes.

Careful editing of a machine translated text by a skilled translator is an alternative, but it will not save you any expenses overall. Most translators will tell you that a machine translated text is so bad that it would be quicker and less expensive to do the job over again manually.

Several software companies, of which [http://www.translationzone.com/en/ Trados], [http://www.atril.com/  Déjà Vu] and [http://www.wordfast.net/ WordFast], are the best known, have developed software to assist translation agencies and translators in their work. In addition, few companies, provide cheap translation solutions like [http://languageproz.com CAT LangaugeProz]. 

Such software can be valuable time-savers when translating repetitive texts. The greatest advantage though, is that the software makes it easier to ensure consistency throughout the translation, i.e. repeated terms or expressions will be translated the same way in all documents. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation CAT (Computer Assisted Translation)]

=== Processes of professional translation ===

==== Does back translation work? ====

First, you translate from language A to language B. Then, as a measure to assess quality, you translate the text back to the original language A, which allows you to compare the result with the original. This seems like an attractive method for checking the translation, but actually the translator will have far too many synonyms from which to choose, so back translation will be a futile exercise in terms of quality assurance. People who have participated in such experiments, generally agree that it provides useful experience and some new knowledge for the translator; however, as a quality check it is of little value. In this respect, structured checks and proof-reading will prove to be more efficient and considerably less expensive.

==== Think internationally from the start - Localizing ====

Localizing means more than just translation; it also means that the text content will be adapted to the culture of the country/geography in question. The translator will need to know how local telephone numbers and addresses should be treated. Should they be replaced by addresses in the target country or should country codes in addition to ”the official name of the country” be added? What about given names and names of places used as examples in the text? Should, for example, ”Knut Hansen” be replaced by ”John Smith”, and ”Kongsberg” by ”Detroit”? 

Regarding addresses linking to web sites, are these the same for the English, Norwegian, and German editions? For websites, inform the translator of how screen menu items are to be treated. Are they intended to remain in the original language on the screen, or are they to be displayed in the target language? 

To facilitate localization, culture-specific phrases should be avoided as far as possible. References to national sports are often misinterpreted or not understood at all in a foreign language, and the same goes for literary and cultural phrases/sayings. Always exercise caution when referring to parts of the human body; these have widely different interpretations in different cultures. Also be careful when using humor, as it may backfire unintentionally. It would be wise to avoid metaphors or puns that are specific to your country or your language; these will force the translator to add elaborate explanations or paraphrases.

Some examples:

”…hook, line and sinker” may be found in English, but what about German and French? The same goes for ”The full Monty”, a phrase indicating nudity which will be totally incomprehensible to Japanese readers. ”Time-out” is a popular expression that will be meaningless to anyone unfamiliar with American sports. ”We’ll hit them for six” is an expression from the sport of cricket that will confuse everybody but the British (In American the expression will be “The whole nine yards”). ”A baker’s dozen” means thirteen. The expression ”Der ligger hunden begravet” (literally ”That’s where the dog is buried”) works fine in Norwegian, but how does one say this in Spanish? When Electrolux launched a sales campaign for a new vacuum cleaner in the USA, they used the slogan “Nothing sucks like an Electrolux”. The expression had another effect than intended. Ford Company failed to break into the Spanish-speaking market with their Nova car (in Spanish “no va” means “does not work”). 

Careless and haphazard use of local idioms is rarely funny. Many people may even be offended. Local coloring may be retained if deemed necessary; however you might want to check with the translator as to what is possible and/or sensible. The translator may well be given free rein, but please keep in mind that if they do provide this service, it may be expensive, as you are asking a lot of thought, time, and creativity of them.

==== Simplification ====

When you have hundreds of pages of text to be translated, take a moment to consider the situation. Is it actually necessary to translate all of the pages, or would it be possible to translate an abbreviated version? A quick consultation with your contributors (if you're not the author) to decide what information is indispensable is always a good idea. 

A little effort at an early stage may save considerable expenses later on. Elaborate descriptions and bombastic statements on internal affairs can often improve a text by being deleted. Internal trade terminology should always be used sparingly unless you are 100% certain who your target readership is.

Last year a large technical company sent a 500-page user’s manual to a company named [http://www.translogic.no/ TransLogic], asking them to have it simplified and finalized. The result was a reduction of some 230 pages before the translating itself had started, and the outsourcer was surprised to find that the manual turned out to be an even better product following the trimming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Definition of (phase) jitter===
Although the term jitter, strictly speaking, may refer to several properties of a signal, most often it refers to the phase of the signal.&lt;br&gt;
In this book it always means jitter of the signal phase, only. The phase is defined at discrete instants only, that is at the transitions of the signal through a certain level threshold.

More formally, jitter is here defined as:

&lt;center&gt;'''The''' (jittering) '''&lt;u&gt;time difference&lt;/u&gt; between corresponding transitions of two signals'''&lt;/center&gt;


# In some cases it is convenient to remove the reference to the frequency of the pulses of the transmitted signal (&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; or f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; where &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;pi;f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;br /&gt; Instead of the jitter in seconds it is convenient to represent the related quantity jitter/&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (in [[Wikipedia:Radian|radian]]) or jitter/f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; in [[Wikipedia:Unit interval (data transmission)|UI]] (Unit Interval) i.e. as a fraction of the period corresponding to the transmission of one pulse.&lt;br /&gt;The true dimension of jitter remains seconds and not the dimension-less related quantities that are used for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;The reconciliation shall be made with a division by, for instance, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and a phase delay of 0.86 rad is in actuality a jitter (= a time delay) of 0.86/&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; seconds.
# The ITU-T defines jitter as ''the variation of a digital signal’s transitions from their ideal positions in time'', for instance in G.810&lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Rec. G.810(08/96): Definitions and terminology for synchronization networks&lt;/ref&gt;, where jitter and wander are defined accordingly, with separation boundary at 10 Hz:&lt;br /&gt;
:::'''(timing) jitter''': The short-term variations of the significant instants of a timing signal from their ideal positions in time (where short-term implies that these variations are of frequency greater than or equal to 10 Hz).&lt;br /&gt;
:::'''wander''': The long-term variations of the significant instants of a digital signal from their ideal position in time (where long-term implies that these variations are of frequency less than 10 Hz).&lt;br /&gt;
::In the scope of CDRs however, &lt;u&gt;the jitter is between a clock waveform and&lt;/u&gt; (the clock implicit in) &lt;u&gt;a NRZ data stream&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The jitter in such case can only be defined (and measured) when a transition and its corresponding one are present.&lt;br /&gt;This point in addition to the reluctance to use an &quot;ideal&quot; reference in a definition explains the (equivalent) definition given above.

=====Jitter and phase noise: the same thing?=====

Jitter and phase noise are descriptions of the same phenomenon from different points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Phase noise and jitter -- a primer for digital designers  Neil Roberts 2003 http://www.eetimes.com/design/communications-design/4139019/Phase-noise-and-jitter--a-primer-for-digital-designers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oscillator Phase Noise:
Theory vs. Practicality, App Note 03.2008 © 2008 Greenray Industries, Inc. All rights reserved.  http://www.greenrayindustries.com/library/PhaseNoise08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, radio frequency engineers speak of the phase noise of an oscillator, whereas digital system engineers work with the jitter of a clock, as pointed out in the [[w:Phase noise|Wikipedia definition of phase noise]].

A mountain may look different from different points of view. It may be difficult to imagine the view from a point different from the present one.

Passing from jitter to phase noise may be equally difficult and some caution is necessary &lt;ref&gt;Jitter and Phase Noise in Ring Oscillators,  A. Hajimiri, S. Limotyrakis and T.H.Lee (IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, June 1999), a paper appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High Performance Systems - From Devices to Architectures&quot; edited by Behzad Ravasi ISBN 0-471-44727-7,  2003 &lt;/ref&gt;. It is important to keep in mind that the jitter in a CDR is the sum of unwanted phase deviations (noise) and of the useful signal (the phase that the CDR wants to acquire and to stay locked into).

=====Total noise and phase noise (jitter)=====
Generally speaking, a waveform is affected by both amplitude and phase noise&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;&gt;IEEE Std 1139-1999 IEEE Standard Definitions of Physical Quantities for Fundamental Frequency and Time Metrology—Random Instabilities, http://www.umbc.edu/photonics/Menyuk/Phase-Noise/Vig_IEEE_Standard_1139-1999%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

But a clock waveform (sinusoidal or square) does not vary in amplitude, and just jitters.

Therefore the side-bands of the [[w:Spectral density|Power Spectral Density (PSD)]] of a clock signal are phase-noise side-bands, i.e. jitter side-bands.

More precisely, the upper side-band translated into base-band is nothing but the jitter PSD! ''(divided by 2)''&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;/&gt;

When the signal is not a clock but a data stream (NRZ or encoded), its PSD explodes into many small replicas of the clock spectrum and may become even a continuous shape if the encoding data are casual. 

A dedicated CDR block, the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator|phase comparator]], is used to output a meaningful comparison result between an encoded signal and a clock that are presented at its two inputs.

===Eye diagram===
On the screen of an oscilloscope, triggering the display with the clock signal, it is possible to display such clock and an [[w:Non-return-to-zero|NRZ]] data stream associated with it.

[[Image:Signals on the scope.png|center|530px|530px|]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Signals on the scope''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The subsequent traces of the data waveform trace different patterns, owing to the random nature of the source data.&lt;br&gt;
Note that the physical limitation of slew rate and of signal bandwidth reduce the slope and smooth the corners of the signal transitions.&lt;br&gt;
The presence of noise, of intersymbol interference and of various types of distortions, that affect any real transmission, make the individual traces spread out and differ from each other.&lt;br&gt; 
In practice, the pattern of a train of “eyes”, the [[w:Eye pattern|&quot;eye pattern&quot;]] will appear on the scope. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Why call it an &quot;eye&quot; diagram?''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:eye diagram etymology.png|center|500px|500px|]]&lt;br&gt;

During the signal transmission, noise, intersymbol interference, channel non linearities and jitter are added to the signal.&lt;br&gt;
The eye diagram at the receiving end (using the original, un-jittered clock to trigger the scope) shows a closing eye. The closing eye corresponds in fact to a signal that is less easily detected (= less “visible”).&lt;br&gt;
When the data stream is a coded multilevel signal, the diagram shows a stack of eyes.
[[Image:Multilevel eye diagrams.png|center|500px|]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;''3-level eye diagram''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Relative phase===
The received signal can be strongly amplified and then limited, so that , as a result, it switches  rapidly between two opposite levels.&lt;br&gt;
The time position of its abrupt level transitions still betray the analog and imperfect nature of the signal.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:squared eye.png|center|500px|]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;''In the signal, the transitions through the mid-level amplitude carry the timing information.''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The positions of the level transitions move continuously back and forth in an irregular, almost nervous, manner (= they jitter).&lt;br&gt;
If the vibration reaches as far as the middle point before the next transition (= the center of the eye diagram), the bit level in the received signal may be falsely detected (= errored bit).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Jitter (and wander) definition===
For a precise mathematical definition of the jitter, the first step is to clearly define the reference.

The instantaneous phase of the signal originated by the transmit clock (= that is '''the phase of the transmit clock''' itself) '''is the reference''', and it is represented by '''&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;t'''.

Any further processing of the signal will add a fixed delay '''d''' plus a small, irregularly variable (= jittery) contribution to '''the signal phase''', that will become then: '''&amp;omega;t + d &amp;omega; + j(t)'''.&lt;br&gt;
'''The phase jitter j(t)''' is the part additional to the phase of the original signal and to the transit delay.

The reference frequency of the signal is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (radian/second).

A periodic signal (the shape is not important) is defined as: 
&lt;center&gt;p(&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t)&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t can be viewed as the output phase of an ideal, noise-less and drift-less oscillator of angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
A signal of the type:
&lt;center&gt;p(&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t + x(t))&lt;/center&gt;
where x(t) is in radian, represents an angular phase and describes a deviation from the perfectly linear phase increase &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t,
is a jittered version of p(&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t), and '''&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{x(t)}{\omega_0} &lt;/math&gt; is the jitter''' in seconds.
[[Image:x(t) is the jitter.png|center|600px|]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;''The jitter added to the (otherwise linear) phase of a constant frequency signal''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In some practical cases it is useful to distinguish between the [[w:Alternating current|AC]] part of x(t) ''– and call it '''jitter''' in a restricted sense -'' from its very low frequency components ''– and call that '''wander''' -''.

The wander part of the jitter is made up by the low frequency (or truly [[w:Direct current|DC]], which is nothing but a frequency drift) components.
 
More precisely, the wander components are the low frequency ones that impact in the topic under study only with unidirectional, slow but large, deviations. During the duration of the phenomenon being studied, the drift components last less than one half cycle at their frequency (their period is more than twice the interval of time being considered).
 
The jitter proper is made by the components relevant to the topic under study as periodic functions of  time (or as functions of j&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in the mathematical model).

A slow, large deviation of the signal phase from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t would be seen on the scope as a drift of the eye diagram to the left (negative time variation) or to the right (positive time variation).

The eye drift of a real signal, although slow, exhibits in practice the same random behavior of the jitter in general.  This drifting sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, is called wander.

===To control something, you must first be able to measure it (Engineering principle)===
How to measure jitter then?

Oscilloscopes and spectrum analysers are the fundamental tools.

A really excellent tutorial on this fundamental aspect are the 6 lessons from Ransom Stephens in:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tektronics Jitter 360° Knowledge Series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
from http://www.tek.com/learning/ .

A good concise paper with reference to the various standards for jitter is the Agilent article
&lt;ref&gt;http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5988-6254EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

It seems almost repetitive to have 2 different sections on both Electrical burns and Electrocution when we can cover both in one. So why not put this up for deletion and move the info over to Electrical Burns. --[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] ([[User talk:Nugger|talk]]) 15:07, 17 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

I am advocating the deletion of this page as I have reorganised the entry on Viruses into General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Viruses. Prions and viroids are quite different from viruses so they should not be on the same page.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

''From the 1881 Household Cyclopedia''

Beat up an egg, and to it add as much flour as will make a very stiff dough. Roll it out in a thin sheet, flour it, and roll it up closely, as you would do a sheet of paper. Then with a sharp knife cut it in shavings about like cabbage for slaw; flour these cuttings to prevent them from adhering to each other, and add them to your soup whilst it is boiling. Let them boil 10 minutes.

''From the 1881 Household Cyclopedia''

Take 3 pounds of the scrag of a neck of very fresh mutton, cut it into several pieces, wash them in cold water, and put them into a stewpan with 2 quarts of cold springwater; place the stewpan on the fire to boil, skim it well, and then add a couple of turnips cut into slices a few branches of parsley, a sprig of green thyme, and a little salt. When it has boiled gently by the side of the stove for an hour and a half, skim off the fat from the surface, and then let it be strained through a lawn sieve into a basin and kept for use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ON EDIT == 

=== Statement ===
(+)	Appearance		(+)	Standard			Console	

=== Syntax === 
ON EDIT {FN userFunction|GOSUB{lineNumber|&quot;stmtLabel&quot;}} 

=== Description === 
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as an edit-event handling routine. An edit-event handling routine is called in response to a keypress, if there is an active editable edit field in the current output window. After such a keypress event occurs, FB does not call your designated routine immediately. Instead, your program continues executing until the next HANDLEEVENTS statement is reached; at that time, FB calls your designated routine once for each keypress event that occurred. FB calls your routine without displaying the new character in the edit field. Your edit-event handling routine should examine the TEKEY$ function to determine which key was pressed. To apply that character (or some other character of your choice) to the edit field, your routine should execute the TEKEY$ statement. If you have not designated any edit-event handling routine, then HANDLEEVENTS applies the keypress directly to the current edit field. The most common use for an edit-event handling routine is to inhibit or alter the display of certain kinds of characters in the edit field. In most cases, you will want the following keys to be processed normally:
*CHR$(8) (delete)
*CHR$(28) (left arrow)
*CHR$(29) (right arrow)
*CHR$(30) (up arrow)
*CHR$(31) (down arrow)
*CHR$(13) (Return (if edit field type allows Return's))


== Example: ==
This program limits the entered contents of the edit field to a number of not more than four digits. DEF FN DoEdit '(prototype)
&lt;pre&gt;
WINDOW 1
TEXT _sysFont, 12
EDIT FIELD 1,&quot;&quot;,(10,10)-(100,30),_framedNoCR
ON EDIT FN DoEdit
DO
ÊÊÊHANDLEEVENTS
UNTIL _false
END
'----------
LOCAL FN DoEdit
theKey$ = TEKEY$
efID = WINDOW(_efNum)
SELECT CASE theKey$
CASE &quot;0&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;9&quot;
LONG IF LEN(EDIT$(efID)) &lt; 4
TEKEY$ = theKey$ 'display the digit
XELSE
BEEP 'Too many digits!
END IF
CASE CHR$(8),CHR$(28),CHR$(29),CHR$(30),CHR$(31)
TEKEY$ = theKey$ 'Apply the cursor movement
CASE ELSE
BEEP 'Illegal character!
END SELECT
END FN 
&lt;/pre&gt;


Note:
If you use the ON EDIT FN userFunction syntax, then userFunction must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your edit-event handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result. The following kinds of keypresses do not trigger a call to your edit-event handling routine:

*Menu Command-key equivalents;
*-period;
*Arrow keys in a direction that the insertion point can't move (these generate DIALOG events instead);
*Modifier keys (e.g. Shift, Control, etc.) by themselves.

If there is no active editable edit field in the current window or if you are running under the Appearance Compliant runtime, keypresses are treated as DIALOG events (see the _evKey event in the DIALOG function).

== Hello... ==

I´m come from Duisburg Germany. I´m sorry for my bad english, but I think, that I learn here in the english Wikibooks more englisch. I want to write a germanbook, I work in the german Wikibooks on a project for Schoolbooks, can I spend some pages for an german learing book, please correct me, if I do an mistake, or can speak here someone german (Deutsch: Also ich werde mich jetzt anmelden, damit ihr mir antwort geben könnt) --[[User: Oceancetaceen]]

== Image help ==

How do we include images that are already uploaded in Commons? Specifically, could anyone tell me how to put [[w:en:Image:Hilbert_curve.svg|this]] image [[Topology/Countability#Hahn-Mazurkiewicz_Theorem|here]]?

[[User:SPat|SPat]] ([[User talk:SPat|talk]]) 08:16, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

:Two separate questions, so they get separate answers:
:* To use an image from Commons, just use it as if it had been uploaded to Wikibooks. The MediaWiki software will check for the image locally, and if it doesn't find it, it will check for it in Commons.
:* The Hilbert curve image you've specified is a local image in Wikipedia, so it can't be used directly. You can either move it to Commons yourself using the [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php Commons helper], request for it to be moved to Commons for you, or simply use one of the other images already on [[commons:Category:Hilbert curves|Commons]]. 
:Let's know if you need further assistance, especially if you need the Wikipedia image moved to Commons. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:26, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

== re Wikibook SLOVIO ==

Hi!  your text says: &quot;... the name of the language comes from the pre-Slavic word SLOVO...&quot;
Mind you: &quot;pre-Slavic&quot; is wrong. There's no pre-Slavic (or for that matter &quot;pre-Germanic&quot;, &quot;pre-Latin&quot;, pre-Greek&quot; ...)language, unless you consider reconstructed Indo-European a real language. So I'd suggest you change it to &quot;old-Slavic&quot;, which it really is!
   Thanks for your attention. You're doing a great job!    Bruno

== Capitalization of sections ==

Unlike Wikipedia, Wikibooks uses ''title case'' instead of ''sentence case'' in the names of books and their chapters, as specified at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. Is there any consensus on whether ''sections'' of the books should be in title case or sentence case? Judging from looking around the books in here, there seems to be inconsistency among different books, even within single books. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:10, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

Apparently this extension is now live on the testing sites, and will possibly be coming to Wikibooks soon. From past discussion, I think we do want the extension, but there have been widely varying ideas of how we should be using it. Since much of that discussion was hypothetical, I think we should discuss this again in terms of what the extension actually does. I'm definitely not up to speed on exactly what it does, but perhaps those who are could explain the features concisely, and suggest uses. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:25, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

== Massive SUL problems, project mergers ==

:[[Image:Symbol wtf vote.svg|15px]] '''[[w:April Fools' Day|April Fools'!]]''' It was fun while it lasted. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:32, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
It shouldn't come as a surprise that SUL has cause a few problems in the past few days. We've been pretty safe here on Wikibooks, but other projects haven't been so lucky. Unfortunately, all the username conflicts have caused corruption in some of the databases. This, in turn, is causing a domino effect because all the databases are hosted on the same set of servers.  A few people, specifically the developers, most of the board members, and also a large number of wikipedians want to merge all the sister projects together into Wikipedia, to keep the databases together. I guess they think this will solve all the user rename problems without having rewrite all the software, or fix the errors that the SUL beta test has been causing. The rationale here is that an emergency project merger, while messy, will help to stabilize all the sites and prevent massive crashes and data losses.

Details are few at the moment, but the gist of the idea goes something like this:
#All the pages from sister projects get moved into specific namespaces at Wikipedia. We would be the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace, of course. Pages will be moved directly, without changing namespaces. So, our policy pages would be &quot;Wikibooks:Wikibooks:...&quot;. Talk pages would become &quot;Wikibooks:Talk:...&quot; and &quot;Talk:Wikibooks talk:...&quot;, etc. I think this is stupid, but the developers assured me that a couple bots could be employed to fix all the naming problems after all the pages are uploaded.
#The user table will be merged into Wikipedia, and conflicts will basically be resolved like they said SUL would be originally: whichever accounts have the most edits &quot;win&quot;, essentially. If anybody needs a rename because of a conflict, let me know now and I can help rename you. This is important because I won't be able to after a while...
#All our admins and bcrats and checkusers get demoted, although people at WP claim that our trusted admins can be fast-tracked to become admins over there too. I spoke to at least one developer who says that they could create new usergroups, like &quot;wbadmin&quot;, and they would only be administrators for pages in the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace. I don't particularly like this idea, because I'm not sure how vandal blocks and stuff would work.
#We would gradually be renamed to &quot;Wikipedia Books&quot;. Our current logo discussion is basically going to be suspended (we don't need a separate logo since we won't be a separate project anymore). I think our URL will be http://en.books.wikipedia.org/, but I've also heard that we could be temporarily moved to http://books.en.wikipedia.org/Wikibooks_OLD/wbooks_en_db/en/, while they get the databases merged and the DNS entries updated. 
#All of our images would need to get deleted because of problems with namespace mergers with Wikipedia and Commons. While all the rest of the details above are still negotiable, I spoke with a developer who says that the image thing can't be fixed without deleting everything. I suggest, therefore, that all images that need to be saved should be uploaded to commons instead. Commons will temporarily be accepting fair use images, because Wikipedia does and commons is going to be merged into Wikipedia. 

Because it's a last ditch emergency, details are few and things are going to be happening quickly in the next few days. I'll try to dig up a link once something official is written up and posted. I know the WMF is working on a press release, and the developers have been working overtime to get these issues solved. I'll post more information as I get it. This isn't an ideal situation for us, but if it means that all our books don't need to get deleted, I think we just have to deal with it for now. In the future, the developers say that we will be able to separate the projects again by creating new databases and using a fleet of page import bots to move pages around. Let's all hope that this happens sooner, rather then later.

== Gallery Colouring Problem ==

I have problems applying a background style rule within the Gallery tag.   Although many of the font and text styles can be modified, the eg; &lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:dimgray&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; rule, will only colour the padding area, and not the topmost area, the off-white photo mask.

Does anybody know how this can be done for a gallery within Wikitext?   In the event that it is not available, it might be an idea to suggest it for a possible modification.

Thanks in advance for any useful suggestions,

== New book: SQL Exercises ==

Hi everyone! Just wanted to introduce myself: My name is Borja Sotomayor and I am currently working on adding a new wikibook titled &quot;[[SQL Exercises]]&quot;. I have lectured on databases in the past, and I'm doing it again this year, so I thought a wikibook would be a good way of sharing my collection of SQL exercises not just with my students but with anyone who might find them useful (for avoidance of doubt, the exercises are all written by me and none are taken from existing books). This book could be used as a complementary textbook in a database course, or by anyone who wants to take a quick look at SQL code.

Right now, I'm just working on converting my exercises to wikitext (see [[SQL Exercises/The computer store|this page]] for an example of what the exercises will look like). Once I'm done doing that, I hope to extend the book to include commentaries in some of the solutions, a quick guide to doing  the exercises with SQLite, creating a Development page for other people to easily suggest exercises, etc.

[[User:Borjasotomayor|borja]] ([[User talk:Borjasotomayor|talk]]) 20:59, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

:Hello Borja, welcome to Wikibooks! Your book is looking great so far, and is a really great idea. The exercises also look excellent and very valuable for students. We already have two related books, [[SQL]] and [[MySQL]], both of which are in need of help. Rather then having a book that is just devoted to exercises, maybe these pages could become the &quot;Exercise Sections&quot; of the [[SQL]] book? That way, you could keep the problems that students work on close to the written book material. The caveat is, of course, that the [[SQL]] book is in very bad condition right now, and would need to be cleaned up before you could add things to it constructively. Maybe I'll go through it and see if I can clean it up a little bit first. Anyway, I dont think this is a big deal, it's just a suggestion.

::I did actually take a look at the [[SQL]] and [[MySQL]] books, and came to the same conclusion (that they still need some work). Regardless, I personally favor having the [[SQL Exercises]] as a separate book. This is not for any territorial reasons; from a teaching standpoint, database instructors sometimes just want a collection of SQL exercises that are not tied to any particular book or DBMS so they can distribute them to their students as complementary material that they can use to practice on their own (although the exercises are currently tied to SQLite, I want to eventually go through the SQL code and make sure that it works out-of-the-box on most major DBMSs). This is not to say that the exercise book and an [[SQL]] wikibook would be completely separate entities. I'm all for cross-referencing between the two books (e.g., &quot;This exercise depends on FULL RIGHT JOINs, which are explained in ((link to pertinent section in SQL book))&quot;).

:::That's fine too! New authors don't always know all the possibilities and options available, so I try to point them out.

== Redirects occupying the main namespace ==

Books like [[Scheveningen_variation]] and [[Sicilian_Dragon]] have recently been created.  They serve only as redirects to pages within the [[Opening theory in chess]] book.  Is this allowed?  Doesn't having lots of 'empty' books on Wikibooks artifically push up our tally of the number of books we have?  Doesn't this make the main namespace look messier? --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:45, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

: I think such redirects are generally frowned on. Wikibooks does not encourage disambiguous pages or unnecessary redirects. Yes I think it makes the main namespace look messier. Since they are intended to be part of a book, at the very lest they should be called ''Opening theory in chess/Scheveningen variation'' and ''Opening theory in chess/Sicilian Dragon''. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:53, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

:: I think that would be a good proposal Darklama.

:I recently created those redirects for ease of use and ease of remembering as well as ease of finding for anyone that might be searching for the term of simply entering it and hitting go. They could change as Darklama suggested although that makes it messy for me and every editor who wants to use the term because you can no longer use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Scheveningen variation]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and instead use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Opening theory in chess/Scheveningen variation|Scheveningen variation]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
:I read on wikipedia that redirects are not a resource issue and indeed there are many on wikipedia in the mainspace, deliberately so I think so that anyone can easily find things, sorry if the case is not the same on wikibooks. Was not aware.

The &quot;../&quot; makes the link relative to the parent page. Likewise, if you are deep in the book, you could use &quot;../../../&quot; and so on to get back to the root page.

== ControlTheoryPro.com ==

I'm a new user who works pointing controls on satellites.  Controls and artificial intelligence are my geek hobbies.  The Controls wikibook on this site is pretty good for theory but I still find myself looking sites with a much broad and expansive list of topics so I've create a wiki on controls at [http://wikis.ControlTheoryPro.com wikis.ControlTheoryPro.com].  I work full time and site is very new.  So I'm cherry picking the easy stuff like quick pages on MATLAB commands for my site content as well as updates to MATLAB Programming wikibook.  As the site matures and I get some help from other authors I'll dive more deeply into examples and finally theory (since a lot of the theory articles would duplicate what's already in the Controls wikibook).

That said, if someone has a passion for controls and wants to contribute I would appreciate any help I can get.  Whether that help is writting theory articles or examples or MATLAB.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

ControlTheoryPro.com also has a forum.  There are controls groups out there and they aren't bad.  But they seem to suffer from a lot of spam postings and what seems to be a dwindling of interest.  I use anti-spam tools to keep the spam off.  I'll see how well they work.

== [[Template:Bigwelcome]] ==

This is a potential replacement for our current welcome template, which I find is sparse. This one is based off the Commons welcome template, and I tried to make sure the most frequent queries I get on my talk page are mentioned, since our current system is obviously not addressing certain issues that it should be. Please feel free to comment on the talk page. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:44, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

:The current {{tlx|welcome}} template was basically an attempt to make something that was &quot;short and sweet&quot;, a backlash against the huge and rambling previous template. I'm really of the philosophy that people aren't going to read too much, and it's not worthwhile to put tons and tons of information on a users talk page if they aren't going to read it all. Plus, much of the information that we put there isn't going to apply to all readers, and we don't want to drown people under piles of stuff they won't need. 
:That said, I do like this approach if we absolutely need to be more verbose. Keeping sections labeled and color coded can help to keep reader's attention focused on the sections they actually need. If we do decide to go with this kind of template, I think I would like to tweak some of the information that's there. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:11, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
::Well, yes, the previous version of {{tlx|welcome}} was too large, and mostly unhelpful. But I keep seeing the same queries over and over again on my talk page, other admins' talk pages, in the reading room, and in IRC, so clearly these are things which are worthy of inclusion. They're not being addressed adequately, and the welcome message is one place to fix that. Next on my list will be the [[Help:FAQ|FAQs]] and [[Help:Contents]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:40, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:::I can agree with you about that much, there are a lot of common questions that don't get answered satisfactorily. I'm not entirely sure I agree that the welcome template is the best place to do this, but then again I won't disagree with it either. I personally say we work on the FAQs first, and then take the most pertinent questions from those and put them into the welcome template. Of course, a big link to &quot;FAQS OVER HERE!&quot; with all the answers might be good too. It's just a matter of structuring things so that readers actually click the link, instead of glazing over it. If you want to overhaul the welcome template, i certainly won't stop you. Like i said, I might want to tweak it a little bit, but that's a small issue. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:05, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

&quot;I would just like to say that I am extremely grateful for these pages. I can't afford any chess books (I don't get allowance or get paid for any chores by my parents) so the only resource I have is the internet through the library. I don't know how many people have thanked you all for taking the trouble to post this information up, but I'd like to just be another person to tell you that I've been reading all of this! I just hope that some wiki mod doesn't show up and delete the pages saying it's too much information, because I've seen articles cut down a lot because of it. Anyway, you guys can just delete this after a bit, but I just wanted to give a thank you because this is the best!&quot;

== Character creation textbook ==

Today I found a wikibook called [[Character creation]]. It seems to be abandoned. Should we work on fixing it up? Compare its coverage of character development with [[Writing Adolescent Fiction]].

== How changing the name of an article? ==

I would like to rename ‘Communication Theory/Sociological Systems’ to ‘Communication Theory and Social Systems’ as the former includes a mistake.  It could also be named ‘… Sociological Systems Theory’ since the respective sociological approach offers a Theory in the framework of communication theory) but ‚Social Systems’ – that’s what the theories and this article are about.  It is not about systems that are merely sociological or depending on sociological research (that would be a misunderstanding of the theories involved), it is about systems in the real world (such as politics, law, art, organisations, etc.). Hence, ‚… Social Systems’ would currently be appropriate (as well as short and sweet).

::What mistake does the current name include? I'm not understanding what you believe is wrong with the current name. Perhaps you are misinterpreting the page name? [[Communication Theory]] is a name of a book, in which [[Communication Theory/Sociological Systems|Sociological Systems]] is a chapter of that book. You can read Wikibooks' [[WB:NP|naming policy]] to learn about it the convention used here. Basically this means that the Sociological Systems chapter is intended to focus on Sociological Systems as it apples to Communication Theory. Another book might explain Sociological Systems from a different perspective, or a book could exist that focuses on just Sociological Systems with more depth and all the different uses of Sociological Systems. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:37, 23 April 2008 (UTC)

== Translusion limit? ==

Hello =) .Is there a limit to the depth of the translusion of pages. In [[C++ Programming]] when you try to do

&lt;pre&gt;
{{:C++ Programming/All Chapters}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

on the print version it just gives a link to the page instead of transcluding the page, and so currently the code from [[C++ Programming/All Chapters]] is just copied into the code for the [[C++ Programming/Print version|print version]]. [[C++ Programming/All Chapters]] is made up of transcluded pages which are themselves made up of transcluded pages, so is the limit to transclusion 2 levels deep, or 3 levels if you count the templates being included on the individual pages? Or is this just something that has been done wrong in one of the pages that would stop this? [[User:Ikarsik|rawrawrer]] ([[User talk:Ikarsik|talk]]) 09:28, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

== Stable Versions BETA Test ==

Erik Moeller sent a [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2008-March/001237.html message to textbook-l] about final tests for the stable versions extension that is going to be added to our software eventually. He noted a few things that we as a community need to decide upon before that extension can be implemented here. For ease of testing, the [http://en.labs.wikimedia.org/ test servers use the Wikibooks database] since it's smaller then the Wikipedia one. That means that we wikibookians should be relatively at-home with these tests.

We as a community need to decide a few things about this extension and reach concensus on its use before it's activated here. It apparently has many options which can be set and changed, depending on our needs. Here are some examples of things we need to decide:

#do we want this at all?
#What page ratings do we want to have? These can be things like &quot;unchecked&quot;, &quot;unapproved&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;featured&quot;, &quot;decent&quot;, &quot;garbage&quot;, &quot;stable&quot;, whatever we want.
#Who should be permitted to flag articles as being of a particular quality level? Admins and bcrats will likely have the ability by default. Do we also want to let our rollbacker/patrollers do this? Maybe this is something that all registered users could do?
#When a reader (a logged-out user) visits a page, should they see the current working draft by default, or should they see the last approved version by default? In either case there will be a link in the upper-right corner to take the reader to either the current working draft, or the current quality version. I'm pretty sure that logged-in users will always see the current working draft, by default.

I've got a few suggestions on these, but I want to see some feedback from others before i go preaching about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:54, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

:# Yes we want it.
:# Unless someone comes up with some better ideas, I think the page ratings should be &quot;new&quot;, &quot;abandoned&quot;, &quot;redo&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;, &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;featured&quot;, to coincide with new pages/books, pages/books which have been abandoned and need work, pages/books which need work, pages/books which are useful but not necessarily stable, pages/books which are stable, and books which are featured.

:Regarding patrollers and flaggedrevs... diff patrolling is rendered obsolete by flaggedrevs, as any sighted (or higher) version is marked as patrolled. So you'd want the usergroups 'patroller' and 'editor' to have the same permissions (or simply retire 'patroller' and replace it with 'editor'). But Wikibooks doesn't have diff patrolling; we have new page patrolling, and the documentation is currently unclear as to what effect there will be. I will try to figure this out shortly, but I suspect that the same will be true for wikis with new page patrolling. We'll want to retire the 'patroller' permission, and use 'editor' instead. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:23, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

:I am very excited about this extension as it lets us truly have editor review of our book projects. I personally will only use one flag on book pages, whatever it would be called, to mark that revision as being stable for book inclusion. This revision would then be included for PDF and printable version export. Dealing with other levels to me is just a waste of time and overcomplicated. Ideally I would want to be able to give access to certain users on a book level, but since that's not likely possible I think we should have rather tight control on this; I definitely don't want any registered user marking Muggles' Guide revisions as stable and will only permit myself and a small circle of trusted editors. I am thinking users should only see stable versions by default. Each active book editor should be tasked with flagging their book and if no active editor is available then I think we can use the most current revision as stable. In any case, the initial enabling of this extension will likely mark the current revision as some sort of stable version anyway. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:23, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
::I agree that we don't want a cumbersome set of validation levels. IMO, it'd be ideal if we can keep &quot;patrolled&quot; as-is: for [[WB:NPP|new page patrolling]] and nothing more. On top of that, we can have FlaggedRevs with &quot;stable&quot; (for book inclusion, as described by withinfocus) and &quot;featured&quot; for [[WB:FB|featured books]]. Anything more complicated than that is likely to be too big a burden to maintain. When there is a stable or featured revision, it should be shown by default to unregistered users. Admins will have reviewer permissions by default. If we're not using &quot;sighted&quot; as a quality level (use &quot;patrolled&quot; instead) then we don't need the &quot;editor&quot; permission.
::Alternatively, we could depreciate the &quot;patrolled&quot; status and make our patrollers into editors. If we do that, I'd want admins (reviewers) to give users the editor permission. The upside of using editor/sighted instead of patroller/patrolled is that we can vet pages of any age, not simply recently-created pages. However, I don't know that there is a way to list recent pages which haven't been sighted, which would be a problem. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:31, 19 April 2008 (UTC)

:That's a strange error, and I have to admit that I've never seen it before. My suggestion to you is to change your email address and try to confirm that way. Or, change it and then change it back to try and &quot;reset&quot; the values stored in the software. 
:When you get the confirmation email, make sure you copy+paste the entire URL into the browser. Sometimes when you click on a long link in an email, URLs can be separated up and not loaded correctly.

== [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Feature requests|Feature Requests Chatroom]] ==

we were talking with some developers on IRC yesterday, working on some of our &quot;wishlist&quot; development items that we had discussed in the past. It came to light that while there are many things that we Wikibookians seem to want, we don't really have a single, codified vision for what kinds of features we want to see in the software around here. Without a unified vision, it's difficult to make decisions in the short-term because we don't know if decisions we make now will be helpful in pursuing our long-term goals. 

To that end, we've created a chatroom at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Feature requests]]. What we want to do is, as a community, lay out a comprehensive list of all the features that we do want in the software here, and the relative importance of each. Ideally, we can start approaching some of the big items incrementally, and satisfy some of the smaller items along the way. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:14, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

== wikibook functionality with plain mediawiki ==

Hi, I'm at a site that has mediawiki installed and I have a book I'd like to put on that wiki. I don't have any special privileges and I'd like to structure my wiki entries like books are here on wikibooks (i.e hierarchically w/chapters etc).

I suppose it's impossible for me to do that, but I wonder if others have tried using the normal mediawiki functions like categories and navigation tools/templates to get something like a book structure.

I'm just learning this stuff and thought I'd ask here since I'm sure some of you must have given this a lot of thought! Thanks --[[User:A jtim|A jtim]] ([[User talk:A jtim|talk]]) 19:45, 22 April 2008 (UTC)
:Hi there! Wikibooks is using ''almost'' vanilla MediaWiki - we have a few extensions installed, but they're largely the same one every other project has. You shouldn't need anything special to get a book structure... in fact, there isn't any. If you want to use subpages, you need to have the software [[mw:Manual:$wgNamespacesWithSubpages|configured]] to do that. But even without subpages in the mainspace enabled, you can still have a good book structure. If you see the [[#Feature Requests Chatroom|section above]], it points to a new discussion area where we're trying to figure out what changes to make to the software in order to handle books better (after all, the MediaWiki software was written for Wikipedia originally). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:46, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Two points: First, we're slowly phasing out the bookshelves, so eventually we won't be using them at all. Changes that you make to the bookshelves are only short-lived, and therefore unimportant. You should feel free to change them as you see fit. 
:::What we are slowly moving towards are the Subject pages, which are similar to bookshelves but more general and automatically-updated. See, for instance, [[Subject:Mathematics]]. A better long-term solution is to categorize books properly, and create new subject pages for the different subsets of mathematics. If you could give me a good comprehensive plan about how to organize all our existing books, I could handle the implementation for you.
:::As for the [[Topology]] book: If you think it would be better to split it into two books, that should be fine too. We can create a [[Subject:Topology]] to link to the new books.

== GFDL ==

Ok. There are some complications with GFDL.

Pursuant to the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|Text of the GNU Free Documentation License]]:

:&quot;''The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License ...''&quot;

and reusers are obliged to

:&quot;''Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers''&quot;

Use of the disclaimer is problematic because it adds an additional restriction which we are obligated to preserve per GFDL license itself.

[[Template:GFDL]] on en.wikibooks have underwent several changes.

Notable changes from a legal standpoint are:

*[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:GFDL&amp;oldid=43748 04:42, 16 July 2004] version by Guanaco. Links to a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikipedia:general disclaimer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; which links to the article on English wikipedia about disclaimers in general. There is still an indirect link to the general English wikipedia license on the linked page.
*By [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AGFDL&amp;diff=132653&amp;oldid=43748 04:51, 16 July 2004] Guanaco corrected the little error by changing the disclaimer link to [[Wikibooks:general disclaimer]]. 
*On [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AGFDL&amp;diff=162866&amp;oldid=132653 09:44, 26 May 2005] a User142 has altered the license template copying the one from English wikipedia. This page linked to the article on disclaimers in general. There is still an indirect link to the general English wikipedia license on the linked page.
*On [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AGFDL&amp;diff=324916&amp;oldid=162866 01:14, 2 January 2006] Kernigh unintentionally removed the disclaimer by copying the commons template.
*No disclaimer had been introduced since.

So... 
*all uses of the license from 04:42 to 04:51, 16 July 2004 should use [[Template:GFDL]] with English wikipedia's disclaimer or the wikipedia article on disclaimers in general. (I seriously doubt anything got uploaded in that 9 minutes)
*all uses of the license from 04:51, 16 July 2004 to 09:44, 26 May 2005 should use [[Template:GFDL]] with English wikibooks' disclaimer.
*all uses of the license from 09:44, 26 May 2005 to 01:14, 2 January 2006 should use [[Template:GFDL]] with English wikipedia's disclaimer or the wikipedia article on disclaimers in general.

The issue with English wikipedia is complicated and I do not know how it would go in a court. Never the less all uses of the GFDL template between 04:42, 16 July 2004 to 01:14, 2 January 2006 have had some sort of a disclaimer and should be retagged accordingly.

:This is all well and good, and I understand the legal issues here. However, unless you can suggest a way to find the times that all images were tagged with {{tlx|GFDL}} automatically, there is no reasonable way that we can fix this issue. Further, I would suggest that all pages have always been linked to our [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer]], because a link to that exists in site footer. Whether the disclaimer link is preserved in the text of the GFDL declaration, or whether it is linked at the bottom of every content page should be irrelevant. The GFDL says only that we must preserve all disclaimers, not that we must preserve the way in which those disclaimers are referenced. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:00, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

I'm reviving [[FHSST Biology]], and I just wanted to let everyone know.  I'd be very grateful for help.  [[General Biology]] has some good parts, but it is aimed at an older audience (as I can see from the notes).  I'm hoping some of you guys will add to the book.

:We usually call it &quot;adopting&quot; as opposed to &quot;reviving&quot;. However you refer to it, choosing to fix up an old and abandoned book is always appreciated! The &quot;FHSST&quot; stood for &quot;Free High School Science Texts&quot;, and I think (but can't remember the details) that these books were affiliated with some kind of external organization. If you would like to rename this book to something else, like &quot;Introduction to Biology&quot;, or &quot;High School Biology&quot;, or &quot;Biology for Beginners&quot;, or whatever, feel free to do it.

== Updating Policy, Guidelines, Help Pages, etc ==

I've created a new template, {{tlx|Update}} that we can use to tag pages which are out of date or are not accurate anymore. This can, like all other message templates, be used on books. However, It can (and should) also be used to mark metapages like those found in the Wikibooks: and Help: namespaces, templates (templates which need an aesthetic overhaul, or out of date template documentation), or Category: pages. Hell, we could even throw it on old images that were drawn in mspaint and need to be redone using a better editor. If we have a good comprehensive list of pages that are known to need updating, we can make a concerted effort to fix them.

If you see pages that are not accurate anymore or that need to be updated, please tag them with {{tlx|Update}}. This will put pages into [[:Category:Pages needing update]], and we can go through that list like any other normal maintenance task. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:01, 29 April 2008 (UTC)

&quot;Sandwich cake&quot; (&quot;Sandwich layer-cake&quot; is rather the English description than a translation of the name) is a typical Swedish party dish, not to be confused with Smörgåsbord. The sandwich cake is a very rich sandwich with so much filling it resembles a cake. The sandwich cake is excellent for receptions and parties since it is served cold and can be prepared in advance. It is also possible to have great variation in the fillings to accompany most peoples taste. The dish can be served as a cake or in smaller piece as appetizers.

==Ingredients==
The ingredients listed are for shrimp and egg filling. This is only one of many variants, other variants are provided at the end of the recipe.

* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]] (with shell)
* 4.5 dl (450ml) (1 US pint) [[Cookbook:Cottage_Cheese|cottage cheese]]
* 4 dl (400ml) [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* 1 dl (100ml) [[Cookbook:Sour_Cream|sour cream]]
* 2 loaves white [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|Black pepper]]
* Sprigs of [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]] or slices of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] or [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] for garnish
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]] or [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] for garnish

== Procedure ==
[[Image:sandwich-cake-1.jpg|thumbnail|Spread the filling on the toast.]]
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:sandwich-cake-2.jpg|thumbnail|After covering the top with mayonnaise, fix the pieces with a tooth-pick and cut to serving size using a sharp knife.]] --&gt;
[[Image:sandwich-cake-3.jpg|thumbnail|Garnish and serve.]]

# Boil the eggs until hard and peel the shrimp. Set aside some shrimp (about one third) for garnishing. Chop the remaining shrimp, which will be used for filling. This first step is only required for the shrimp and egg filling variant.
# Mix 1 dl mayonnaise with 1 dl sour cream in a cup or bowl, place in the refrigerator. Mix the remaining mayonnaise and cottage cheese in another bowl together with the chopped shrimp; this is the ''filling''. Cut the bread ''lengthwise'' to make eight 1 cm thick slices. Do not use the top and bottom slice. Place two slices next to each other, preferably on a cutting board. Spread one third of the filling on top of the bread slices. Add two more bread slices on top. Spread half of the remaining filling and repeat for the final layer. The cake should now have four layers of bread with three layers of filling between them.
# If necessary even out the edges of the cake with a sharp knife. Take the mayonnaise/sour cream mix out of the refrigerator and spread it thinly and evenly on the sides of and on top of the cake. Cover the sides of the cake with chopped parsley or dill. Garnish with shrimp, sliced eggs and dill sprigs or lemon slices.

=== Appetizer style ===
When preparing the sandwich cake in &quot;appetizer style&quot; do not cut the bread lengthwise, instead cut normal slices. It is also possible to use pre-sliced bread. Only use two layers for the appetizers and use a tooth-pick to hold it together.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
The recipe above describes a four layer cake with only one type of filling. It is possible to use different fillings in different layers of the cake. However, make sure that the tastes of the fillings &quot;fit&quot; together. It is also possible to do a three layer cake.

Instead of serving the sandwich cake in cake form it is possible to cut it into pieces before serving. This makes an excellent appetizer or it can be more convenient way to serve the cake since guests do not have to cut it.

Since the sandwich cake can be quite heavy it is usually served with a mixed salad. Tortilla chips of various kinds of nuts or almonds (roasted or fresh) can also be served on the side.

=== Additional Fillings ===
The basic filling consists of about 50/50 mayonnaise and cottage cheese. The proportions can be varied by taste. For a low fat version use more cottage cheese and/or substitute the mayonnaise for low-fat (do not use non-fat) mayonnaise. Different flavorings can be added to the basic filling, some examples follows.

* Chopped tuna
* Chopped pate and pickled cucumber
* Smoked ham and paprika
* Eggs, pickled cucumber and curry

==3. Nf3==

White position is quite sharp, an attack on the e5 pawn, a possible break on d4 would gain a tempo on the Black Bishop. Black has one one move to try for equality, that's 3...Nc6 and transpose into the Giuoco Piano.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=ETS local data storage=

ETS is the Erlang table storage system, which provides hash-based data storage and access functions. These functions run in constant time.  ETS data is stored in a process as long as it is running.

Here is an example of how to use some simple functions in ETS.  Notice that the table is not square because goofy has no last name.

==Sample program: test_ets.erl==

 -module(test_ets).
 -compile(export_all).
 
 start() -&gt; start( mouse ).
 
 start( Animal ) -&gt;
 	Kingdom = ets:new( 'magic',  [] ),
 	% note: table is not square
 	populate( Kingdom, [{micky,mouse}, {mini,mouse}, {goofy}] ),
 	Member = ets:member( Kingdom, micky ),
 	io:format( &quot; member ~w ~n &quot;, [ Member ] ),
 	show_next_key( Kingdom, micky ),
 	find_animal( Kingdom, Animal ).
 	
 show_next_key( _Kingdom, '$end_of_table' ) -&gt; done;
 show_next_key( Kingdom,  Key) -&gt;
 	Next = ets:next( Kingdom, Key ),
 	io:format( &quot; next ~w ~n &quot;, [ Next ] ),
 	show_next_key( Kingdom, Next ).
 
 populate( _Kingdom, [] ) -&gt; {done,start};
 populate( Kingdom, [H | T] ) -&gt;
 		ets:insert( Kingdom, H ),
 		populate( Kingdom, T ).
 	
 find_animal( Kingdom, Animal ) -&gt;
 	ets:match( Kingdom, { '$1', Animal } ).
	
 % ==============
 % sample output
 % ==============
 % 53&gt; test_ets:start().
 % member true 
 %  next mini 
 %  next goofy 
 %  next '$end_of_table' 
 %  [[mini],[micky]]

My ''real'' name is Daniel Victor.  I'm from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am the Master Guide Instructor of the Sunway Pathfinder Club based in Sungai Way Indian Church.  I've been Pathfindering from the age of 8. Over the time I've been up and down in the Pathfinder ministry but by God's grace I'm who I am now. 

I almost gone on a way too far from God in which it was utterly impossible to make a U turn but as I said earlier, God grace is ever enduring. He gave me a second chance and the One thing that made me come back was something I learned when I was little, thats is Pathfindering. This was what hooked up me to make a come back. Again by God's grace I'm now completely involved in church activities and guiding and encouraging youths to join Pathfinder. There is much to learn and enjoy. Currently, I also hold the responsibility as a church clerk in Sungai Way Indian Church. 

Apart from Pathfindering and church ministry, I'm working as Procurement Staff in Motorola Electronics. I studied Computer Science as IT &amp; computers has always been my passion. Although somehow, its not related to my job scope but I never stopped updating myself on the latest technology updates.

I started on wikibooks by updating  the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]]. I'm really glad that I could be part of this wonderful book which I belive would be the source of guidance for all the Pathfinders and their Instructors.

==Dictionary==
Data can be stored in many ways in Erlang. Each process has a local dictionary that uses put and get.
 2&gt; put(hello,world).  
 undefined
 3&gt; get(hello).
 world
==ETS==
Data can be stored with the ETS (Erlang table storage system) via the ETS library. It creates data at the process level. See [[Erlang_Programming/Using_ets|Using_Ets]].

==Mnesia==
[[Mnesia]] is a distributed database that lives in the local file system.

==External Databases==

      <text xml:space="preserve">= TEKEY$ =
=== Function ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
char$ = TEKEY$ 
=== Description ===
If there is an active edit field in the current window, and you have designated an edit-event handling routine using the ON EDIT statement, TEKEY$ returns a 1-character string indicating a key that the user pressed. You should check the value of TEKEY$ within your edit-event handling routine, each time that routine is called. When you use an edit-event handling routine, the user's keystrokes are not transmitted directly to the edit field. Based on the value returned by TEKEY$, your edit-event handling routine can decide what to do with the keypress; it can transmit it to the field unaltered, or transmit a different character, or perform some other action. Your routine can use the TEKEY$ statement to transmit the keypress (or some other character) to the edit field, if desired. TEKEY$ values that correspond to the backspace key, and the four arrow keys should generally be transmitted to the field unaltered. Note that any keypresses that can't alter the contents of the field nor move the insertion point are generally not reported to your edit-event handling routine. Keypresses that will not be reported include the following:

*Arrow keys, if the insertion point is already as far as it can go in the indicated direction (use the DIALOG function (event types _efLeftArrow, _efRightArrow, _efUpArrow and _efDownArrow) to detect arrow keys in this situation);
*Command-key equivalents for menu items;
*Command-period.
*The &quot;Tab&quot; key (use the DIALOG function (event type _efTab or _efShiftTab))The &quot;Clear&quot; key (use *DIALOG function (event type _efClear));
*The &quot;Return&quot; key, if the field is one of the &quot;NoCR&quot; types (use the DIALOG function (event type _efReturn));

      <text xml:space="preserve">= TEXT =
=== Statement ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
TEXT [font%][,[size%][,[face%][,copyMode%]]] 
=== Description === 
This statement sets the text characteristics for the current 
output window or printer. It affects subsequent PRINT statements 
(in the current window or printer), subsequent LPRINT statements, and 
subsequently-created edit fields (in the current window). It does not change the
appearance of any existing text, except in buttons created using the _useWFont 
type modifier (see the BUTTON statement). Each of the parameters is optional. 
If you omit a parameter, the corresponding characteristic won't be changed. The 
parameters are interpreted as follows: font%
A number which identifies the font family. Certain common fonts have standard 
numbers which are identified by these constants: _newYork_venice_geneva
_monaco_times_helvetica
_courier_symbol The following constants are also available: _sysFont (System font; usually Chicago or Charcoal)
_applFont (Default application font; usually Geneva) For other fonts, the best 
way to determine the font number is to pass the font's name to the GETFNUM 
Toolbox procedure, as here:    CALL GETFNUM(fontName$, font%) When you do this, 
the font's number is returned in the font% variable, which you can then pass to
the TEXT statement. size%
The font size, in points. This usually gives some indication of the height in 
pixels of the tallest character; however, you shouldn't rely on this. Use the 
USR FONTHEIGHT function to determine the pixel height of a line of text. * face%
The text style. To set the face to &quot;plain,&quot; set this parameter to zero; 
otherwise, you can
set it to the sum of any of the following bitmask values: _boldBit%_outlineBit%
_italicBit%_shadowBit%
_ulineBit%_condenseBit%
_extendBit% Example:    TEXT _geneva, 12, _boldBit% + _italicBit% copyMode%
This determines how the text interacts with the existing background. The most 
commonly used values are _srcCopy (the entire character's rectangle replaces 
the background), and _srcOr (only the character's glyph replaces the background).
Other transfer modes include: _srcXor_addOver
_srcBic_subPin
_notSrcCopy_transparent
_notSrcOr_adMax
_notSrcXor_subOver
_notSrcBic_adMin
_blend_grayishTextOr
_addPin_ditherCopy(mask) See the &quot;QuickDraw Text&quot; chapter in Inside Macintosh: Text, and the chapters &quot;QuickDraw Drawing&quot; and &quot;Color QuickDraw&quot; in Inside Macintosh: Imaging with QuickDraw, for more information about text transfer modes. Note:
Each screen window maintains its own text characteristics separately from the others. The TEXT statement affects only the characteristics in the current window. To change the characteristics of text in existing edit fields, use the EDIT TEXT statement. To change the color of subsequently printed text, use the COLOR or LONG COLOR statement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= THREADBEGIN =
=== Statement ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
THREADBEGIN FN name [, parameter&amp; [, stackMin&amp;]] === Revised === August, 2002 (Release 7) 
=== Description ===
What exactly is a thread? It is a function that performs a task. The difference between a threaded function and any other function is that the threaded version runs in the background. Your program (and other running processes) advance without interruption as the threaded task is performed. There are many reasons for using threaded functions. One that is becoming popular relates to functions that access Internet connections. Since logging in and downloading often take a good bit of time, it makes sense to hand such a task to a threaded function and go on about your business. You might handle other tasks like complex calculations, lengthy sorts, or time-consuming file loads. When a threaded function is called, it executes without stopping until it is complete -- just like any other function. But at some point inside of the function, you yield to other processes by calling THREADSTATUS. The THREADSTATUS statement allows other actions to take place and optionally sets a timed delay for the number of ticks that should elapse before your function regains control. The parameter passed to a thread may be any long integer required by your program. It is for your use. If a parameter is sent, you should accept it in the named local function. For instance, if a parameter were used in the example below, we would create the function with LOCAL FN myThread(param AS LONG) instead of just plain LOCAL FN myThread. If the stackMin parameter is omitted, FutureBASIC sets a minimum stack space of 131072 bytes (128K). You may experiment with larger or smaller values for your specific needs. Example:
This simple example creates a thread that prints a string of text, piece by piece, in a FOR/NEXT loop. The THREADSTATUS call installs a callback time of 10 ticks which makes the text appear slowly. You can type into the edit field as the threaded text is placed on the screen. LOCAL FN myThread
&lt;pre&gt;   
DIM t$,x, abort
   t$ = &quot;Hello. I am a thread. &quot;
   t$ += &quot;I execute in the background.&quot;
   FOR X = 1 TO LEN(t$)
PRINT @(1,1) LEFT$(t$,x);
abort = THREADSTATUS(10)//call me in 10 ticks
IF abort != 0 THEN EXIT FN
   NEXT
END FN WINDOW 1
TEXT _sysfont,12,0,0
PRINT@(1,3)&quot;Type into the edit field&quot;
EDIT FIELD 1,&quot;&quot;,(8,80)-(200,100)
THREADBEGIN FN myThread
DO
   HANDLEEVENTS
UNTIL 0
&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;THE ABOVE SECTION IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND STILL NEEDS FIXING!!!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Deus ex Machina'' is a technique used primarily in drama but not limited to the stage; translated, it means: &quot;God out of the Machine&quot;.  A ''deus ex machina'' ending to a play or book is when the plot builds up so hopelessly and dramatically that it seems that it cannot be resolved by any means, only for a sudden improbably solution to appear.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.



:Hello! And ようこそ to Wikibooks! Thanks a lot for your contribution on the [[Japanese/Mini-tutorial_lesson|Japanese Mini-tutorial]]. Hope you will keep an eye on this page (and other Japanese lessons). Since I am not a native speaker, I miss a lot and make mistakes here and there. Maybe, if you haven't done so already, you want to make an account? どうもありがとうございました。　がんばって　下さい。　[[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[Talk_User:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 17:11, 18 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

Welcome to the '''Proposals reading room'''. On this page, Wikibookians are free to talk about suggestions for improving Wikibooks.

== Sharing ==

It dawned on me earlier that Wikibooks is one of the few websites which I regularly use which doesn't include buttons for sharing pages (books) with various social networks.  Digging around showed that this had been discussed many times before on W'pedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_87#Share_button here] but has such a proposal taken place in Wikibooks?  I've read the arguments against the idea and understand how it might promote certain other websites and so on but when more and more traffic is coming from mobile devices it seems like the obvious way forward.  Copying and pasting a URL and then switching to a VK or Facebook app to post the link is quite a chore on a mobile device.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:16, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

: [[n:Template:Social bookmarks]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:49, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
: With that precedent in mind, I think it's an interesting idea; but, where would you envision putting the share buttons?  For example, if we wanted them per-book, and at the bottom of the book's main page, we could add them to template {{tl|subjects}} (with some care, since there might be some books that don't put {{tl|subjects}} in the standard place).  Sharing per-book makes a certain amount of sense to me, because the point of our project is the books as coherent units, rather than just collections of pages (which is Wikipedia's turf).  On the other hand, there ''are'' times when a particular page is of interest, and very much so in the Cookbook subproject.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:21, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::I'd say that share buttons at the foot of the page would be the best idea.  The buttons would be for sharing the whole book with the exception of Cookbook pages.  But what are the negatives of doing this?  I don't fully understand why Wikipedia rejected it - it seems like an obvious idea to me but it seems to have been repeatedly shot down.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:12, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
:::Well, bluntly, the Wikipedian community plays headgames with itself.  They have this virulently anti-elitist tradition, yet in openly acknowledging they aren't themselves a reliable source they nurse an inferiority complex that compels them to put on the trappings of elitism.  Share-links would be ''plebian''.
:::(I choose to believe Wikipedia isn't beyond redemption.  I do.  But I think they've gotten themselves into a hole they can't dig themselves out of; it's going to be up to their sister projects to succeed and show them how it can be done.  Not a short-term goal, but one I think worth striving for.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 19:51, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::::I'd welcome it being made easier to socially share Wikibooks content, especially on mobile devices: it might go some way to addressing the disparity between Wikibooks' quality and how well known it is. On the &quot;per-book&quot; versus &quot;per-page&quot; issue, I request that avoid paternalism and put as much as possible in the hands of the user. This fits with the Wikimedia ethos of content freely reusable by anyone for any purpose. Say I find the page [[Communication_Theory/Uncertainty_Reduction]] and want to share it with colleagues or students: I'd hope the page itself would be shared, not the entire book on the assumption that the book is intended as a coherent unit. Leave it to the user to share what they think is worth sharing, rather than deciding on their behalf.

== Archiving ==

Is it easy to change the frequency of archiving for the various Reading Rooms.  Wikibooks (or at least the Reading Rooms) is a lot less active than in the past and it's a pain returning after a break to have to plough through all of the various archives.  Seems to be archiving everything after 21 days of no activity - would it be feasible to change this to 45 or 60 days?  Also noticed that [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives]] didn't have lists for 2013 so I've added them.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:42, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
: Each page should have a template call at the top to {{tl|User:MiszaBot/config}}.  One of the parameters is&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|1=algo = old(21d)}}&amp;nbsp; which can presumably be changed from 21 to 45 or 60 with the desired efect.  I'd be okay with 60.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:24, 18 March 2014 (UTC)
: Great so it's that simple.  I'll give it a go some time. Thanks.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:44, 18 March 2014 (UTC)
: Done. Now 50 days. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:07, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|

}}

The acos() function returns the arc cosine of ''arg'', which will be in the range [0, pi]. ''arg'' should be between -1 and 1. If ''arg'' is outside this range, acos() returns NAN and raises a floating-point exception.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|

The asin() function returns the arc sine of ''arg'', which will be in the range [-pi/2, +pi/2]. ''arg'' should be between -1 and 1. If ''arg'' is outside this range, asin() returns NAN and raises a floating-point exception.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Cell arrays are created just like regular arrays except that curly brackets are used instead of square brackets.
  array = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
  cell_array = {1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6};
The array variable is 1 array with 2 rows and 3 columns.  Each element is a scalar.  The cell_array variable is essentially an array of arrays.  In this case the cell_array variable is made up of 6 arrays with 1 scalar element in each of the 6 arrays.

Cell arrays have fewer limitations than regular arrays.  The regular array, defined by the square brackets, can hold numbers or strings but if it holds strings in each element all the strings must be the same length.  Also, if 1 element of an array is  a string all elements must be a string.  Cell arrays have neither of these limitations.
  cell_array = {1, 2, 'a', 'abc'; rand(3, 2), magic(3), eye(3), 'junk'}
    cell_array = 
      [         1]    [         2]    'a'             'abc' 
      [3x2 double]    [3x3 double]    [3x3 double]    'junk' 

With the lack of limitations/rules for the content of a cell array comes complications.  These cell arrays are very powerful tools but take a lot of time to get used to because each element can be almost anything.

Cell arrays can also be dynamically resized--a key feature in more advanced data structures. For example, one can create a queue data structure using the commands:&lt;br&gt;
cell_array{end+1}='a';&lt;br&gt;
cell_array{end+1}='b';&lt;br&gt;
... etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Once can pop an element from the front of the queue using the commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
cell_array(1)=[]; % remove first element - resize&lt;br&gt;
cell_array(1)=[]; % remove first element - resize&lt;br&gt;
... etc.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Objectives==
===Cylindrical capacitor===
We might not have studied the structure of a cylindrical capacitor - that does not mean we can not solve this question!

Draw two concentric cylinders. For the electric field, we know we will use Gauss' law. The gaussian surface we choose is a cylinder of radius r (r = distance from the cente at which the field has to be found.)

Intg. E.dS = Qenc/Eo. We will not explain the simplifications on the LHS. However, simplifying it will tell you that the electric field is &lt;B&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;inversely proportional to r&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; and not r^2.

===Field lines through a conductor===
There are two things you need to know while solving this: -
* Electric field inside a conductor is zero. So field lines (direction of electric field) are not defined inside a conductor.
* Electric field near a conductor is perpendicular to its surface, because a conduting surface is equipotential.

This immediately gives us the answer to be &lt;B&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.

Now we put forward some descriptive questions whose answers form a part of a normal High School Physics course.

* Why is the electric field inside a conductor always zero? (Answer relates to charge separation till equilibrium is attained between two forces. This is just a hint, the reader has to supply a CBSE styled i.e. explanatory answer.)

* Why is the electric field near an equipotent surface perpendicular to it? (Use the relation between voltage, electric field vector and displacement vector)

* The conductor was placed in an uniform electric field. Why is then the electric field not uniform now? What has caused the disturbance in it? Field lines terminate at the left surface and restart from the right surface. What does this tell you about the charge distribution on the &lt;B&gt;Neutral&lt;/B&gt; Sphere?

===RMS Speed===
Purely formulae based. We dont need to provide a solution! The answer is B.

===Virtual Images===
Note first of all that the question must be speaking of only real objects. (u &lt; 0 in standard convention)

Anyone who has drawn ray diagrams properly knows for sure that the answer is Concave lens and a Convex Mirror.

Infact, this is factual for most students. Hence, you might want to prove this using calculations. Go ahead! Do not hesitate here! Remember that whenever something is excessively imple, just pick the pen up and solve it. if you do not do it - you might not be able to reproduce those results when required.

For convex mirror - use the mirror equation to get V (image) in terms of u. Substitute V=(-X) and F=(+F) so that every term on the RHS becomes positive and can be analyzed. The magnification will always be positive u &lt; 0 meaning that the image is virtual!

Similarly for a concave lens.

Answer is &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;B,C&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

===Holes===
Factual - p-type semiconductors

==On projectile motion==
===Introduction===
Collission in mid air? Right. Have you ever encountered questions which, upon reading once, make you believe they are pretty difficult, but whose solution makes you slap your forehead? This is one of those typical problems. When you get down to it, there is absolutely no analysis invovled! I emphasize through this example how simple questions can be made to look difficult by their presentation.

===Solution===
Shot A - The one which was launched at an angle.
Shot B - The one which was launched horizontally.

This is the first point which you need to think about. Which one of the two was launched first? Think about it, they have to collide. A has to cover the same horizontal displacement as B, but with a lesser horizontal velocity (why lesser horizontal velocity?). Its but obvious that A was launched first.

* If they collide, it just means that they are at the same position at the same instant of time. The two projectiles start from the same point, which means, in order to collide - their displacements must be same at a particular time instant.

For horizontal displacement, we have
[Hor. velocity of Particle 1] x [Time till collision] = [Hor. Vel. of particle 2] x [Time till collision]

* This is the best part about projectile motion! The horizontal motion of projectiles is uniform.

* All we have to do now is to substitute the values. Note that the time till collision for the two particles is not the same! If for the second particle it is T then for the first particle, it is T+t where t is the time interval between the firings.

Sx = xVA x (T+t) = xVB x (T)

This equation gives us T=t, after substituting the two velocities.
Sy = yVA x (T+t) - (0.5)(g)(T+t)^2 = yVB x (T) - (0.5)(g)(T)^2

Substituting T=t from the first equation and solving, we get &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;t=1 second interval between the firings.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

For the second part, we require horizontal and vertical displacements. Go back to the above equations, plug in t=1/T=1. We get Sx = 5(3)^0.5 and Sy = -5 m

The displacemtent is the final-initial coordinate, so &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;X = 5root3 m, Y = -5 + 10 = 5 m.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt; [Launched from (0,10), remember?]

==On adiabatic process==
===Introduction===
I just mentioned excessively simple problems in the projectile motion question above. Bless the heavens! This question on adiabatic expansion is a direct one! And direct means DIRECT! Pocket the 5 marks here - you'll have to work hard for them elsewhere.

===Final Temperature===
Use T1(V1)^(@-1) = T2(V2)^(@-1) where @ is the adiabatic exponent (gamma) of the gas, 5/3 in our case.

T2 = 300 K x (1/2)^(2/3) = &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;189 K&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

===Change in internal energy===
nCv(T2-T1) = -2767J. We will not tell you what n and cv are. Please forgive us.

===Work done by the gas===
We wont even tell you the answer over here! Use the first law to relate Q, Work done (IntegPdV) and DelE.
===Note===
Please note that P(V)^@ = Constant is valid only for a reversible adiabatic process. The question paper does not mention specifically that the process carried out is reversible adiabatic. If the process were irreversible with expansion carried out against constant external pressure = final pressure, use
* PV = NRT over initial and final stages
* P(V2-V1) [Integ.PdV] + nCv(T2-T1) = 0 [Q=0. If we are dealing with adiabatic process, how can we forget to use this equation?]

Also note that this is NOT a trick question! If the student had to consider irreversible processes as well, the JEE would have given MAJOR hints pointing towards that possibility. e.g., &quot;Answer all possible cases&quot; and such.

==Question 4 - Fraunhofer Diffraction Pattern==
DIRECT Question. Two marks not to be missed!

The angular width is 2Lamda/b where b is slit width (constant).

* If by changing the wavelength we decrease the width by 30%, it is evident from the equation that the wavelength was also reduced by 30%. Hence the answer to this part is 6000 x (70/100) = 4200 Angstorms.

That is, we used light of wavelength &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;4200 Angstorms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the second time.

Now, even if the apparatus is immersed in some liquid (A hypothetical question), the answer will be judged by the change in wavelength of the 6000 A light in that medium.

It is clear that the light of wavelength 6000 A in air behaves as light of 4200 A wavelength.

* 4200 = (6000)/(Mu) giving &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;Mu = 1.429&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
==Question 4 - The Prism==
===Introduction===
This is the first question that we expect prepared students to mess up at the JEE. However, bear in mind that I'm saying this just because the question involves more calculation than the others. Howver, it is as simple as the others.

===Critical incidence at the hypotenuse===
We are told to find that angle of incidence on AB for which the ray hits the cemented interface at the critical angle. Now, some students may find this a bit intriguing, but frankly speaking - I do not have anything to chase away that vagueness.

Recall the geometrical construction you made for a prism to find R1 + R2.

Here, R2 = Sin-1 (n1/n). If you realize that the normals at the two points and the two faces form a cyclic quadrilateral, it won't take you much time to realize that R1 = 45 - R2

Now relate R1 and the angle of incidence using Snell's law.

Finally we get Sin-1(sinI/n) = 45 - Sin-1 (n1/n).

i.e. (Sini) = n/root2[root(1-(n1/n)^2) - (n1/n)]

Tha angle i obtained from here is the answer. That is, &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;sin-1 [n/root2[root(1-(n1/n)^2) - (n1/n)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/red&gt;
===Angle of incidence for no deviation===
For the ray to pass undeviated at the hypotenuse, either the two refractive indices need to be same or the ray has to be incident normally on the hypotenuse.

In that case - R2 = 0. Giving R1 = 45. the angle of incidence can then be found using Snell's law.

Sini = (1.352)/(root 2), giving i = sin-1 0.956

==Wrapping up the first four questions==
Considering the calculations involved in the last Question 4, we do not expect everyone to do it in examination conditions without any silly mistake. Then, we can expect that majority of the prepared students would fetch 18-21 marks in this section, however scoring full 25 in the first four questions is not difficult as well. Its just that the proportion of such students would be less.

:::Don't worry about the VFD anymore. We usually leave them open for a few days to make sure we get plenty of input. An administrator will probably close the discussion after that.
:::On another note, we can't have people coming here from Wikipedia carrying on feuds that started there. We don't really tolerate fighting or bickering very well around here. Do me a favor and try to just ignore what other people say and try to resort to back-and-forth I'm-right-you're-wrong kinds of nonsense.

::::Okay, will do. I'm looking forward to input from other users here. So far I have tried out the split request and then reverted some of what I had tried. The main thing I am working on now is to add more in depth textural content about how the separatory equations work. They are explained extremely well by Dr. Rypka in the primary reference so paraphrasing is going to be very difficult and will probably take eons of time. I'll also be looking for and at other methods which might be capable of doing the same job so that there is reason to have more than one chapter. I plan to try lots of potential improvements in formatting, content, etc. but I think the key will be other user help. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:40, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

Dear Typetive,
I apologize for initial reception you had at Wikibooks.
I see you had initial bad experiences with people who are clearly unaware of our [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] and traditions.
Most of the editors at Wikibooks are much friendlier than that.
(There is an admin that post things that are short and curt almost to the point of being rude, but that's because that admin is very busy).

p.s.: I thought you might be amused by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Graham%27s_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.jpg Graham's Hierarchy of disagreement] (I found this via [[wikipedia:WP:DR#Discuss]]).
I hope it helps you feel smugly superior to those who attack you.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:51, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

:Hi David,
:No, as a matter of fact, my interaction here with everyone here has been very beneficial, supportive and rewarding. I have absolutely no complaints regarding anyone here and do not expect to have any in the future. The two users who were behind the nomination for deletion created an account here for no other reason. The people here at Wikibooks are much more mature than anyone I would now expect to find at the Wikipedia. I recall the age I was when I first discovered the encyclopedia. Instead of embracing the concept of collaboration over content contribution the idea over there has become to get rid of anything that is not already perfectly polished. There may be other motives over there that are not quite so understandable or acceptable so if working here can avoid those issues then here is by far the better place to work. I'll check out link above shortly and comment later about it. Knowing the motive of the two users from the Wikipedia, along with those who supported them, tells me the average age over there now must be under twelve, so on that basis I feel completely neutral. I'm guessing but I would say the ratio of knowledgeable content providers to spoiled children demanding a better product instead of editing themselves is one out of every nine million. I'm sure glad I am not under twelve anymore. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 01:46, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Show preview ==

Hi Typetive,

I've noticed in the edit histories that you make very rapid saves. These quickly clutter up the histories of pages making it difficult to find particular versions and changes. Please consider using the &quot;Show preview&quot; button. It sits on the right of the &quot;Save page&quot; button. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:42, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
::Thank you for making me aware that the number of edits in the edit history is an issue for you. I am use to this issue being resolved elsewhere, not by the editor, but by edit logic to accommodate the way the human brain operates rather than the other way around. In other words the &quot;Save page&quot; button ''and'' a &quot;Show preview&quot; button are not placed side by side in parallel but are rather placed in series by the edit software such that '''all''' edits require preview prior to committing to save. I can not go beyond that comment for now except to say that as the result of participating in high speed interactive forums I have developed a normal style of editing similar to the way JPG - interlacing is done, where each progressive edit interval varies in time so that ''something'' can be seen immediately with clarity to follow. Using this mode of editing requires I proceed according to my immediate perception of clarity to be derived from the next progressive until I have more time to finish the job and from the degree of ''thought compression'' that I am using. In addition, when in experimental mode, some &quot;Save page&quot; edits are necessary to make ''other changes'' without the edit being lost. I will try to remain in edit mode for longer periods of time, however, to accumulate minor edits prior to saving the page I'm working on to accommodate your wishes. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 06:29, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

== Your User Page ==

Hello Typetive, how are you? I've gotten a few complaints about your user page. It really does look like a personal attack, and that isn't really acceptable here. I would really appreciate it if you could take that stuff down. We really don't need to have fighting here over this book anymore. It's not going to be deleted now, there is nothing for you to worry about, so we don't need to have people fighting over it anymore. I'm trying to be nice, of course, but this is really more of a requirement then a request. Thanks. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:54, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

:Okay, sorry, I forgot about it. Being trained to avoid libel in legal forums I often forget that in other places true and factual statements can still be deemed personal attack. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 14:38, 2 August 2008 (UTC)
::P.S. Thanks for being nice. It is so rare over there when it comes to enforcing a requirement it will take me a while to get used to. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 19:51, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

:::I do try to be nice and patient, I was a new user once myself! Thank you for being so responsive to the request. Little actions like this can make big problems disappear. Compared to Wikipedia, this place can feel like paradise sometimes. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:59, 2 August 2008 (UTC)
::::That is good news to hear. I've never been able to figure out the contrariness over there. (Except perhaps on reflection that all but one administrator and bureaucrat is older than 15.)  It seems that no matter where you make a comment or a suggestion whatever it is gets put down. The irony of course is that some articles like [[w:Biochar|biochar]] are very thoughtfully written, which is what I strive to do and which makes the Wikipedia attractive to me for that reason. Also if I stay away from the reference desks and the pump and limit what I do to reading and correcting typo's I can usually survive over there without a confrontation for at least a couple of days. ;-) [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 20:14, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

== FYI, a note on subpage syntax ==

FYI, you could have used &lt;code&gt;{{[[User:Typetive/Template:Check sort C++ code|../Template:Check sort C++ code]]}}&lt;/code&gt; on [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}/sandbox]] if you wanted to generalize or futureproof it.  (it won't break if you're renamed) Cheers, [[User:Jeremyb|Jeremyb]] ([[User talk:Jeremyb|talk]]) 20:13, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

:Okay, tried it. What's with renaming here? [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 20:18, 7 August 2008 (UTC)
:Also, what's with the weird alignment problem associated with the template? [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 20:27, 7 August 2008 (UTC)
::Users can be renamed and then their userspace moves with them.  On second thought it would probably not break because redirects are created too, but this way it's always pointing to the right place directly.  What's the alignment issue?  I don't see any difference here.  [[User:Jeremyb|Jeremyb]] ([[User talk:Jeremyb|talk]]) 05:53, 8 August 2008 (UTC)
:::I don't know. The template looked fine in preview but after save their was no side bar and the page was off screen. Panic fixed it I think by adding spaces or something. Saw same thing on forum site. Other users said characters in the example code or template were interpreted as page formatting codes. Weird. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 13:42, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

== Classification Book ==

I would like to help you out with your classification book, and I've got lots of resources to do it. I've written a little [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|book]] about how to create books, if you want to take a look through that for some information. It's not &quot;official&quot;, just a compilation of my experiences over the years. I've also written an javascript outlining tool that can help with most of the grunt work. To install the javascript, click on [[Special:Preferences|my preferences]], click the '''Gadgets''' tab, and select the checkbox &quot;Whiteknight's Book Creator&quot;. Once you save and exit, you can go to [[User:Whiteknight/Visual Book Designer]] to try it out. I would love all the feedback I can get, if you do decide to use this tool.

I personally would start with an outline for your book. You can create it either in at [[Talk:Optimal Classification]] if you think people will see it there, or you can create a page in your userspace such as [[User:Typetive/Classification]]. I [[User:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|do this same thing pretty often]]. Editing and rearranging an outline is much quicker and easier then rearranging an entire book! Once you have your outline, you can turn it into a Table of Contents pretty easily, by converting the points in the outline into links to pages.

Once you get your book ready, I can help get you set up with all the details such as inter-page navigation templates, page categories, a cover page, a printable version, etc. 

Look around at some of the resources, and let me know if you need some help or if you have any questions. Good luck with your project! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:52, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

:At this point the only outline I have in mind is to create the &quot;Classification&quot; book, move the &quot;Optimal Classification&quot; chapter to it and then to start filling in the blanks around it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Function ===

✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DATA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;item1&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;item2&lt;/i&gt; ...]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

This statement is used to list data constants (numbers or strings, quoted or unquoted) to be accessed by the &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; statement. Each item must be a numeric or string constant; string constants may be quoted or unquoted. The items are separated by commas. Leading spaces (between a comma and the item that follows it, or between the &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; keyword and the first item) are ignored; therefore, if you wish to represent a string item which contains commas and/or leading spaces, you must enclose it in quotes. Trailing spaces in an unquoted string item are not ignored; they're considered part of the string.

To represent a numeric item in a &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statement, you can use a decimal, hex, octal or binary constant.

You can have as many &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statements in your program as you like, and as many or as few items in each &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statement as you like. The only restriction is that the total number of data items (in all &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statements) must be at least enough to satisfy all &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; requests. You can use the &lt;code&gt;RESTORE&lt;/code&gt; statement to allow &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; items to be read more than once.

&lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statements are global in scope: this means that any &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; statement (whether it's in a local function, or in &quot;main&quot;) can access any &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statement (whether it's in a (possibly different) local function, or in &quot;main&quot;). &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statements are &quot;non-executable,&quot; which means you can't change their effect by putting them inside a conditional execution structure such as &lt;code&gt;LONG IF&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt;. However, you can conditionally include or exclude them from the program by putting them inside a &lt;code&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/code&gt; block.

Note that everything between the &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; keyword and the end of the line is considered part of the &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statement. In particular, this means that you cannot use the &quot;&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; separator to put another statement after the &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statement on the same line, and you cannot put a comment after the &lt;code&gt;'''DATA'''&lt;/code&gt; statement on the same line.

{{merge from | Help:Print versions }}

In a [[Using Wikibooks/Printing A Wikibook | previous chapter we discussed how to print a Wikibook]], assuming a &quot;print version&quot; or &quot;PDF&quot; or &quot;collection&quot; has already been set up.

But what do you do when you want to print out a complete Wikibook, but none of them have been set up yet? [[Wikibooks:Be bold|Be bold]] and do the setup yourself. Here's how.

== Print Versions ==

Print versions are pages which contain all the pages of the book, as well as any other information that should be added to the print version. Print versions are created by creating a new page for the print version, say book name/print version, and then transcluding every page in the book, in the order in which you want them to appear. So if a book called ''book'' had the pages ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', and you wanted to have the print version contain the pages in that order, then on your table of contents page you would add

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Print version|book/print version}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

near the top to make it display the print version box on the page. Then you would click on the link to the page and put in

&lt;pre&gt;
{{:book/A}}
{{:book/B}}
{{:book/C}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

and it should include the pages when you click show preview or save.

== PDF versions ==

There are a few ways that you can create PDF versions.

#save the print version as a HTML file and open it up in an editor which can export to PDF, then format it and export it.
#create the PDF from scratch, copying and pasting text in, and copying the formatting of the web page in your editor
#using a script to generate a PDF document from the HTML
#Using the [[Help:Collections|Collections Extension]] (See below)
#[http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf MediaWiki to LaTeX] 

there are more ways to do it but I didn't put them in. When you create the PDF file you upload it using [[Special:Upload]] and then put in the filename to upload it to, with a short description. Once you have uploaded it you go back to your TOC and add

&lt;pre&gt;
{{PDF version|filename of PDF}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

which creates the PDF version box on the page

== Collections Extension ==

Wikibooks now has a special extension for grouping individual pages together into a group called a '''collection'''. Once a collection has been created, there are three options available:

#Download a PDF version of the collection
#Download an ODT (OpenOffice.Org Text Document) file
#Publish a copy by PediaPress, and have it mailed to you.

If we replace the word &quot;Collection&quot; with the word &quot;Book&quot; in the sentences above, we can see a very clear way that this extension can be used here at Wikibooks. In addition to creating an ordinary Table of Contents and a print version, a collection can also be created that will enable PDF versions and published versions to be created quickly for your book.

There are two types of collections: '''Community collections''' and '''personal collections'''. Community Settings are created as subpages of [[Wikibooks:Collections]]. Each book should have only one (or a very limited number) of &quot;official&quot; community versions. The community versions can be advertised using the {{tl|collection}} template on the book itself. Sometimes, individual users prefer a slightly different reading order to the material, or like to add additional chapters from a related book, or remove a few chapters, or any number of small modifications. In this case, the user can create their own collection in their user namespace, as a subpage of [[Special:MyPage/Collections]]. Private collections can be edited and shared with other users just like a normal wiki page.

=== Creating a Collection ===

Creating a collection is easy. There are two ways to do it:

# When you find a page you want to add, click &quot;Add wiki page&quot; on the left. This will add the current page to the current collection. Continue for all pages you like. When you are happy with your collection, you can go to [[Special:Collection]] to edit, save, download, or print your collection.
# You can create a collection on a regular page using regular wiki text. Here's an example:
  &lt;nowiki&gt;
  == Title ==
  === Subtitle ===
  :[[Page1]]
  :[[Page2]]
  ;Chapter 1
  :[[Page3]]
  :[[Page4]]
  ;Chapter 2
  :[[Page5]]
  :[[Page6]]

  [[Category:Collections]]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Collections]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' at the bottom is important because it indicates to the software that the page represents an extension. To see a list of all pages in this category (and therefore all extensions) go to [[:Category:Collections]].

Here are some things that can be in a collection, and the syntax that's used to save them:

;Title and Subtitle:A collection can have both a title and a subtitle. In wikitext, the title can be specified as a level-2 heading, and the subtitle can be specified as a level-3 heading. A collection may only have one of each.
;Chapters and Pages:In terms of collections, a &quot;chapter&quot; is a large heading that precedes a group of related pages, and a &quot;Page&quot; is an individual page on the wiki. Chapter names can be specified with a semicolon. Pages in a chapter can be specified as a regular absolute wikilink, with a colon in front like &lt;nowiki&gt;:[[My Book/Page 1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, not a relative link like &lt;nowiki&gt;:[[/Page 1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
;Display Title: If you just use a normal link, the page will be titled &quot;My Book/My Page&quot; in the generated PDF and print-on-demand book. If you use a piped link, the display name of the chapter can be changed. So &lt;nowiki&gt;:[[My Book/My Page|My First Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will display &quot;My First Page&quot; as the display name in the generated book or PDF file.

=== Using Collections ===

Once a collection is generated, either by loading pages into your collection one at a time or by loading an existing saved collection, it can be used in a number of ways:

;Downloading: A collection can be downloaded in PDF or ODT format
;Print on Demand: A collection can be sent to our print-on-demand partner PediaPress and a copy of the book can be mailed to you.</text>

== DATE$ == 
 
=== Function === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dateString$&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;DATE$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DATE$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function reads the system clock and returns the current date as a string in the format: &lt;code&gt;MM/DD/YY&lt;/code&gt; (that is, the string returned contains two digit numerals each for month, day and year, separated by slash marks).

You can use the Toolbox routine &lt;code&gt;IUDATESTRING&lt;/code&gt; to get a date string that is formatted according to the international specifications set in the &quot;Date &amp; Time&quot; control panel. See the sample program &lt;code&gt;IUDATESTRING.BAS&lt;/code&gt; to see how this is done.

==== Example ====

res/cd.gif image &lt;code&gt; CD Example: IUDATESTRING.BAS&lt;/code&gt;

==== Note ====

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DATE$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function only returns the last two digits of the year. To get the complete 4-digit year value, you can use the &lt;code&gt;SECONDSTODATE&lt;/code&gt; Toolbox function (previously &lt;code&gt;SECS2DATE&lt;/code&gt; - both are supported in FutureBasic), as follows:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; dateRec &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; DateTimeRec&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; secs&amp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; theMonth%,theDay%,theYear%,theWeekday%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CALL GETDATETIME&lt;/b&gt;( secs&amp; )&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CALL SECONDSTODATE&lt;/b&gt;(secs&amp;,dateRec)&lt;br&gt;
theMonth%&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= dateRec.month&lt;br&gt;
theDay%&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= dateRec.day&lt;br&gt;
theYear%&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= dateRec.year&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Full 4 digits&lt;br&gt;
theWeekday% = dateRec.dayOfWeek '1=Sunday, 7=Saturday&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; theMonth%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; theDay%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; theYear%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; theWeekday%&lt;/code&gt;

=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEC&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;numericVariable&lt;/i&gt; -= &lt;i&gt;valueToSubtract&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
May 30, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===

This statement decrements &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; by 1 (or by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;valueToSubtract&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;); that is, it subtracts 1 from the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and stores the value back into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a (signed or unsigned) byte variable, short-integer variable or long-integer variable. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is already at the minimum value for its variable type, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEC&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; will cycle it back to its maximum value. As of Release 3, FB supports the use of -= to decrease the value of a variable by a specified amount.

==== Example ====
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEC&lt;/b&gt;(x&amp;)&lt;/code&gt;

and...

&lt;code&gt;x&amp; -= 1&lt;/code&gt;

and...

&lt;code&gt;x&amp; --&lt;/code&gt;

...are all equivalent to:

&lt;code&gt;x&amp; = x&amp; - 1&lt;/code&gt;

The following expressions are also equivalent:

&lt;code&gt;x&amp;amp; = x&amp;amp; - 100&lt;br&gt;
x&amp;amp; -= 100&lt;/code&gt;

==== Note ====

The &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt; syntax may not be used for arrays of strings, containers, or records where arrays are involved, only numeric values may take advantage of this syntax.

&lt;code&gt;INC; DEC LONG/WORD/BYTE; DEF CYCLE&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

This statement decrements the long integer, short integer or byte which begins at the specified address in memory; that is, it subtracts 1 from the value in memory and stores the result back into the addressed location. If the long integer, short integer or byte is already at its minimum possible value, then the statement will cycle it back to its maximum value.

==== Example ====

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEC LONG&lt;/b&gt; (myAddr&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt;

...is equivalent to:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POKE LONG&lt;/b&gt; myAddr&amp;amp;, &lt;b&gt;PEEK LONG&lt;/b&gt;(myAddr&amp;amp;) - 1&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

This statement adds the specified &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the relocatable block specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;STR#resourceHndl&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;STR#resourceHndl&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be a handle to an existing &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource, or a handle to a block which you intend to save as an &lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt; resource. To create a new, empty handle for use with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you should create it like this:

&lt;code&gt;myHandle&amp;amp; = &lt;b&gt;FN NEWHANDLE&lt;/b&gt; _clear (2)&lt;/code&gt;

After you have added strings to the new handle, you can save it as a resource by calling the &lt;code&gt;ADDRESOURCE&lt;/code&gt; routine (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/MoreToolbox/MoreToolbox-64.html).

To get a handle to an existing &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource for use with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you can use any of a variety of Resource Manager functions such as &lt;code&gt;GETRESOURCE&lt;/code&gt;: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/MoreToolbox/MoreToolbox-50.html.

==== Note ====

Never use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on a purgeable resource, unless you first call &lt;code&gt;FN&amp;nbsp;HNOPURGE (str#handle&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt; (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Memory/Memory-91.html) to (temporarily) make it unpurgeable. If you think the resource may have been purged before you had a chance to call &lt;code&gt;FN HNOPURGE&lt;/code&gt;, then you should also &lt;code&gt;CALL LOADRESOURCE (str#handle&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt; (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/MoreToolbox/MoreToolbox-56.html) to make sure it's loaded into memory.

If you are using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to update an existing &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource, then use &lt;code&gt;CALL CHANGEDRESOURCE (str#handle&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt; (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/MoreToolbox/MoreToolbox-63.html) after using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to cause your changes to be written to disk when the resource file is closed or updated.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; could cause a system error if heap memory is very low or very fragmented. You can use the &lt;code&gt;MEM(_maxAvail)&lt;/code&gt; function periodically to de-fragment memory.

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;June, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
This statement designates and enables the routine that FB will call when certain kinds of errors occur. There may only be one &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; vector. If you use a second call to &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the new routine replaces the old version in subsequent calls. However you can deactivate or reactivate error trapping as often as you need. Using the &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR END&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ON ERROR RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statements you can switch between the default behavior and your error handler.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; handleFileError&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ÊÊPRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Sorry. Something has gone wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ÊÊSTOP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR FN&lt;/b&gt; handleFileError&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OPEN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;this file does not exist&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR&lt;/b&gt; FN userFunction&lt;/code&gt; syntax, then &lt;code&gt;userFunction&lt;/code&gt; must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your error handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result.

ON ERROR END
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;June, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
There are two possible outcomes when using this statement and they depend on other factors in your program. If you have not established any other error handling routine, then you may use this routine to turn off all error checking. Errors such as file errors will be ignored. It will be your responsibility to track them manually after each file access statement by checking the function &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt;. This concept is demonstrated in the example below.

A second use involves programs where you have set up your own error handling routines. You may toggle between FB's error handling and your program's built-in error handlers by using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to turn off FB's handlers and use the ones in your program. Alternatively, you may use &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR RETURN&lt;/code&gt; to reinstate FB's handlers.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Manual, line-by-line error handling&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;This program will produce a file error&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;that is completely ignored.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OPEN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;this file does not exist&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;The error has occurred and was not flagged.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;The error number is&amp;quot;; &lt;b&gt;ERROR AND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp;FF&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;In file number&amp;quot;; &lt;b&gt;ERROR&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;The system error is&amp;quot;; &lt;b&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you turn off error checking (&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON ERROR END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and you get an error with &lt;code&gt;x = ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, then your program must clear the error variable with &lt;code&gt;ERROR = _noErr&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

Draws a double border (in the current color and pattern) around the outside of the rectangle which is specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which should be an 8-byte variable such as a &lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt; type), or pointed to by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rectAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;twoPixelBorder&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; (nonzero), then the outer border is drawn with a 2-pixel pen width; otherwise it's drawn with a 1-pixel pen width.

==== Example ====

image res/cd.gif &lt;code&gt;CD Example: DEF BORDER.BAS&lt;/code&gt;

==== FB Lite Behavior ====

When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF BORDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Graphics Window before executing.

=== Description ===

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;buttonID%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the ID number of a button or scroll bar in the current window, then this statement returns the button's (or scroll bar's) bounding rectangle into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which should be an 8-byte variable such as a &lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt; type), or into the 8 bytes starting at address &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rectAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A button's ID number is assigned by the &lt;code&gt;BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; statement; a scroll bar's ID number is assigned by the &lt;code&gt;SCROLL BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; statement.

==== Example ====

image res/cd.gif &lt;code&gt;CD Example: DEF BTNRECT.BAS&lt;/code&gt;

==== Note ====

If the specified button does not exist, then the rectangle (0,0)-(0,0) is returned.

==== Revised ====

May, 2003 (Release 8)

=== Description ===

In non Carbon applications, help balloons are used to display the help message associated with a given button. Unlike Help tags in Carbon, Help balloons related to FutureBASIC buttons will not show up magically on screen. Your application must determine when the Help balloon must be displayed. You will generally intercept a &lt;code&gt;_cursOver&lt;/code&gt; event in you dialog handler to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;btnID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; over which the mouse pointer is located. Help balloons must be enabled at the system level in order to see effectively the Help balloons on screen.

This command is ignored in Carbon applications.

You must include &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;Subs Help tags.Incl&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; in your project to make this command available to your program.

=== Syntax ===

=== Description ===
Use this statement to reinstate FB's standard error checking routines. After this statement is invoked, FB will display an error dialog and halt the program when a file error is encountered. If your program has established its own &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR FN&lt;/code&gt; vector, it will be ignored. If you wish to return control to your internal routine or turn off FB's error checking, use &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR END&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF BUTTONHELPSETTEXT&lt;/b&gt; ( &lt;i&gt;btnID%&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;i&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt; , &lt;i&gt;helpMessage$&lt;/i&gt; )&lt;/code&gt;

==== Revised ====

May, 2003 (Release 8)

=== Description ===

This routine associates the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;helpMessage$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; string with the button specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;bntID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Behavior for Carbon applications ====

Help tags are meant to replace help balloons in Carbon. They should provide concise and precise information about the action of the button located under the mouse pointer. Help tags are displayed automatically by the system when no event of a higher priority is pending and they disappear from the screen as soon as an input from the user must be handled.

Because Help tags are much more subtle than the outdated Help balloons their visibility status defaults to on. You can toggle the display of the Help tags with &lt;code&gt;DEF&amp;nbsp;BUTTONHELPSHOW(visibilityFlag)&lt;/code&gt;.

The&lt;code&gt; &lt;i&gt;helpMessage$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;string parameter may contain escape codes to setup the alignment of the help tag displayed on screen and the extra message that usually appears when the Command key is held down. The string might be formatted like so: &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;helpmessage[\&amp;sect;[+]additionalMessage][@alignmentCode]&amp;quot; &lt;/code&gt;where: &lt;code&gt;\&amp;sect; &lt;/code&gt;indicates the ending of the first help message and the beginning of the second. Optionally, you can add the second message to the first using the + symbol. &lt;code&gt;\@ alignmentCode&lt;/code&gt; indicates the position of the help tag relative to the button specified. You can use one of the following alignement codes (T, L, B, R and C) standing for top, left, bottom, right and center respectively:

&lt;code&gt;T; L; B; R; LC(CL); RC(CR); TL; TR; LT; LB; BL; BR; RT; RB.&lt;/code&gt;

For example, the string below would display a help tag at the top of the button. Holding down the Command key would append A carriage return + more info.

&lt;code&gt;message = &amp;quot;Close the demo\&amp;sect;+and I could have a rest\@T&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

==== Behavior for PPC (starting with Mac OS 8.5) ====

PPC applications use the Help balloons mechanism to display the message associated with a given button. However, an extra step is required to make the balloon show up effectively on screen. When your dialog handler intercepts a cursor event, you must call &lt;code&gt;DEF BUTTONHELPDISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; if the mouse is over a button located in the active window. If Help balloons are enabled at the system level then the help message is displayed. Note that the second help message is ignored in PPC.

You must include &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;Subs Help tags.Incl&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; in your project to make this command available to your program.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF BUTTONHELPSETTEXT&lt;/b&gt; (_quitBtn, &amp;quot;Shutdown the application&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON EVENT&lt;/b&gt; {&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction|&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;{&lt;i&gt;lineNumber&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;stmtLabel&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a system-event handling routine. A system-event handling routine is called in response to any event which the MacOS puts into the event queue designated for your program. This includes various kinds of low-level events such as mouseclicks and keypresses, as well as high-level events such as Apple Events. See the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;event.html&quot;&gt;EVENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function for more information.

After a system event occurs, FB does not call your designated routine immediately. Instead, your program continues executing until a &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement is reached. At that time, &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; will call your designated routine once for each system event that occurred; your designated routine should examine the &lt;code&gt;EVENT&lt;/code&gt; function to get information about the event.

If there are no events in the system queue when your program executes &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;, FB calls your designated routine once, passing it a &amp;quot;null&amp;quot; event in the &lt;code&gt;EVENT&lt;/code&gt; record.

Even if you don't designate a system-event handling routine, FB often uses system events to determine whether other kinds of interesting events have occurred. For example, if the queue contains a system event of type &lt;code&gt;_mButDwnEvt&lt;/code&gt; (indicating that the user has pressed the mouse button), FB checks whether the mouse was clicked inside a button, or in the menu bar, or in the &amp;quot;close box&amp;quot; of a window, etc., and may generate an event such as a dialog event or a menu event that your program can detect in other event handling routines.

By designating a system-event handling routine, your program can &amp;quot;intercept&amp;quot; events like &lt;code&gt;_mButDwnEvt&lt;/code&gt;, before FB has a chance to interpret them and report them to your other event handling routines. (When a system event occurs, FB always calls your system-event handling routine first, before any of your other designated event handling routines.) This allows your program to customize the way it responds to system events, in case FutureBasic's &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; responses don't meet your needs. If you handle an event within your system-event handling routine, you can inhibit FB from further interpreting the event by setting the &lt;code&gt;_evtNum&lt;/code&gt; field in the event record to &lt;code&gt;_nullEvt &lt;/code&gt;before returning from your routine, as illustrated here:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; DoEvent&lt;br&gt;
evtPtr&amp;amp; = &lt;b&gt;EVENT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SELECT CASE&lt;/b&gt; evtPtr&amp;amp;.evtNum%&lt;br&gt;
'[handle the event as desired in here]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'&amp;quot;Hide&amp;quot; the event from further handling by FB:&lt;br&gt;
evtPtr&amp;amp;.evtNum% = _nullEvt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another good reason to designate a system-event handling routine is so that your program can respond to high-level events such as Apple Events. See the [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-28.html#HEADING28-0&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Event Manager&amp;quot]; chapter in [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot;] Inside Macintosh [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html] Macintosh Toolbox Essentials, for a discussion of high-level events.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON EVENT FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction&lt;/code&gt; syntax, then &lt;code&gt;userFunction&lt;/code&gt; must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your system-event handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF BUTTONHELPSHOW&lt;/b&gt; ( &lt;i&gt;showHideFlag&lt;/i&gt; )&lt;/code&gt;

==== Revised ====

October, 2002 (Release 8)

=== Description ===

Because Help tags are indeed less intrusive than Help balloons that they replace in Carbon, Apple has decided that their default behavior is popping up on screen as time permits. On the other hand, Help balloons are turned off by default. However, you or your end-user may wish to act upon that behavior.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF BUTTONHELPSHOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; lets you control the display of Help tags in Carbon or Help balloons in PPC. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;showHideFlag&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is zero the Help messages are no longer displayed, any other value for this parameter will cause the reappearance of the Help tags on screen, as soon as the system determines it is time to do so.

An additional step is required for non Carbon applications in order to display the help balloons associated with buttons created in FutureBASIC: you must call &lt;code&gt;DEF&amp;nbsp;BUTTONHELPDISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; at an appropriate time, i.e. when the mouse enters the button area.

You must include &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;Subs Help tags.Incl&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; in your project to make this command available to your program.

=== Description ===

Draws the text in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (using the current font, size, style, etc.) within the rectangle specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which should be an 8-byte variable such as a &lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt; type) or pointed to by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rectAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

No frame is drawn around the rectangle. If the rectangle is not wide enough to contain the entire string, then the string is automatically wrapped around to the next line, at word boundaries.

Each line of text is either Centered, Left-justified or Right-justified within the rectangle, depending on which variant of the statement you use.

No text is ever drawn outside of the rectangle; if the rectangle is not big enough to contain the entire string, then the text is clipped.

When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF &amp;lt;just&amp;gt;BOX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements switch to the Graphics Window before executing.

==== Note ====

To draw rectangle-bounded text that will redraw itself automatically (during a window refresh), use a static edit field (see the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement).

=== What is op-amp? ===

[[Image:Op-amp_notion_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;How to drive and supply an op-amp.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Inputs.''' Grounded voltage source... What is ''single-ended input''? Floating voltage source... What is ''differential input''? Why do we need a differential input? Input resistance... Do input currents flow? How does a non-inverting input behave? How does an inverting input behave? Can we use an op-amp with a differential input as an op-amp with single-ended (inverting or non-inverting) input? What do we do in these cases?

'''Output.''' How the op-amp output is made? What is the idea of a complementary, push-pull emitter follower? Output resistance...

'''Supplying.''' The idea of bipolar (split) supply (+12 V and -12 V here)... Why do we need a bipolar supply? Where currents flow? We can imagine the output part of the op-amp consists of two parts - a positive and a negative. Each of them works when its output voltage has the according polarity. By the way, is it possible to supply the op-amp with only one (e.g., positive) voltage and, at the same time, to obtain the opposite (negative) output voltage? And can the op-amp output voltage exceed the supply voltage? Maybe, it would be possible, if there were capacitive or inductive differentiating circuits inside the op-amp... But (for now) an op-amp contains only resistive and active components:(

'''Gain.''' Typical value is A &gt; 200000. It seems too high. Can we manage to utilize all this gain? What is the maximum input voltage to keep the op-amp in the active region (assume 10 V maximum output voltage)? Can we use a bare op-amp as an amplifier? Or we can use it as another useful device having analog inputs and descrete output (write its name here)? We may conclude: If we use the op-amp as an amplifier, the voltage difference between its inputs is zero. But if we use it as a ''comparator'', the input voltage might be whatever.


[[Image:Non-inverting_comparator_screen_65a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A transfer characteristic on the screen.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Op-amp_transfer_char_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The op-amp transfer characteristic is extremely precipitous.&lt;/center&gt;]]


'''Transfer characteristic.''' Microlab can help us to obtain this curve on the screen. There is no time in this graphical presentation; there is only input and output quantities. We might discern three regions on this curve: negative saturation (large), active region (narrow) and positive saturation (large).

'''Generalization.''' What does the op-amp actually do? A possible answer is: ''an op-amp converts the steady power supply into varying voltage source; it acts as a voltage-controlled voltage source.''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building a general negative feedback follower ===

==== Analogies ====

[[Image:Negative_feedback_follower_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A negative feedback follower consists of only three components.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Driving:''' keeping up a constant speed, direction, temperature, volume...
More negative feedback analogies: studying, teaching, keeping up a room temperature (body weight, mental equilibrium...) In all these cases we do all that is possible to realize our goals, to move toward the goal...

==== Structure (block diagram) ====

So, the simplest negative feedback follower consists of only three components: power (energy) source E, regulating element R and a subtractor (-).


==== Operation ====

This humble device operates according to a simple algorithm: if X &gt; Y, then increase Y; if X &lt; Y, decrease Y; if X = Y, do nothing. As a result, always X = Y. So, this is an &quot;active copying&quot; principle and this device is an &quot;active follower&quot;. This &quot;algorithm&quot; is so simple that humble devices (tubes, transistors, op-amps...) having no any intelect can perform it.

==== Advantages ====

Why do we make followers in this odd way? What are the advantages of this &quot;negative feedback&quot; approach?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building an op-amp follower ===

==== Passive electric follower ====

[[Image:Passive_electric_follower_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A humble wire is the simplest but imperfect voltage &quot;follower&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now, we have only to convey this powerful idea from real life to electronics. Well, let's begin.

V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; will represent X in our electric follower; accordingly, V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; will represent Y. But let's first persuade ourselves what is the use of building such an active follower instead a &quot;passive&quot; one.

What is the simplest voltage follower? Of course, a piece of wire can act as a humle voltage follower. It works perfectly, if there is no load (there is no current flowing). Only, is it still a follower, if we connect a big load at the end of the wire (especially, if it is a thin and long wire)? And imagine what happens, if the load and wire resistances vary... For example, the wire length can vary...

Another nasty problem of the passive voltage follower is that ''the load consumes energy from the input voltage source''.; so, it droops when loaded.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Op-amp negative feedback follower ====

[[Image:Op-amp_follower_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

No, the bare wire is not a perfect follower in all the cases; so, it is worth the trouble to build an active negative feedback follower...

First, we connect a power supply - a voltage source V representing the power source E from the block diagram. We assume a bipolar input voltage; so, we get a bipolar (split) power supply. Then, we connect an op-amp OA acting as the regulating element R. Finally, we need a voltage subtractor to make the op-amp compare its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. What is the simplest voltage [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer|subtractor]]? Of course, this is the bare loop (a piece of wire) according to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). In other words, we have to connect the two voltage sources in series and in opposite directions (+ -, - +) traversing the loop, in order to subtract their voltages. Then, we have to cut the loop and to feed the op-amp input by the voltage difference.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Operation ====

[[Image:Students3_66a_lab4_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Where do currents flow? Thinking about current loops.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We are human beings, not computers... It seems strange but, in order to understand what the abstract op-amp really does in this circuit, we have to think of the op-amp as a &quot;slow-thinking&quot; device, not as a fast, non-inertial, instant device... From this human viewpoint, the op-amp compares continuously its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and changes V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; in the right direction so that to keep almost zero difference V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. It does exactly the same what we, human beings, were doing in all the analogies above.

Where do currents flow in this circuit? Draw them with whole loops in the two cases - at a positive and a negative input voltage. Remember: ''a current always arrives at the point from where it has gone''. Another tip: ''in the two cases (at positive and negative input voltage) the load current will flow through different power supplies (accordingly, through the positive and negative voltage sources)''. Imagine also the complementary output emitter follower inside the op-amp: the upper n-p-n transistor will &quot;blows&quot; the output current when the op-amp &quot;wants&quot; to produce a positive voltage and the lower p-n-p transistor will &quot;sucks&quot; the output current when the op-amp &quot;wants&quot; to produce a negative voltage.

==== Revised ====

August, 2002 (Release 7)

=== Description ===

There are probably more potential problems in dealing with the Resource Manager than any other part of the Mac toolbox. One bug in the manager's code is that every time a resource is marked as changed, space is reserved on the disk for a new version without removing any previous requests. So if you change a resource 100 times, then space will be reserved on your hard drive for 100 copies. This becomes a problem because the file size and the number of resources allowed in a single file is finite.

This procedure will only mark a handle as changed (a) it is a resource handle and (b) it is not already flagged as a changed resource.

=== Description ===

Places a checkmark next to the specified item in the specified menu, and unchecks all other items in that menu. The menu ID number is assigned by the &lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt; statement, or by a Toolbox routine that creates the menu, or by the resource that defines the menu. The item ID corresponds to the item's position in the menu (the item just under the menu title is item #1). Note that gray &amp;quot;dividing lines&amp;quot; in menus are also counted as menu items.

Use an &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value of zero to uncheck all items in the menu.

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;February, 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
You establish this vector before entering your event loop. When a file is dropped onto your application's icon or one of your applications files is double-clicked from the Finder, the specified routine is called with information on how to open the file.

The routines are set up to handle up to 1024 files at a time. If this number is insufficient, you will need to change the DIM statement in the header file named &amp;quot;Subs Files.Incl&amp;quot;. There are three global values maintained for this vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gFBFndrInfoCount&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of files pending in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gFBInfoSpec(1024) as FSSpec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An array of file spec records. There is one file spec record for each file that needs to be opened or printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gFBInfoAction%(1024)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boolean value that is zero if the file is to be opened and non-zero if it is to be printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;This routine establishes a function that is called when a file is dropped onto the compiled version of the application. It also shows how to determine if a file is to be printed or opened.

&lt;code&gt;/*&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Build the application,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;then drop a text file on to it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; MyOpenFile ( fs as ^FSSpec )&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;FileName: &amp;quot;;fs.name&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; MyFinderInfo&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM AS&lt;/b&gt; FSSpec fs&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM AS SHORT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;21&quot;&gt;@ count, action, j&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM AS OSTYPE&lt;/b&gt; @ fType&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;count = 0 // set to ask &amp;quot;How many?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;action = &lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;( count, fs, fType ) // FSSpec &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
OSType&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; ( count &amp;gt; 0 ) // at least one file wants in&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FOR&lt;/b&gt; j = 1 &lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt; count // process them all&lt;br&gt;
count = -j&lt;br&gt;
// FSSpec &amp;amp; OSType&lt;br&gt;
action = &lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;( count, fs, fType )&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;IF&lt;/b&gt; ( action == _finderInfoOpen ) &lt;b&gt;AND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
( fType == _&amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot; ) &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THEN FN&lt;/b&gt; MyOpenFile( fs )&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NEXT&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; ClearFinderInfo // in Subs Common.Incl&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON FINDERINFO FN&lt;/b&gt; MyFinderInfo&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 1,0,1, &amp;quot;File&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 1,1,1, &amp;quot;Quit/Q&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;UNTIL&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as an idler routine to be called by the printer driver during printing. The actual number of times that this function is called depends on the driver and the hardware.

You may use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; vector to rotate through a series of cursors, check for a Command-Period key press, or update the status of a print job.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON LPRINT FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction &lt;/code&gt;syntax, then &lt;code&gt;userFunction &lt;/code&gt;must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code.

==== Revised ====

August 2002 (Release 7)

=== Description ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF CREATERESFILE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; replaces the obsolete &lt;code&gt;CALL CREATERESFILE&lt;/code&gt; which has seen such heavy use in the past. Mac OS X made the call obsolete, but by exchanging the &lt;code&gt;DEF&lt;/code&gt; keyword for the optional &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword, you can breath new life into your programs. The &lt;code&gt;DEF&lt;/code&gt; version of the call works in all versions of the system software from system 7.x to Mac OS X. If this call is successful, a resource file is created in the current directory. You may set the current directory using &lt;code&gt;FOLDER&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF CREATERESFILE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may also be used to add a resource fork to an existing file. Creating the resource file does not automatically open it.

&lt;hr&gt;

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON MENU&lt;/b&gt; {&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction|&lt;b&gt;GOSUB&lt;/b&gt;{&lt;i&gt;lineNumber&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;stmtLabel&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a menu-event handling routine. A menu-event handling routine is called in response to the user selecting an item from a menu. This includes menu items that your program puts into menus on the menu bar, but it doesn't include items in pop-up menus; see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;menu%20function.html&quot;&gt;MENU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function for more information.

When the user clicks on the menu bar, FB does not open up the menu immediately. Instead, your program continues executing until a &lt;code&gt;HANDLEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement is reached. If the mouse button is still down at that time, &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; then opens the menu, tracks the user's selection, then calls your menu-event handling routine if the user selected a menu item. Your routine should examine the &lt;code&gt;MENU(_menuID)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MENU(_itemID) &lt;/code&gt;functions to get information about the event.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON MENU FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction&lt;/code&gt; syntax, then &lt;code&gt;userFunction&lt;/code&gt; must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your menu-event handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result.

=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF CYCLE&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;min%&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;max%&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;var%&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

Use this statement when you need to cycle the value of an integer variable through a series of consecutive values and then back to the minimum value. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF CYCLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is equivalent to the following lines:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;INC&lt;/b&gt;(var%)

&lt;b&gt;IF&lt;/b&gt; var% &amp;lt; min% &lt;b&gt;OR&lt;/b&gt; var% &amp;gt; max% &lt;b&gt;THEN&lt;/b&gt; var% = min%&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;min%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;max%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be short integer values, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a short integer variable.

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a mouse-event handling routine. A mouse-event handling routine is called in response to a mouseclick which occurs inside the content region of the currently active window (but not inside any buttons, scrollbars, edit fields nor picture fields).

After such a mouseclick occurs, FB does not call your designated routine immediately. Instead, your program continues executing until a &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement is reached. At that time, &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; will call your designated routine once for each mouseclick event that occurred; your designated routine should examine the &lt;code&gt;MOUSE &amp;lt;event&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;functions to get information about the event.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON MOUSE FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction&lt;/code&gt; syntax, then &lt;code&gt;userFunction&lt;/code&gt; must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your mouse-event handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result.

If your program does not use &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;, you can use the &lt;code&gt;MOUSE(_down)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MOUSE(_lastMVert)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MOUSE(_lastMHorz)&lt;/code&gt; and many other position functions (outlined in the FB Mouse Group of the constants document) to track mouse activity.

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as an overflow handling routine. An overflow handling routine is called in response to any math operation involving a division by zero, or any floating-point math operation that results in a number larger than FB can handle. If you don't designate any overflow handling routine, FB will attempt to continue evaluating the expression, but the resulting number is unpredictable.

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a stop-event handling routine. A stop-event handling routine is called just before your program ends. This works whether your program ends as a result of a statement (such as &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt;), or a Command-period keypress by the user, or because it has executed the last line in the program.

&lt;spacer type=&quot;vertical&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;A stop-event handling routine is useful for allowing your program to do any last-minute &amp;quot;clean-up&amp;quot; work, such as saving files, before your program ends.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can't use a stop-event handling routine to prevent your program from stopping. Your program will end as soon as it returns from the routine. To prevent the user from stopping your program by means of a -period keypress, use the &lt;code&gt;ON BREAK&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;b&gt;TIMER END&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;TIMER OFF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;January 2, 2001 (Release 4)

=== Description ===
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a timer-event handling routine. A timer-event handling routine is called periodically according to a time interval that you specify.

Setting &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a nonzero value causes timer events to be initiated, which causes FB to periodically check whether it's time to call your routine. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is positive, it specifies the timer interval in seconds. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is negative, then &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; specifies the interval in ticks (a tick is approximately 1/60 second). Setting &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to zero does not initiate timer events; in this case, you can use the &lt;code&gt;TIMER&lt;/code&gt; statement to initiate timer events later in your program.

After timer events have been initiated, FB checks its internal timer whenever a &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed. If FB checks its timer and finds that at least &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; seconds (or &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;interval&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ticks) have elapsed since the last time your designated routine was called, it calls your designated routine again.

Timer events are queued. If the timer interval is one second and your program is otherwise occupied for a period of 10 seconds, you will receive 10 timer events as soon as the program becomes idle. You may flush this queue by using&lt;code&gt; &lt;b&gt;TIMER OFF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt; &lt;b&gt;TIMER END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Designating a timer-event routine is useful when your program needs to perform periodic activities at particular intervals. To ensure that your timer-event handling routine is called at the right moments, your program should execute &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; as often as possible.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can use the &lt;code&gt;TIMER&lt;/code&gt; statement to change the timing interval. You cannot disable timer events once they've been initiated.

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;March 2, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
This statement opens a serial communications port (the modem port or the printer port) so that your program can write to or read from a serial device. The optimal values for the various parameters depend on the device and the desired communications protocol; see the device's manual for more information. The parameters are interpreted as follows:

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;portID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Set this either to &lt;code&gt;_modemPort&lt;/code&gt; or to &lt;code&gt;_printerPort &lt;/code&gt;or to any port sepcified to a maximum -8. (Ports are numbered from -1 for the printer port to -8.) The &lt;code&gt;_modemPort &lt;/code&gt;value also usually works to communicate with a built-in modem. Some Macintosh computers provide different values. A Powerbook generally uses &lt;code&gt;_modemPort&lt;/code&gt; as the infra red port. and &lt;code&gt;_printerPort&lt;/code&gt; as the internal modem. USB adapters such as the Keyspan adapter will provide different values if the device is connected before booting as opposed to plugging it in after the computer is running.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;baud&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Set this to one of the following values: 110; 300; 1200; 1800; 2400; 3600; 4800; 7200; 9600; 19200; 38400; 57600, 115200, 230400.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;parity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Set this to one of the following values: &lt;code&gt;_noParity&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_oddParity&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_evenParity&lt;/code&gt;. The default value is &lt;code&gt;_noParity&lt;/code&gt;.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stopbit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Set this to one of the following values: &lt;code&gt;_oneStopBit&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_twoStopBits&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_halfStopBit&lt;/code&gt; (1.5 stop bits). The default value is &lt;code&gt;_oneStopBit&lt;/code&gt;.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;wordLength&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Set this to one of the following values: &lt;code&gt;_fiveBits&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_sixBits&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_sevenBits&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;_eightBits&lt;/code&gt;. The default value is &lt;code&gt;_sevenBits&lt;/code&gt;. Note: do not set this parameter to the values 5, 6, 7 or 8: these are different from the values of the symbolic constants.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;buffer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Set this to a number in the range 1 through 32,768. This parameter indicates how many bytes to allocate for an input buffer. The input buffer stores data that is being received, even when the program is not reading it, allowing the program to process data while data is being received in the background. The default value for &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;buffer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 4096 bytes. To determine the number of unread characters currently in the buffer, use &lt;code&gt;LOF(portID,1)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Reading Data&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;To read incoming data from an open serial port, use the same commands that you would use to read data from a file; e.g., &lt;code&gt;INPUT#&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;READ#&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Since it's difficult to predict when (if ever) the data will come in, it's best to design your program so that it won't get &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; on a single statement waiting for incoming data. Instead, you should execute a loop that periodically checks whether there is any data to read. This will allow your program to proceed with other activities while it's waiting; or to quit waiting if too much time has elapsed.

There are basically three ways to check whether there is any data available in the buffer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can check the value of &lt;code&gt;LOF(portID,1)&lt;/code&gt;. This will return zero if no data is available to read; otherwise, it returns the number of bytes waiting to be read. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;READ# &lt;i&gt;portID&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;;0&lt;/code&gt; statement. By specifying &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, you instruct the &lt;code&gt;READ#&lt;/code&gt; statement to return immediately if there is no data available; if there is data, the statement reads all the characters currently in the input buffer (up to the maximum allowable length of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), and puts them into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You can use &lt;code&gt;LEN(&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;READ#&lt;/code&gt; statement to determine how many (if any) characters were read.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;INKEY$(&lt;i&gt;portID&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; function. It will either return one character from the buffer, or a null string if the buffer was empty.


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Data&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;To write data out to an open serial port, use the same commands that you would use to write data to a file; e.g., &lt;code&gt;PRINT#&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WRITE#&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

&lt;strong&gt;FB Runtime Globals&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;FB has several reserved global variables. (See Subs Files.Incl in Header folder)

&lt;code&gt;gFBHasComTB%&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;105&quot;&gt;//true if comm toolbox is used...&lt;br&gt;
gFBSerialPortCount%&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;36&quot;&gt;//number of com port&lt;br&gt;
gFBSerialName$(n)&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;55&quot;&gt;//serial port name&lt;br&gt;
gFBSerialInName$(n)&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;36&quot;&gt;//input buffer name&lt;br&gt;
gFBSerialOutName$(n)&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;28&quot;&gt;//output buffe name&lt;br&gt;
gOSXSerialInited&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;66&quot;&gt;//[!]0 if serial inited under OS X&lt;/code&gt;

After any communications port has been opened or after you make your own call to the runtime &lt;code&gt;FN FBInitSerialPorts&lt;/code&gt;, you may refer to &lt;code&gt;gFBSerialPortCount%&lt;/code&gt; for the total number of devices (maximum 8). &lt;code&gt;gFBSerialOutName$(n)&lt;/code&gt; contains the name of the device. With this in mind, the serial ports can best be referred to by name rather than number when multiple ports are present or when USB devices are in use for the purpose of emulating serial ports.

To search all available communication ports use the folling lines. This is especially important if a USB/serial port adapter is inserted after the program has started.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gFBSerialportCount% = 0&lt;br&gt;
//&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;58&quot;&gt;This is for OS X&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; SYSTEM(_sysVers) =&amp;gt; 1000&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;gOSXSerialInited = _false&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;res/cd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; height=&quot;19&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; CD Example: CTB demo&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Week01:''' ==
Three teams and three phases created/outlined:

The teams:

 &gt; Design:
   o Development of the Colour Palette, Design layouts, Branding and overall Look &amp; Feel that 
     will be the confines within which the other teams will develop their products.
   o Creation of PR materials such as non-standard brochures, etc. that can be disseminated to 
     schools in the effort to bring the Surround Screen Video (hereafter: SSV) experience to 
     those places.
 &gt; Interactive:
   o Creation of the game concept, including the Wii-controller interface, and attendant story 
     script and characters.
   o To create the navigational user-interface and apply it to the touchscreen and website 
     templates produced by the Design Team, primarily using Director software.
 &gt; AV:
   o Naturally, the filming and recording of elements such as the real-life, curator character 
     (Mr Bush) as well the lazy-susan display.
   o Creation of a mini-documentary about the museum, done in coordination with Mr Bush. This 
     documentary would then be featured on the website and be part of the promotional material 
     for the museum and the SSV.

Three Phases:

 &gt; Phase 1:
   Colour palette, look &amp; feel of layout, fonts, livetype templates, motion backgrounds, basic 
   navigation mind map &amp; buttons
 &gt; Phase 2:
   Detailed navigation including all globals, plus applying branding to all screen formats
 &gt; Phase 3:
   To create at least one working prototype for every format (VR, touch screen, video 
   projection, brochure, touchscreen, etc.) and finally the client demonstration

The User and client profiles were discussed with the following notes:

User Description: Issues Raised:

 - Who is project being designed for?
   &gt; Grade school age children 7-9 or 10-12 (one grade-school, homogeneous group)
 - Approx number of potential audience?
   &gt; 40 per session
 - What is the attention span of the target audience?
   &gt; 30 seconds to a minute and a half
 - Length of media elements?
   &gt; 30 seconds to a minute and a half
 - What would hold the targeted audience’s attention and effectively get the point across?
   &gt; Action
   &gt; Noise
   &gt; Sound (surround)
   &gt; Color
   &gt; Fast paced elements
   &gt; Interaction
   &gt; Competition
   &gt; Keeping the actual audience in motion
   &gt; The idea of reward

While we are initially planning this with the target audience in mind, we need to not forget who the client ultimately is and what they want. Client is the Kirkpatrick Foundation and the OKC art museum.

Collective Ideas/Suggestions:

 - Segmenting the group, and moving the audience
 - Competition between the groups
 - Competitive scavenger hunt inside the virtual interactive museum (virtual flythrough), per 
following:
   1. Split the group in two and have them compete by interacting with a VR fly-through of the 
      museum (the manipulate where they fly) in looking for treasure
   2. Perhaps even better, have another group of their friends actually at the museum, and by 
      use of two-way A/V communications, they tell the team at the museum where to go and what  
      to look for

- Use the Wii-mote to control the virtual artwork inside the VR tent

&lt;u&gt;Initial Project Consideration&lt;/u&gt;:
A treasure-hunt competition where the group of children will be split into two teams and each team will use Wii controllers and their half of the enclosure’s projection screens to work their way through a VR environment of the museum, using various collected clues, to find all the objects or information before the other team does. Also in the enclosure would be a chroma-key wall where an actor/college student would show off media interaction by coordinating their movements and behavior with characters projected on through the chroma-key (Interactive team?). Leading up to the enclosure would be a tunnel-like entrance where the students would be introduced to the game and what’s ahead in the enclosure as well images and other aspects of interactive media via flat screens (Design and AV teams) Selling this idea to schools will require printed material (Design team) Other considerations:
 - What is the operational budget?
   &gt; Potentially $0- $200,000
 - What is the timeframe?
   &gt; This project is due a year from now.

== '''Week02:''' ==
Discussion regarding the look and feel of the final product, geared towards the user-profile from last week: 

 &lt;u&gt;General Considerations&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Team Leaders: What are you going to do with the selected software to appeal to and reach 
   children (what look and feel for the media)? Preparer a final statement for each team to 
   encapsulate this and post it on Facebook in the respective team blogs
 - Project concept is now entitled Surround Screen Video or SSV
 - Create a detailed list of everything each team needs from the other teams
 - Post what each team will offer on the Facebook, group wall

 &lt;u&gt;Interactive Team Considerations&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Further discussion given to the overall concept. A third possibility has now made it to the 
   fore, and that is to break up the main group into much smaller groups, as follows:
   &gt; The media intro that the children see before entering the SSV is now conducted live by a 
     college student or actor in front of the chroma key wall. On entering, the children see  
     the actor and realise it was a live performance.
   &gt; Initially, all the screen inside the SSV are used to give a brief, guided tour of the VR 
     museum interface, conducted by the same student/actor
   &gt; Once broken up into their separate groups, each with a Wii controller infront of an 
     individual screen, the presenter shows how the basic interface works – basically click on  
     a 2D layout of museum, and the room clicked grows into a 3D, VR model. Each group at each  
     screen will play games that last no more than ten minutes (approx) where they have to  
     figure out basic puzzles that are based on the art museum room that they are in. Overall,  
     competition could still apply at the as to which team solved the most puzzles.
 - Printout concept for high-school brochure: To avoid the usual trifold, create something that 
   folds out rather like the SSV would; i.e. from the centre out to create a circular brochure?  
   For more details, see: http://supercoenbros.blogspot.com/

 &lt;u&gt;Video &amp; Design Teams&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; What sort of transitions should be used in the VR tour when going between rooms? Do we want  
   to have something elaborate that switches between VR and real video, or something more  
   simple and quick that allows the students to quickly go between rooms? We do want some sort  
   of transition so there isn’t just a jarring jump that breaks the illusion.
 &gt; This needs to be placed along side the idea of having an actual live team actually in the  
   museum, if we still want to pursue that variation(?)

 &lt;u&gt;Design team Considerations&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; Select colour palette (graphics used will ultimately dictate this)
 &gt; Research other ideas on the web – other fads. Particularly look at the Hannah Montana site  
   and the game they have there that John mentioned.
 &gt; Remember that we will ultimately be selling the idea and its look to the Kirkpatrick  
   foundation and the museum
 &gt; Work on starting the collection of a large library of still images – remember the discussion 
   regarding needing only 1 second exposure duration before moving to the next image.
 

== '''Weeks03 &amp; 04:''' ==
- The colour palette is now on Facebook.

- In detail:

&gt; The entrance will now have a two-sided flap, black on the inside and white on the outside which will allow for projections to displayed on that white, external side.

&gt; If separate actors and presenters are used, the actors would use the chroma-key wall to play out scripted interactions with the characters displayed keyed-in there, while the presenters would stay up by the entrance.

&gt; The Project concept continues to tighten up. Over the weekend, a specific ‘story’ outline came into being that retains many of the ideas from Week02, but places them in a new ‘setting’:

 &lt;u&gt;Design Team&lt;/u&gt;:
 Story concept: A villain steels art. A hero interacts with kids to help retrieve the stolen  
 goods. There is no longer a splitting of the larger group into smaller ones. Instead, kids  
 will rotate using the Wiki-motes to solve various puzzles and games as they move through  
 various rooms
 &gt; There will be a maximum of three sets of games, repeated on each side of the SSV.
 &gt; An intro will explain the story and its characters. This will be, at least, partly done  
   outside the SSV, with separate(?) actor(s) and presenters inside showing the children what  
   they actually need to do. The chroma-key would be used by the actor(s) and/or Presenters to  
   interact with the cartoon characters during these intros.
 &gt; The games will need to timed at an absolute maximum of 5min each (preferably more like two  
   to three minutes) so as to allow for processing of some 30 to 40 kids with each one getting  
   at least some time with direct interaction via the Wii-motes with the media/VR environment.
 &gt; In workload terms, the games shouldn't take up more than 20% of the project; consequently,  
   no more than three games will be created and they will then be simply adapted to each room’s 
   unique environment.
 &gt; The VR room-changing process will now be a simple, click on the door, which will immediately 
   change the screen/VR environment to that next room.
 &gt; Use the colour palette and web research to come up with three design options (“think Web  
   design layout” - navigation, rollovers, etc.). Designs to be incorporated in layered,  
   Photoshop documents that include the original websites that were used as inspiration.
   &gt; Design to include Fonts, colour interactions, etc.
     - 1024x768 format
     - Ideas to be presented to class Wednesday and finalised by the following Monday (Feb 11)
   &gt; Also consult calendar pictures in Facebook photos

- Scriptwriters to begin adding more details for the concept story as well as modularizing the story as much as possible for each room, etc.

- That said, all team leaders will need to now be constantly checking with each other, as well as the scriptwriters, as the overall and specific scripts become more integrated. 


== '''Week04 Update:''' ==
After further communication, we now have some feedback, that a confirmation ''may'' be received as early as the middle of February, but it might also be as late as 01 April. Consequently, the expectation for the issuing of the grant affecting this class’s project work has actually been reduced to about 20%, since the deadline of Feb 22 must remain.

In light of this, initial proposals for the transfer of the concept to the Elsing museum were reviewed. The curator has agreed to give the class a shortened tour of the museum to familiarize those who have not been through it.

More specifically, since the animations company would not be involved in anything to do with the Elsing Museum, the initial concept is for a Lightwave-created, VR cave-environment that would replace that company's VR production of the OKC art museum. The curator even has previously made drawings of such in the hopes that this might eventually become a physical construction for the museum, and the Lightwave design could then act as a blueprint and would also feature in any future visitor’s centre.
 

== '''Week05:''' ==
 &lt;u&gt;Touchscreen&lt;/u&gt;:
 - This is to be the highlight in the middle of the SSV, since kids love to touch things!
 - Must be consistent with the immersive experience that we are developing – the large  
   screens will change based on the interactive commands (touches) made by the kids and the  
   presenters on the touchscreen. It is crucial that the children get to experience this,  
   because it is a unique feeling to change something on a touchscreen and that cause the  
   entire environment around you to change accordingly. It illustrates, perhaps better than  
   anything else, the ultimate power of interactive media.
 - Surround sound must also be incorporated to complete the effect just mentioned.
 - All that said, the central (or will it be up by the entrance for the presenters?)  
   touchscreen will be primarily for use by the presenters, at least during the first intro  
   that Grant and Sara have now scripted
   (see http://supercoenbros.blogspot.com/2008/02/interactivity-team-rough-script-262008.html)
 - The main screens use HD aspect ratios
 - Touchscreen can have a varied design from that shown on the main screens, but they should  
   all still be unified
 - Creating the touchscreen is what the teacher’s unction for ‘thinking website’ are primarily  
   addressing
 - Testing will be done on the teacher-station in the Mac Lab

 &lt;u&gt;Main Screens&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Wii-motes would enable the user to ‘move’ around the VR environment as illustrated today on  
   the teacher-station in the Mac Lab

 &lt;u&gt;Navigation/Mind-Map&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Interactive Team to develop, with class input, a non-linear mind-map of the ‘website’ that  
   will be on the touchscreen
 - Use Motion to create invisible nav interface buttons (Easter Eggs)?
 - Name the home page 'Art (or Elsing) Museum'.
 - Standard web interface protocol calls for no less than three, and no more than six, buttons  
   on the initial Home page

 &lt;u&gt;Interface Production Considerations&lt;/u&gt;:
 - It must be Dummy proof!
 - Have the interface tested, heavily(!), by someone who is good at breaking such things!
 - Text has to be legible by kids
 - Must be design-consistent (Button locales, etc.) throughout the various pages
 - Must have an integrated marketing look (unified look throughout)
 - Must have alternate methods of navigation: linear, interactive non-linear, drop-down menus,  
   voice commands. Voice Commands is one that fits very well with the interactive scope of this 
   project and must be a primary focus for consideration.
 - Have unique features in the navigation (do the expected, but also the unexpected)
 - Design for the environment (i.e. surround sound, touchscreen, Wii-motes)

 &lt;u&gt;Buttons Considerations&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Separate out Presenter &amp; User control routes
   &gt; Include project participants (e.g. museum curator, creators, students, etc.)
   &gt; Include the Creative Designs VR Tour (if grant comes thru)
   &gt; Link to external website(s) (needs live link or html files on harddrive)

 &lt;u&gt;User Controls&lt;/u&gt;:
  - Interactive VR tour (with audio cues/instructions?)
  - Treasure hunt
  - Web (online access) games


== '''Week05 (Pt2):''' ==
What are the most interactive items we have in this project plan?

1) The touchscreen

2) The Wii-motes
 &lt;u&gt;Design Team Assignment&lt;/u&gt;:
   Create a sample screen for every conceivable page in the touchscreen project.
   Considerations:
   - 17in monitor
   - Resolution: 1024 x 768

 &lt;u&gt;Team Meetings&lt;/u&gt;:
 &lt;u&gt;Interactive Team&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Presentation must have five working buttons. While these can be simple squares for now,  
   they could later be incorporated into the disc project as invisible hit areas, even though  
   this exercise is not directly related to the project.
 - Will need to use compression for the full screen videos
 - Discussion of how to use graphics or rocks/rock pieces for the Elsing museum variation of  
   the project, along with its attendant games
 - The Villain’s rampage would be done as a video piece, during which he inflicts the ‘damage’  
   the kids then have to fix in their games.
 - Discussion of the three game types to be employed: Puzzle, Odd one out &amp; ? (TBA)

 &lt;u&gt;Design Tm&lt;/u&gt;:
 - To have created a sample screen for every page in the touchscreen project


== '''Week06(Pt1):''' ==
- Elsing Tour conducted along with a review of how the goals will change if we switch to that subject (Those goals to be listed soon).

- Group encouraged to pick out things that could be presented as inspiring and attention-grabbing parts of the media display.

&lt;u&gt;Tour notes&lt;/u&gt;:

The museum is growing in its renown. Inquiries are now being received from across the nation, and so it is to the point where one can consider how worldwide exposure could release a whole new wave of interest and interactivity between schools around the world and the museum. It’s displays and information would be an invaluable resource for many classes.

Willard Elsing was an artist and organised his displays accordingly. His fascination was with God’s artistry as can be seen in so much of the raw minerals displayed. The curators want to retain that artistry look but also add in a focus on the educational aspects.

Appraisal: The value of the displays are kept secret for security reasons, but the administration has detailed inventory including pictures and even videos, that could be a veritable goldmine (please excuse the pun!) of resources for the group.

A VR tour could serve as the basis for self-guided tours? One problem in that is how to keep track of the user's location.

&lt;u&gt;User groups&lt;/u&gt;:
The most focused on are third-grade age (approx 12yrs old) children. A secondary focus falls on college and then adults in general

 The museum also conducts road trips, and there is a prime opportunity for an interactive media
 resource to completely change these:
 - An online VR tour would overcome the problem of gas prices for groups wanting to visit and  
   essentially make the museum tour to a worldwide audience!
 - The SSV could replace much of the current displays which would be reduced to a much smaller, 
   and hence much more portable, collection containing just a sample of certain specimens for  
   display.
 - Employ videos that use the most visually appealing items on lazy susans.

&lt;u&gt;Educational&lt;/u&gt;:		
Showcase the multitudinous products that come from all the minerals and crude oil. A good resource here is 'Properties of Minerals' case – which shows the tests for authenticity. The curator’s prime concern, in regards to media displays, in this regard would be the Tristate mines. Such a presentation would help on an educational basis and also in procuring further grants.

 &lt;u&gt;Artistry Considerations&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Natural sandstone 'paintings'
 - The silicate case that shows how the molecular structure creates the colours seen
 - Rams horn crystals – now only to be viewed in museums such as the Elsing which has one of  
   the largest in the world.
 - Hollow geodes that contain natural ‘pictures’ (Gods artistry)
 - Elsing eccentrics – One of the world’s largest collections of finely made and decorated  
   arrow heads, the oldest dating back 800 to 900 years.
 - The ‘TV rock’ made possible by parallel fibres 
 - Sam the miner
 - Lighted cabinet that when switched to UV light, shows off the other colours in the optical  
   spectrum that rocks also emit

&lt;u&gt;General Notes&lt;/u&gt;:
Construction time for the SSV setup is set at about one hour, with four people working


== '''Week06(Pt2):''' ==
Notes from meeting with animations company:
 - Has your company done any game design?
 &gt; No. But as they grow and pull in more talent, it's not off the table. This project could be  
   the doorway to that in collaborating with ORU students. They provide the business knowhow.
 - What is your perspective on this project?
 &gt; The business aspect - What's realistic to accomplish? They are considering the real-world  
   aspects regarding gaming and educational focus
 - Have you done any Cartoon Animation?
 &gt; Yes, a little animation, but it’s not the main focus of the company. Again, that doesn’t  
   mean that options aren’t always kept open.
 - How do you want the communication between ORU and Creative Animation to work?
 &gt; There is definitely a need for a Design team to facilitate brainstorming. One has to  
   consider design preferences v's realistic limits. A design team would work in that capacity, 
   acting as a liaison between them &amp; ORU using project leaders assigned from each side. The 
   company would need this in place 30 days ahead of the start of the project, once the grant 
   is issued.
 - How much design would be in the 3D scenes as far as artwork?
 &gt; They are very interested in the Wii-mote stuff. It's a large environment, but basic 
   creation can be done quickly enough using game engines for manipulation. They displayed a 
   head-tracking presentation from a YouTube video. It displayed the use of the Wii-mote to 
   incorporate head-movement controls for games and to create an immersive environment on a 
   traditional 2D medium. It essentially uses the Wii-mote and the attendant sensor bar, but 
   reversed in their roles so as to track the movement of the user’s head. The YouTube 
   presenter created the software to make it work. The video is about a month old. Imagine 
   that working on a huge screen! What about a training application? This could be the prefect 
   tie-in between ORU &amp; their company's work.
 - How can we transform your 3D scenes to an interactive, immersive environment?
 &gt; They are now talking about adding game engines to their videos and that would be a way to 
   bring the videos alive.
 - Will the company’s resources be available to the students?
 &gt; Still working on this, and have to figure out what makes sense for bandwidth. They may give 
   access to certain parts of their server. Maybe students could use their servers to render? 
   The game engine they currently have in mind is 'Torque.’ It’s not the latest and greatest, 
   but it does the job and is cost-effective.
 - What about matching the colour palettes and feel that are being developed by ORU?
 &gt; That would be covered by the Design team mentioned earlier. Coordination is necessary and 
   can be accomplished as the project progresses.
 - How do you see each side contributing?
 &gt; The students do most of the hands-on and their company provides oversight.
 - What will their company bring to the student's project?
 &gt; Meeting the client's wishes is the most critical. The company’s focus would be on that.
 - What do you think their copmany would want to gain from this?
 &gt; To build closer ties with the university and of course, simply to gain more experience. This 
   project would help advertise Oklahoma as a tech centre.
 - What is your insight into Kirkpatrick?
 &gt; He has met some of them, and they are definitely watching this between the university and 
   the animations company. They are trying to bring film and other media to Oklahoma.
 - How do you envision this project?
 &gt; They might add to the SSV project. A great example of using green-screen interaction  with 
   kids is Chucky Cheese. That alone should get the attention of the children. Otherwise, they 
   are still working and waiting on more firm ideas to develop. There may well be a documentary 
   made of how it was done, which would be produced by OETA (PBS). They would be filming both 
   the company and the university, and that will require coordination with OETA. The 
   documentary would cover meetings, DVD authoring, shooting video, general skill sets, what 
   was behind the motivation for the project, etc. A lot of production work will be required in 
   creating that documentary. This whole thing will require the full gamut of media resources.
 - Have you ever done anything similar?
 &gt; In their working with building designs, they have had to create kid-friendly spaces. So they 
   understand the mindset and requirements.

== '''Week07(Pt1):''' ==
The deadline for switching from Kirkpatrick to Elsing has now passed, and we are now to focus on the Elsing!

 Changing the focus to the Elsing simplifies the previous four into just:
 1. Max interactive experience for the class (the focus is now purely internal on the class 
    itself)
 2. The actual product for the Elsing


== '''Week07(Pt2):''' ==
- All three teams created a mind-map of their respective portions of Elsing museum project. Those will now be merged into one, unified mind-map.

- New suggestion: Use images of known people such as the children's teacher - record them ahead of time and integrate that into the presentation video - will astonish the kids to see their teacher there in the video!

 Notes on Mind-Maps:
 1. Use curved lines
 2. Make the line the same length as the word
 3. Only use one word cues/labels
 4. Colour coding
 5. Use icons or pictures instead of labels


== '''Week08:''' ==
Further ideas to consider after teacher’s experiences with Flight Simulator software from a recruitment fair:

- Have the SSV at any future college fair as an immersive experience. Present a 'game'/simulation that will introduce prospective students to ORU and give them a taste by using the simulation, immersive media to make them feel as if they are really there.

- After further discussion with the class, if funding should still come thru for the Kirkpatrick project, then there could be a class vote as to whether to switch back. If that turns out to be impractical, then the team leaders might be asked to vote as representatives instead. Regardless, if nothing is heard by next week, then there will be no question of turning back. For now, we continue with the process of transferring the focus of our work to the Elsing Museum.


== '''Week09:''' ==

- It’s now clear that it is not going to be possible to have a finished project for the Elsing Museum by the end of this class (before it heads off to NAB). So it’s time to set a revised goal, which will now be to create prototypes of every feature that is being proposed and then have the curator obtain grants to facilitate the completion of the work in future classes. So our job now is to pioneer the following, in prototypes:
 &lt;u&gt;AV Team&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; Create a video of the lazy-susan displaying six, chosen specimens. Take time picking the 
   specimens. Work out the setting and lighting and use HD video. If need be, the curator has a 
   lazy-susan ready to go. Suggestions: chroma key the background? How about making it 
   interactive by having a scrub-bar that a user could manipulate to effectively make the lazy-
   susan go forwards and backwards?
 &gt; Consider how to integrate the curator figure - Chroma keyed? Be unexpected and original. 
   Talk to Anna in ETV if it might help.
 &gt; Work on the idea of a micro-documentary, as long as it doesn't take over the interactive 
   focus of this class. Coordinate with the curator and decide on what, where and how  much. 
   Have the curator define 10 things he would like to focus on and then pick three from that 
   list to actually make the documentary on. After meeting with the curator, then get back 
   with teacher. 

 &lt;u&gt;Design tm&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; To create the 3D model cave
 &gt; Design a brochure-concept and disc labels using Indesign in coordination with teacher
   - Change the colour palette to match the focus on science instead of art. Have three colour 
     palettes ready by this Wed for the class to choose from. Post them on Facebook.
 &gt; To take the lead in finishing the web layout - a static, non-functional webpage, graphics 
   only (just the look) as completed as possible. This will be for the website and the 
   touchscreen, two products to complete graphic design on. Must include the Main pages and 
   also the ‘inside’ screens - splash and content screens.

 &lt;u&gt;Interactive Team&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; Create two hot-linked VR's - shoot and sketch out the concept. The exact scene settings are 
   still to be decided, but for now, just use the two display rooms that we toured a couple of 
   weeks back. Create the link to go back and forth between the two rooms. Teachers will help 
   with these VR’s and the hot-linking.
 &gt; Create the game concept – a 30sec experience as one prototype for demo presentation. As 
   mentioned above, the setting is still TBA
 &gt; Touchscreen functionality
 &gt; To work up drawings of the three cartoon characters, three still frames of each, showing 
   different facial expressions and poses. See the curator for the Rock Hound character. Submit 
   revised due dates for this work by this Wed.
 &gt; The script is in good shape but will obviously need more work as the project progresses 
 &gt; Work up the Motion and LiveType templates for all the titles, tags, names, labels and 
   graphics

''All assigned work is now speced out and assigned on Google docs.''

 General Notes:
 - The focus age group remains 3rd grade.
 - There are still three phases to complete:
   &gt; Phase 1:
     Define colours &amp; style – this is effectively done; although it must now be revised for the 
     Elsing.
   &gt; Phase 2: Complete detailed navigation including all globals and apply the unified 
     marketing brand to all screen formats. The brand work is being covered by Deanna’s work on 
     the website and touchscreen. 
   &gt; Phase 3:  Final completion of all work is due before NAB convention (the wed before to be 
     precise). 
   All the above must be completed in the next 4 weeks!


== '''Week10:''' ==
- Colour palette chosen - Deanna to publish and catalogue

- Interactive team to shoot a VR scene today, teacher will stitch the various hot-linked VR's 

 &lt;u&gt;Notes on shooting a VR&lt;/u&gt;:
 - Manual controls only
 - Set to infinity focus
 - Block models close-in
 - Wide-angle lens – benefits: less shots, close-ins possible. Blue-screen models to add in 
   later if needed.
 - Shoot near most interesting artifact, not necessarily middle of space.
 - Where to mount camera is critical- focal point is the pivot point of the camera head.
 - Custom-built tripod for these VR shoots. Head must be absolutely level - check two places, 
   90deg apart to make sure its level throughout the pan.
 - Make the 'sky' interesting
 - There are now automated stitching programs to blend all the images together
 - A/V team to put together an example of how to integrate the curator using blue screen or in 
   the VR cave or what? ETV's blue screen not body length - need further discussion with 
   teacher. Need to develop 30sec script for curator character.
 - Design Team to have first draft of script done by Wednesday, so that the curator can look at 
   it.


== '''Week11:''' ==

- Monday was the Phase 2 deadline - Interactive team will now take all the templates and add their content. All templates to be deposited in the server folder: Final Project/Final content - Interactive team will go there for the templates. Teacher to co-ordinate with the curator for a meeting ahead of the final presentation.

&lt;u&gt;Final Presentation&lt;/u&gt;:

- Each team needs to get a presenter to sell the project to the curator . Preferably, one speaker per team to cover all of that team’s topics, rather than one speaker per topic.

- Presentation scheduled for 3pm Wednesday, Apr 09 (the week before NAB)

- 30min max for the whole thing with Q&amp;A at the end

- In terms of notes/speech, one half-page, double-spaced ‘script’ is going to be about how much time each speaker has. This written script needs to be submitted ahead of time.

- Project Director to create an Excel spreadsheet breakdown of topic time-allotments

 &lt;u&gt;Topics for presentation&lt;/u&gt; (not necessarily to be presented in this order):
 &gt; Client/user description and project overview (presented by Teacher and Director)
 &gt; Screen templates (Deanna lead rep)
 &gt; Explain concept of cave (Silas lead rep)
 &gt; Explain game concept and script (Grant lead rep)
 &gt; Surround screen concept (Teacher to present)
 &gt; Present LiveType templates (Drew lead rep)
 &gt; Present Motion templates (LaQuez, if back in town, otherwise John - lead reps)

- The curator &amp; Grants Coordinator will attend the 30min presentation. Initial estimate for the completed project development is now $30,000, and the Grants coordinator would be the one to pursue the requisite grants.

- Interactive team: Absolute deadline for receipt of all content - Mon, 07 Apr at 0830 - Teacher to send details. Everything but the curator interview needs to be uncompressed.

- Design team: Maybe focus on a more grownup clientele for the website-look (splash and homepage) to address the parents, teachers, etc. Jimmy will use Deanna's layers as a template and do it. Hi quality, hi-res jpeg’s to be submitted to the Interactive Team.

- AV team: Blue screening of the curator (co-ordinate with ETV). Ben has script ready, and it has been sent to the curator. Because of the lack of a full-length chroma-key wall, only a Chest shot will be possible. Thence, the Curator’s image should be integrated into the rest of the media (Deanna's screen templates), and should also be one of the cartoon characters. For the curator ’s intro speech, create cue cards, or confirm he'll ad lib it.


== '''Week12:''' ==
Presentation Notes:

- Plan on using the Wii controllers in the presentation

- Team presenters to be picked today (Mon). Can be per team or one per topic. That person will write script today. Script is to serve as speech notes and reminders. There will be a rehearsal on Wed beforehand. Remember you're selling the idea, not giving a technical explanation. 

- Memorize the first few lines &amp; just remember the other highlights.

- Be relatively informal

(Documentary now to be done as a side-project between John and Roger during the summer)

      <comment>Added to [[Category:Advanced Interactive Media]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Advanced Interactive Media class of Spring 2008 laid out the foundations of a proposed immersive interactive project for the Elsing geological museum. This will detail that process and the reasoning for the decisions made:

- Why did we focus on the age-group that we did?

&gt; The Elsing Museum’s primary clientele are 3rd graders (ten to twelve years old), so that naturally became this project’s primary focus. However for the website, it was decided to focus on the older age-group that would encompass the teachers and parents, since they were considered more likely to be the ones to consult that as part of their research and decision whether to include the museum as part of their children’s education.

----

- Colour Palette / Design layouts / Branding / Look &amp; Feel:

&gt; The final colour pallette was chosen due to its earth-tone like look that reflects the project’s subject, namely a geological museum. Nonetheless, that was also balanced by a desire to keep some element of saturated, advanced colours that more naturally appeal to children. In addition, while the somewhat more dull look of the pallette may not be so appealing to children of the focus age-group, we think the media interactivity offered by the Surround-Screen Video (hereafter: SSV) elements, such as the Wii-controllers, the chroma-keying and the touchscreen experience, as well as the use of high-energy, child-friendly fonts (developed in LiveType) will more than compensate.

&gt; Similarly, there was an understood need to balance what could otherwise be opposing requirements in the look and feel to the VR environments, which would naturally be set within the context of a cave (designed in Lightwave). Normally, the interior of a VR cave might not be considered particularly appealing to children looking for an interactive experience, but the museum’s own artifacts come to the rescue in this with their amazing variety in colours and even picturesque, natural designs. Combining the two, with specimens interspersed throughout the VR cave, will more than resolve any balancing issues.

&gt; These first two items gave rise to a natural branding of the museum, and therefore this project, by showcasing the most aesthetic of the museum’s artifacts on an interactive lazy-susan display. This would be used on the website to give interested parties a taste of what’s available without the complexities of the more extensive VR cave environment.

----

- Scripting and Games:

&gt; The tone of any story to accompany the VR environments was naturally set from the beginning by the clientele, as well as any proposed length, taking into their attention spans. Initially, it was thought that competition would be a worthwhile interactive experience, with the children split into two or more groups which would then have a certain length of time to complete the challenges/games put before them. Eventually, this was relinquished in favour of merely running the games as separate entities which would nonetheless still fit into the context of the story intro presented at the beginning of the SSV experience.

&gt; The story itself was developed along the ideas of a villain who steals and/or breaks certain artifacts leaving the children, directly as well as through their VR alter-egos to solve the clues and repair the damage, etc. It is a standard format that easily lends itself to all kinds of permutations but is also simple enough to be a format that children are familiar with.

&gt; Both the story and the games were kept simple enough so that they would not become time consuming, but still retained the potential of fully engaging the children in the VR experience with the Wii-controllers. The story was consequently created with characters that the children could relate to, and the games broken down into two quickly-understood, self-explanatory categories:

1) The jigsaw puzzle

2) Identify the piece/item that doesn’t belong, and

----

 &lt;u&gt;Breakdown of the project&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; Phase 1:
   Colour palette, look &amp; feel of layout, fonts, livetype templates, motion backgrounds, basic 
   navigation mind map &amp; buttons
 &gt; Phase 2:
   Detailed navigation including all globals, plus applying branding to all screen formats
 &gt; Phase 3:
   To create at least one working prototype for every format (VR, touch screen, video 
   projection, brochure, touchscreen, etc.) and finally the client demonstration

 &lt;u&gt;Creation of the 3 teams&lt;/u&gt;:
 &gt; &lt;u&gt;Design&lt;/u&gt;:
 o Development of the Colour Palette, Design layouts, Branding and overall Look &amp; Feel that 
   will be the confines within which the other teams will develop their products.
 o Creation of PR materials such as non-standard brochures, etc. that can be disseminated to 
   schools in the effort to bring the SSV experience to those places.
 &gt; &lt;u&gt;Interactive&lt;/u&gt;:
 o Creation of the game concept, including the Wii-controller interface, and attendant story  
   script and characters.
 o To create the navigational user-interface and apply it to the touchscreen and website 
   templates produced by the Design Team, primarily using Director software.
 &gt; &lt;u&gt;AV&lt;/u&gt;:
 o Naturally, the filming and recording of elements such as the real-life, curator character 
   as well the lazy-susan display.
 o Creation of a mini-documentary about the museum, done in coordination with the curator. This 
   documentary would then be featured on the website and be part of the promotional material 
   for the museum and the SSV.

In keeping with the developing media world that is the focus of this class, communication was conducted primarily through Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2248278720)and a job/task list in Google docs (http://docs.google.com/#all)

As the weeks in this Spring 2008 semester began to pass by, a better understanding was gained about how far this current class could be expected to go in completing the concepts being developed. As a consequence, the last two weeks were focused on developing prototypes of all the material and concepts that will serve as the foundation for the completed project. Those prototypes were then presented to the curator and Grants coordinator who will then take those prototypes and use them in grant applications for the funds necessary to continue. Further development and the final completion will now be passed to future Ai Classes!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic setup of a bar includes a few important items. Some are obvious, such as alcohol and something to up it in, but some are less, such as pens, colouring books and crayons.

== Alcohol ==
The first thing need for any bar is obviously the alcohol.  Some of the basic alcohols include:
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Gin|Gin (dry)]]
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Vodka|Vodka]]
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#American_whiskeys|Bourbon]]
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Scotch whiskies|Scotch Whiskey]]
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Rum|Rum (light)]]
*Vermouth (dry and sweet)
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Tequila|Tequila]]
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Wine#White Wine|White]] and [[Bartending/Alcohol/Wine#Red Wine|Red Wines]]
*[[Bartending/Alcohol/Beer|Beer]]
*Cognac

Though these are the 'basic' alcohols, and should ideally be stocked in every bar, it is important to know your customers, if your bar is part of a five star hotel or country club, a larger variety of Cognac is going to be needed than in a small bar in a low-income area. Having said that, having a large mixture of bottles that are 'obscure' - that is, old, foreign, faded etc., just to give your bar a more homely feel, and they can be a good conversation starter if even the barman doesn't know what they are.

== Mixers ==
Any bar needs something to mix with the alcohol, whether to add taste, to lengthen a drink or as something for the driver. Some common mixers include club soda, tonic water, ginger ale, 7-Up or Sprite, cola, juices (tomato, orange, pineapple, cranberry, grapefruit, etc.). Other mixers, i.e., those mainly found in cocktails may be bitters, grenadine or even milk, coffee, or heavy cream. 

Garnishes such as maraschino cherries, green olives, cocktail onions are used as &quot;decoration&quot; for the glasses, and should ideally be kept in the front of a fridge, with tongs/fork/spoon nearby, should you need to get one in a hurry.

== Glassware ==
[[Bartending/Glassware|Glassware]] is also necessary.  The type of glass can make or break a drink.  Some of the more important glasses include Beer mug, Beer pilsner, Brandy snifter, Champagne flute, Cocktail glass, Collins glass, Cordial glass, Highball glass, Irish coffee cup, Margarita/Coupette glass, Old-fashioned glass, Parfait glass, Sherry glass, Shot glass, and the Whiskey sour glass.

Remember, when washing glasses - especially when using a machine - any cold drinks in warm glasses can cause them to shatter, whether in your hands, or the customers. Many bartenders can tell of times when as a customer was walking away, the base of the glass - and the drink included - just fell away from the rest of the glass.

== Ice ==
An important tool in the arsenal of any bar. Ideally, an ice machine would be kept in the cellar, with a large ice-bucket kept behind the bar with tongs or a small scoop. Remember, never put the glass itself into the ice-bucket, because if the glass chips and it goes unnoticed, the shards could cause serious damage.

There are many different types of ice, and many different preparation methods - believe it or not. Some bars only use crushed ice, that is ice that has been chipped or put in a blender, which looks nice in cocktails, but has a tendency to melt very quickly. Twice-frozen ice takes longer to melt, though has a more opaque colour that can put many off.

The best way to get crystal clear ice is to freeze warm water - not hot though, as hot water in a freezer can cause damage to the interior temperature control systems. Warm water is best as it slows the freezing process, giving a more transparent and attractive cube.

Some bars, especially those in Southern Europe, will often freeze a glass, that is put a beer glass in to a freezer and take it out seconds before putting the alcohol in, this can create a very interesting effect, and keep a drink cool without the need of ice-cubes; but, it does take up a lot of freezer space and can be impractical if you've a full bar.

lists:seq(1,100) is like range(1,101) in python.

 5&gt; lists:seq(1,10).
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

==sort==

lists:sort( A ) is what you think.

 -define(LIKERT_SCALE, lists:seq(1, 5)). 
 
 A = ?LIKERT_SCALE.

The code makes A = [1,2,3,4,5].

Some handy predefined macros include: 

  ?MODULE  (module name)
  ?LINE    (line number)
  ?FILE    (filename as a string)

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double sin( double arg );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

If you don't want cmath you can write sin function it is;

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

double sin(double x)  //sin function
{return x-((x*x*x)/6.)+((x*x*x*x*x)/120.);}

int main () {
    double a;
    cin&gt;&gt;a;
  
                                                            cout&lt;&lt;&quot;sin(&quot;&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;&quot;)=&quot;&lt;&lt;sin(a*(3.14159/180.))&lt;&lt;endl;
return 0;}



The function sin() returns the sine of ''arg'', where ''arg'' is given in radians. The return value of sin() will be in the range [-1,1]. If arg is infinite, sin() will return NAN and raise a floating-point exception.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Creating a Nightly Build=

==The Nightly Build==

===Prerequisites===

* [http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sitedocs/wiki/SSH%20keys SSH Account for the AROS Project on sourceforge.net]
* Space to store all the required source for your chosen packages,
* Space to store the generated binaries and log files.
* A valid svn account for https://svn.aros.org/ with read-access.
* An email account subscribed to the AROS dev mailing list.

===Terms Used===

;&lt;SCRIPTDIR&gt;:                            The location the nightly scripts are stored in
;&lt;Sourceforge SSH Account Name&gt;:         A valid SSH account on sourceforge with access to AROS.
;&lt;Nightly-Build User Name&gt;:              The local user account you will build binaries with.
;&lt;Dev Mailing List eMail Address&gt;:       An email account with access to the AROS Dev mailing list.
:                                        This will be used to send the log to the mailing list.
;&lt;Your Servers Config-Name&gt;:

===Nightly Package Names===

The build script uses package names to identify what to build for a given server.
the packages tell the build script which files in &lt;SRCDIR&gt;/pkg/ to run, which in turn
creates the chosen binaries.


====Valid Package Names====

Files which are common to all platform generally have a name that is just their target, with all as the build target.
Currently defined ones are 

=====Common Package Names=====

   sources.svn.all
   changelogs.svn.all
   documentation.svn.all

=====Arch Specific Package Names=====

   sdk.svn.pc-i386
   sdk.svn.pc-x86_64
   
   contrib.svn.pc-i386
   contrib.svn.pc-x86_64
   
   bootiso-grub.svn.pc-i386
   bootiso-grub2.svn.pc-i386
   bootiso-grub2.svn.pc-x86_64
   
   bootfloppy.svn.pc-i386
   
   hosted.svn.linux-i386
   hosted.svn.linux-x86_64
   hosted.svn.linux-ppc

====Disallowed Names====

   bootiso                            generic routine used by the arch specific nightly targets
   hosted
   sdk

===Prepairing the system===

Firstly you will want to set up a user account on your system that will be used to perform the build.
create a user 

   adduser &lt;Nightly-Build User Name&gt;

The first step is to obtain the nightly build scripts.  cd to the location you will perform the build in and checkout the scripts as follows -:

   cd /home/&lt;Nightly-Build User Name&gt;
   mkdir -p MyNightlyBuildDir
   cd MyNightlyBuildDir
   svn checkout https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/AROS/scripts/nightly

you will have a new subdirectory called nightly that contains all the scripts used to build the nightly binaries.  from here on in we will refer to this directory as &lt;SCRIPTDIR&gt;.

now cd into that directory and make a directory tree to hold the AROS source

   cd &lt;SCRIPTDIR&gt;
   mkdir -p Source
   mkdir -p Source/Contrib
   mkdir -p Source/Documentation
   mkdir -p Source/Necessary

Finaly create an initial cache of the svn files used to build AROS

IMPORTANT: You must set the correct LOCALE for your system at this point!!

type the following -:

   cd Source
   export LANG=en_US.ISO8859-1

then checkout all the source repositories needed to perform your nightly build packages.

ie...

   svn checkout https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/AROS
   cd Contrib
   svn checkout https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/contrib
   cd ../Necessary
   svn checkout https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/contrib/necessary

You may omit complete contrib if you don't want to bundle it within your archive. Just leave the corresponding directory empty.

===Prepairing your servers config file===

Create a plain textfile in the cfg directory called &lt;Your Servers Config-Name&gt;
Open it in a text editor and add the packages you'd like to build.

For example ..
   
   CFG_PACKAGES=(sources.svn.all documentation.svn.all sdk.svn.pc-x86_64 bootiso-grub2.svn.pc-x86_64)

To enable sending an email report of the build results to the dev mailing list add the following lines ..

   CFG_MAIL_ENABLE=yes
   CFG_MAIL_CC=&lt;Dev Mailing List eMail Address&gt;

And to enable uploading the binaries so they may be listed on AROS.org add ..

   CFG_UPLOAD_ENABLE=yes
   CFG_DS_USER=&lt;Sourceforge SSH Account Name&gt;
   CFG_BACKUP_ENABLE=no

===Performing your first run===

The first time you check the system is operational ... perform a manual dry run by doing the following

   cd &lt;SCRIPTDIR&gt;; ./build &lt;Your Servers Config-Name&gt;

And watch as it displays all your build output.

If everything went well and you have enabled the email logging in your server config, you should see a confirmation email on the AROS developer mailing list confirming the build completed successfully.  If you have also enabled uploading the files, and have a valid AROS SSH account on sourceforge, the binaries should be uploaded into the temporary storage location ready to be moved into the live folders on the [http://aros.sourceforge.net/downloads/nightly/ AROS.org download pages]

===Setting it up to run automatically===

You will need to create a cron job for the build step we performed doing the dry run.  You will want to add a command that is performed once every 24hrs, which runs the build script with your server's configuration and uploads
the created archives to AROS.org.

    0 2 * * * ( cd &lt;SCRIPTDIR&gt; &amp;&amp; ./build &lt;Your Server's Config-Name&gt; ) &gt; /dev/null

This will make the build machine attempt to build and upload AROS at 2am.  All output will be directed to NULL (except of course the generated logfiles)

==Adding the binaries to the AROS.org site==

If you are simply providing binaries for existing AROS targets, the previous steps should be enough to add the files to the AROS.org site.  If however you wish to provide new flavours of AROS then you will need to update the AROS.org site with information about them. Read on...

The scripts and page definitions to list the binaries on AROS.org are maintained in svn at
https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/documentation

To edit the files you'll need to checkout the repository and customise to suit.

===listing new downloads===

If you are providing binaries for AROS targets that don't currently exist, you will need to update the files which list them on AROS.org.

Edit the db/download-descriptions/&lt;Language&gt; files to list descriptions of the packages you build.
make sure and follow the naming convention used by the existing packages.

==Troubleshooting==

===Corrupt localised filenames in the binaries===

This usually means the source files used have utf8 filenames in the source repository caches resulting from the initial checkout being done when the system locale was set to utf8.

to fix it change directory into each source directory in turn and delete all files and directories EXCEPT the top level .svn directory.

now type ..

   export LANG=en_US.ISO8859-1

.. and finally do an &quot;svn update&quot; in each directory.

==Maintaining the Main Nightly Build Machine==

The main nightly build machine has the additional responsibility of running scripts to move the uploaded binaries to the live AROS.org download pages and clean up the upload directory. Other build machines don't need to run these scripts.

====Step1====

Moving the uploaded binaries to the live AROS.org download pages.

You will need to create a cron job that runs at regular intervals during the day, currently every hour.  This job however isn't performed locally, and will require an AROS SSH account on sourceforge.  Its goal is to move the archives uploaded by the various build machines into the correct folder on the AROS.org site so that they become available for download. It also deletes any old versions of these files so that only the most up-to-date version is available (there isn't enough space to keep multiple versions of each file).

    00 * * * * ssh &lt;Sourceforge SSH Account Name&gt; 'bash -l -c aros/scripts/nightly-update' &gt; /dev/null

This will make the server transfer any files present in the upload dirextory to the AROS.org site once an hour.  Again all output is sent to NULL.

====Step2====

This step removes incomplete or broken nightly build files from the upload directory.

    51 7 * * * ssh &lt;Sourceforge SSH Account Name&gt; 'bash -l -c aros/scripts/nightly-clean' &gt; /dev/null

This will clean up the uploads directory on the AROS.org server at 7:51am each day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Suggestions=

Here is a list of suggestions for Science Investigations. Please add/amend/extend the list as you see fit. This is essentially a [[w:Brainstorming|brainstorm]]...

===Non-coalescing drops===

Some industries will mix liquids by cascading one liquid into another, assuming mixing will be complete. These drops may prevent complete mixing and need to be investigated.

Recent research has shed light on this phenomenon: The fast-moving shiny drops that skid across the surface of soapy water. Detergents play a crucial role – but how does the concentration of detergent affect the drops? What about ‘non-ionic’ detergents? What about a surface of anionic detergents and drops of cationic ones?

Challenges: Making drop-producing apparatus, Researching the chemistry of detergents, Assessing the numbers of drops


===Thiosulphate/acid reaction (‘disappearing cross’)===

Chemical engineers wishing to check if turbidity is a useful surrogate measurement for whether a reaction has reached completion.

How does the reaction respond to changes in acid concentration (it is first order for thiosulphate concentration but varies from first to zero order with acid).

===How can we assess the amount of oil contamination on beaches?===

Various groups will want to assess oil contamination, and a simple quick method would be appreciated.

The method used solvent extraction. Sand samples were laced with oil and the efficiency of recovery was measured. The sensitivity of the method was also estimated.

===Synthesis and isolation of propanoic acid from propan-1-ol.===

Chemical suppliers who want to investigate production of this chemical.

Trialling different methods.

===Making biodiesel from waste vegetable oil.===

Motoring enthusiasts who want to make their own environmentally-friendly and cheap fuel.

Using methanol and sodium hydroxide it is possible to make diesel fuel from old chip fat.

===Analysing the gases remaining after burning a candle in a gas jar.===

Motor vehicle engineers who want to check the composition of exhaust gases.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is easy; it is readily absorbed with NaOH.

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is harder; an oxygen probe is very useful but otherwise oxygen could be absorbed by, for example, the slow reaction of steel wool.

CO is challenging; it will be absorbed by CuCl solution but it is in very low concentrations.

===Extraction of caffeine from tea.===

Suppliers or independent analysts want to assess the caffeine content of tea products. Chemical suppliers want to provide pure caffeine to clients.

&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;This method usually involves solvent extraction with a chlorinated alkane (e.g. dichloromethane or 1,1,1,-trichloroethane). With care it is possible to recycle the solvent and avoid health and environmental damage.

===Other suggestions===

*Investigation of weak acid strengths/synthesis of new acids

*Rate expression for tin/iodine reaction&lt;ref name=RSC&gt;In search of more solutions - Royal Society of Chemistry resource book&lt;/ref&gt; – kinetics of a reaction

*Nobili’s rings&lt;ref name=RSC/&gt; – strange colours seen during electrolysis.

*A transient red colour&lt;ref name=RSC/&gt; – the chemistry of iron/sulphate complexes.

*Liesegang rings&lt;ref name=RSC/&gt; – stripey effects in gels.

*Polarimetry to investigate concentrations of sugars. Suppliers of sugar syrups who want to assess their products.

*Flame photometry to determine concentrations of aqueous ions. Analysis of mineral water samples to check manufacturers' claims.

*Is the level of chloramines found in swimming pool water affected by temperature?&lt;ref name=IB&gt;Suggested IB Extended Essay projects&lt;/ref&gt; Swimming pool operators concerned about eye irritation amongst their customers.

*Effectiveness of two major washing powders on five common household stains.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt; Consumer testing organisation who wants to test commercial claims.

*Factors affecting the decomposition of biodegradable plastics.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt; Environmental agencies testing claims of environmental-friendliness from plastics manufacturers.

*Studies of infrared spectroscopy: nature and applications.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt; Applications include breath-testing for alcohol and testing vehicle exhaust emissions.

*NaCl and potential alternatives to NaCl as a roadway de-icer.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt; Highways agency investigating de-icers which cause less environmental damage - but at what cost?

*Synthesis and analysis of hexane-3,4-diol.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Calcium carbonate content of seashells.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Characterisation of New Polyethylenes Prepared by Single-Site Catalysis.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*An Investigation Into The Uses Of Environmentally Friendly Additives/Alternatives To Petrol.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Spectrophotometric Determination of Trace Amounts of Iron in Plant Samples.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*The effect of disulphide reduction on the structure, and activity of Yeast Alcohol Dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Investigation into the effect of pH on the mechanism of glycation of phenylalanine as a model of the glycation of the B chain of insulin.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Analysis of Vitamin C in Orange Juice through a Chemiluminescent Clock Reaction.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Investigating the Effect of Different Halide Ions on the Stem Volmer Constant.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Developing and Validating an Assay for Tissue Thiols and the Analysis of the Effects of Aging and Taurine on Tissue Thiols.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Relation between the Slow Relaxation Time and Foaming of Selected ICI Surfactants.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;

*Purification of ibuprofen from commercial tablets.

*Building a breathalyser.

*Titration of various commercial vinegar samples.

*Titration of vitamin C content of commercial fruit juices.

*Investigation in the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid ([[w:Aspirin|aspirin]]).

[[Image:Galaktoboureko.jpg|thumb|right|Galaktoboureko]]
The '''Galaktoboureko''' (''Γαλακτομπούρεκο'' in Greek) is a traditional Greek dessert. It is done with phyllo, also known as filo or fillo dough, which is filled with a custard of semolina refined with citron. It is served with syrup.

==Ingredients==
===Pastry===
*450 grams of phyllo
*150 grams of sugar
*6 eggs
*150 grams of semolina
*1 liter of milk
*the juice of half a lemon
*2 vanilla beans
*1 pinch of salt

===syrup===
*150 grams of sugar
*125 ml water
*2 spoons of lemon juice

==Procedure==
Pour into a saucepan sugar, eggs, semolina and mix. Add milk, vanilla beans, keep on mixing. Finally stir in juice of half a lemon. Whisk the mixture with a fork whilst bringing it to a boil. When it starts boiling, reduce heat and keep stirring for another 10 minutes. Take the mixture from the stove to cool. Whilst cooling, spread melted butter over each sheet of phyllo.

Butter a tray and cover with half the phyllo, sheet by sheet. Pour over the cooled down semolina custard and cover with the rest of buttered phyllo. Sprinkle with a bit of water and put in the stove at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|356°F / 180°C / Gas mark 4]] for one hour.

To prepare the syrup which will be served with the Galaktoboureko: mix water and sugar, bring to boil and simmer for about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice when cooled down in order to preserve vitamin C.

== Stress ==

Stress is defined ''on the average'' as the force divided by the area of the body over which the force acts. More precisely, we can talk about a ''stress at a point'', or simply a ''stress'', in the limiting case where the area (an ''infinitesimal'' area ''dA'')    approaches zero. The normal stress occurs due to the infinitesimal force normal to the infinitesimal area, while shear stresses occur due to the infinitesimal force in the plane of the infinitesimal area. (Note: strictly speaking, stress does not exist.  Elongation (&lt;math&gt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) and stiffness (E) do.  Stress is a convenient mathematical construct that allows easy manipulation of formulae) 

Consider a force, dF, acting on an elemental area, dA, at any arbitrary angle. ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt; = dF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/dA'' is the normal stress, also denoted as ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''.
The shear stresses are given by ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; = dF&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/dA'' and ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; = dF&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;/dA'', where dF&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; and dF&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; are the y and z components of force dF respectively. These shear stresses are in the plane ''y-z''.

Now, instead of an infinitesimal ''area'', consider an infinitesimal ''volume'' at the point in question. Let this volume be a parallelepiped with the sides ''dx'', ''dy'', and ''dz''. In this case there are, in general, nine non-zero stresses. They form a ''stress tensor'' represented by the following 3x3 matrix.


&lt;math&gt;
  \left(
      \begin{matrix}
        \sigma_x &amp; \tau_{xy} &amp; \tau_{xz}\\
        \tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_y &amp; \tau_{yz}\\
        \tau_{zx} &amp; \tau_{zy} &amp; \sigma_z
      \end{matrix}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;


Accordingly, in the ''plane stress'' case (taking, for instance, the plane ''x-y'') we will have a four component stress tensor. Further, in view of the shear stress symmetry (''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''&amp;tau;''), the above 3x3 matrix reduces to the 2x2 symmetric matrix representing a symmetric plane stress tensor. 
 

&lt;math&gt;
  \left(
      \begin{matrix}
        \sigma_x &amp; \tau \\
        \tau &amp; \sigma_y
      \end{matrix}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;


The shear stress symmetry holds in the three-dimensional case. This makes the above 3x3 matrix--and hence the corresponding stress tensor--symmetric: only three of its six shear stress components are independent ones. Consequently, the stress tensor has in general six different components: three normal stresses and three shear stresses. As already shown above, in the two-dimensional case the stress tensor has only three different components: two normal stresses and one shear stress.


[[Image:Equilibrium infinitesimal area.png|thumb|260px|Equilibrium in y-direction]]


Suppose the body is in equilibrium and is acted upon by the  forces ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' (per unit volume) in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions respectively.
It then can be shown that the stress equilibrium equations, in Cartesian coordinates, has the form: 


&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial \sigma_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial y} = f_x
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \sigma_y}{\partial y}  = f_y
&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, in the plane stress case, we have two equations involving three unknowns.


[[Image:axialload_Solid_Mechanics.png|Bar under Axial Load]]


Now turn to an example of the simplest one-dimensional loading of a body. Consider a rod, pulled at each end, along the longitudinal axis.


[[Image:axialload_angle_Solid_Mechanics.png|Bar with Section Normal to Axis]]


If we take a section perpendicular to the axis, it is easy to see ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = P/A'' where ''P'' is the load and ''A'' is the cross sectional area of the section.


[[Image:axialload_angle_theta_Solid_Mechanics.png|Bar with Section at an Angle]]


Now consider the case where the cross section is angled ''&amp;theta;'' with respect to the longitudinal axis.
In this case, we can resolve the force ''P'' along and perpendicular to the section.  The force components are, ''P cos&amp;theta;'' and ''P sin&amp;theta;'' respectively.
The area of the cross section is now ''A / cos&amp;theta;''.
The normal stress is ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt; = P cos&amp;theta;/(A/ cos&amp;theta;) = (P/A) cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;theta;''.
Similarly, the shear stress is ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt; = (P/A) sin&amp;theta; cos&amp;theta;''.

== Strain ==

The strain in a material is defined as the ratio of change in dimension to the original dimension, and is a dimensionless quantity.
It is denoted by the symbol ''&amp;epsilon;'', where ''&amp;epsilon; = (L &amp;minus; L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Here ''L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the ''gauge length''.

The strain defined above is called the ''engineering strain'' or the ''nominal strain'', and is different from ''natural strain'' or ''true strain'', which is defined as 

&lt;math&gt;
  \epsilon_n = \int_{L_0}^L \frac{dL'}{L'} = \ln
  \left(
    \frac{L}{L_0}
  \right) = \ln (1 + \epsilon)
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the engineering strain and natural strain are the same for small values of ''&amp;epsilon;'', and for the most part for the kinds of loads and displacements in this book, the differences are not relevant.
Also, it is not uncommon to use the symbol ''e'' to represent engineering strain and the symbol ''&amp;epsilon;'' to represent true strain.

In the infinitesimal case, we have, strain ''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = du/dx'', where ''du'' is the change in length for the segment ''dx''.
Thus, the total change in length is given by ''&amp;Delta; = &amp;int;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt; du = &amp;int;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dx''.

== Hooke's Law ==

''Hooke's law'' states that the stress is linearly related to strain for some materials.
This is an empirical law by Robert Hooke, who observed this behavior in springs.
Thus, for 1 dimension we have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma = E\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the constant of proportionality called ''Young's modulus''.
Note that we have considered this value of ''E'' to be the same in all directions.
Materials with whose properties don't have a directional variation are called ''isotropic'' materials.
Materials which have different properties in different directions are called ''anisotropic.''
The most common cause of anisotropy is the crystalline nature of materials.
However, most common structural materials do not have the same crystal orientation over large ranges.
Another cause for anisotropy is the kind of processing done on a material.
Some processes like drawing tend to create stresses in a particular direction.

Applying Hooke's law to the definition of length change, we have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \Delta = \int_0^L\frac{\sigma}{E}dx = \int_0^L\frac{P}{AE}dx
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \Delta = \frac{PL}{AE}
&lt;/math&gt;

From mechanics we know that a spring has linear variation of extension with force, the constant of proportionality usually denoted by ''k''.
Thus, the spring constant for a beam under axial load is ''AE/L''.
This can be extended to components of different shapes, so that a structure is an assembly of springs arranged in a complicated manner.

== Poisson's Ratio ==

The longitudinal strain is linearly related to lateral strain in many materials.
The ratio of the lateral to the longitudinal strain is called ''Poisson's ratio'' and is denoted by ''&amp;nu;''.


&lt;math&gt;
  \nu =
  
   -\frac{\epsilon_{lat}}{\epsilon_{long}}
  
&lt;/math&gt;


The value of Poisson's ratio varies from material to material, and is about 0.30 for most common metals.

Recently,the discovery of re-entrant materials has excited much interest. These are unique honeycombs and foams which exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. The allowable range of Poisson's ratio in three dimensional isotropic solids is from -1 to 1/2 (though some polymer foams have been found to exhibit a value of 1.0).

== Temperature Effects ==

Materials change length due to changes in temperature.  To quantify this value, the length and temperature must be referenced to a determined temperature.
The rate of change is quantified by the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, denoted by variables,  CoF  &amp;  ''&amp;alpha;'', 
By definition of strain, we have, ''&amp;epsilon; = &amp;alpha; &amp;Delta;T'', where ''&amp;Delta;T'' is the change in temperature (compared to a given reference point).
If we have a structural member between rigid supports, a strain of ''&amp;Delta;T'' develops within the member.
There is also an associated stress, which is refered to as a ''thermal stress'', however no stress is created in a member whose length changes due to a temperature change but is unconstrained.
Structural members whose cross-section is composed of materials with differing CoFs, present a much more complex problem.

== Energy Stored due to Deformation ==

[[Image:defen_Solid_Mechanics.png| Energy Stored in a Compressed Rod]]

When a rod is compressed, the work done on it is stored as energy.
In the above figure, the energy stored is shown as the shaded area.
Now, we know that the energy stored in a spring is ''1/2 k x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', for a spring constant of ''k'' and extension ''x''.
For a rod, whose constant is ''AE/L'' and extension is ''PL/AE'', the energy stored is ''1/2 P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;L / AE''.
From the above equation, we see that it is better to use long bolts rather than short ones as they will have lower peak load ''P'' for the same diameter and material, without doing any dynamical analysis.

== Elastic and Plastic Deformation ==

So far, we have considered members which deform elastically when a load is applied.
Some of them obey Hooke's law, so that the relationship between stress and strain is linear.
Elastic deformation refers to the ability of the material to regain its original shape after the external load is removed.
However, we know that for large loads, the material deformation is permanent, and this is called plastic deformation.
Metals which can undergo plastic deformation are called ''ductile''.
Materials which cannot undergo plastic deformation are called ''brittle''.

[[Image:plastic_Solid_Mechanics.png| Ideal Plastic Material]]

Materials for which the elastic region is very small are called ''plastic'' materials.
The above image shows the idealization for such a material.
The material ''flows'' when a certain stress state is reached.

[[Image:elastic_Solid_Mechanics.png| Ideal Elastic Material]]

Materials which are elastic for large deformations are called ''elastic'' materials.
The above image shows an ideal elastic material--in this case, it also obey's Hooke's law, and is called a ''linearly elastic'' material.
Note that a substance can be elastic and still not obey Hooke's law (''non-linearly elastic'').

[[Image:elasticplastic_Solid_Mechanics.png| Ideal Elastic Plastic Material]]

Most metals undergo elastic deformation for small loads and deform plastically for larger loads.
There is certain amount of increase in stress when the material deforms plastically for most metals.
However, the elastic plastic approximation shown above is good enough simple analysis.

[[Image:elasticplastic_rec_Solid_Mechanics.png| Elastic Plastic with Recovery]]

Note that material which exhibit such behavior will show what is known as ''elastic recovery'', where the sample will show some tendency to the earlier state.
In the above image, the amount of recovery is ''&amp;Delta;'' after the load has been removed.
Note that there is a residual deformation in the material in the unloaded state.

[[Image:elastic_strainharden_Solid_Mechanics.png| Elastic Strain Hardening Material]]

Some materials show increased stress during plastic flow, with a phenomenon called ''strain hardening''.
In this case they can be approximated with a stress strain curve with two slopes, but this kind of analysis is rarely used in practice as most structural deformation is in the elastic zone, and plastic flow will most likely be considered a failure mode.

== Shear Strain and Modulus ==

[[Image:shearstrain_Solid_Mechanics.png|Shear Strain]]

Earlier we introduced stress-strain relationship for materials under an axial load, where we found that the stress ''&amp;sigma;'' was proportional to the strain ''&amp;epsilon;''.
If we plot the shear stress ''&amp;tau;'' against the shear strain ''&amp;gamma;'', we get a straight line for material which obey Hooke's law.
Thus, Hooke's law can be extended to shear stress using the following equation: ''&amp;tau; = G&amp;gamma;'', where ''G'' is the shear modulus, and ''&amp;gamma;'' is the shear strain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Compatibility Conditions ===

In an Engineering Mechanics course, we use force equilibrium to solve for forces in individual members.
However, there were cases where it was not possible and such problems were considered ''statically indeterminate'' problems.
They require some constitutive equations to solve completely, and Hooke's law is such an equation.

[[Image:fxdcol_Solid_Mechanics.png| Column fixed at both ends]]

For instance, consider a column fixed at both ends, and a load ''P'' applied at the center.
Now, we know that reaction forces ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' act at either ends.
Further, using force equilibrium, we have ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = P''.
Here we have two unknowns, ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', but only one equation.
We can apply Hooke's law, with displacements ''&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;L/2AE'' and ''&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L/2AE''.
The second equation is ''&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', since the supports are fixed.
Thus, we can solve the problem.


=== Finite Element Method ===

Consider a rod with different cross sections ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and lengths ''L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that each section has an equivalent spring constant of ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;E/L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
If the forces at each node (where the area changes) are ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we can write equations in terms of displacements of each node and the spring constant of each section for the force ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
If the beam is fixed at both ends, then the forces can only act on the other nodes.

In the general case, if you have loads being applied to connected thin rods, you can use this method to solve for forces and deformations.
The whole structure can be ''discretized'', and the nodes numbered so that we get the matrix ''[k&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;]''.

This procedure of breaking down a complicated problem into a large number of simple ones is called the [[Wikipedia:Finite Element Analysis|Finite Element Method]].

The individual pieces are called elements, and in the above case we have used the line element.
For a general ''2-D'' problem, we would need to use triangular elements at least.
The matrix for a typical problem will contain hundreds of such elements and the size of the matrix be same as the number of elements.
However, as most of the members are zero, the matrix is called a ''sparse matrix'', and it can be solved much faster than the typical matrix you would encounter, say, in a mathematics course.

=== Saint-Venant's Principle ===

[[Image:saintvenants_Solid_Mechanics.png|Saint-Venant's Principle]]

So far we have been dealing with point loads acting at the ends of beams.
We have assumed that the stress is the same as ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; = P/A''.
However, this is not true close to the point of application of the load.
''Saint-Venant's principle'' (by the French elastician Saint-Venant) states that the stresses remote from the point of application of the load are not affected by the precise behaviour of the structure close to the point of application of the load. In the drawing shown, this means that although the stress field at A-A might be hard to calculate, at B-B the stress can be approximated as P/A. S-V's principle is consistent with many years of experiment and analysis, but has not been proven.

=== Stress Concentration Factors ===

So far we have assumed that the stress at all points in a cross section is the same, and by and large that is correct.
However, there is an increase in stress near the point loads and discontinuities.
The peak loads are a function of the average stress calculated by methods stated previously.
The correct peak loads can only be obtained by methods like finite element analysis.
However, charts have been published for several typical scenarios.
As mentioned earlier, the peak stresses ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a function of the average stress ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Now, we have ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = K&amp;times;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''K'' is called the ''stress concentration factor'' and can be looked up from tables for common scenarios.
The study of stress concentration factors is also a design guideline, and indicates the types of features that you should avoid in a real world situation.
For instance, the stress concentration factor for a fillet radius increases rapidly beyond ''r &amp;lt; 0.1 d'', so you should specify large fillet radii for your shafts or eliminate the change in diameter.

[[Image:stressconc_Solid_Mechanics.png|Stress Concentration in a slab with a hole]]

The above schematic shows the possible values of the stress concentration ratios ''K'' for a plate with a hole in it.
The stress at the narrowest section is calculated based on ''d = D &amp;minus; 2r'', where ''r'' is the radius of the hole and ''D'' is the width of the slab.
As can be seen, the stress concentration is not significant till about ''r/d = 0.3''.

Note that local stresses might not be as high as that implied by the stress concentration factors due to plastic flow of the material, since the stress concentration analysis is done for elastic flow.

=== Generalized Hooke's Law ===

Poisson's ratio shows the amount of change in dimension that occurs in another direction when a certain change occurs in one direction. The strain in each direction is the superposition of all the strains--the direct strains and the ones due to Poisson's ratio. We can therefore state the ''generalized'' Hooke's law as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_x = {\sigma_x \over E} - {\nu\sigma_y \over E} - {\nu\sigma_z \over E}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_y = {\nu\sigma_x \over E} - {\sigma_y \over E} - {\nu\sigma_z \over E}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_z = {\nu\sigma_x \over E} - {\nu\sigma_y \over E} - {\sigma_z \over E}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy} = {\tau_{xy} \over G} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{yz} = {\tau_{yz} \over G} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{zx} = {\tau_{zx} \over G} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that these equations apply only to ''isotropic'' materials (steel, aluminum, copper, etc.) whose elastic properties are identical in all directions.

=== Relationships Between Moduli ===

Consider an element which has stresses ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' acting on it along the ''x'' and ''y'' directions respectively.
Now consider further that ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;sigma;'' and ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;&amp;sigma;''.

The shear modulus can be expressed in terms of the Young's modulus:

&lt;math&gt;
  G = \frac{E}{2
    \left(
    1 + \nu
    \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a body undergoing compression, so that the strains are ''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.
The fractional change in volume is thus ''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Applying the generalized version of Hooke's law, we have, the bulk modulus ''k'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;
  k = \frac{E}{3
    \left(
    1 - 2\nu
    \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Pressure Vessels ===

Vessels, tanks, and pipelines that carry, store or receive fluids, at a pressure different than its surroundings, are called pressure vessels. Pressure vessels usually are thin walled structures containing fluids at high pressure. 
The design decision is to find the value for the thickness ''t'' of the pressure vessel for a given maximum pressure ''p''.
Since the thickness is much smaller than the radius of the vessel ''r'', the inner and outer radius are taken to be equal.
For the longitudinal direction, we have the force due to pressure ''&amp;pi;r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p''.
This is balanced by the stress developed in the walls, acting on the circumference of the circle ''2&amp;pi;rt&amp;sigma;''.
Thus the stress in the longitudinal direction is ''pr/2t''.
For the tangential direction, the pressure force is ''&amp;pi;2rl'' and the stress force is ''2tl&amp;sigma;''.
The stress is ''pr/t''.

== Specific aspects of strength ==

=== Brittle materials ===

When for a particular property a material shows a large scatter in measured data (e.g. strength measurement results of [[Strength of materials/Weakest link determination by use of three parameter Weibull statistics|brittle materials, or of threads with important variations in thickness]]), a characteristic value for, or the weakest link of such a property can be obtained by analyzing the measured data on the basis of three parameter Weibull statistics.

[[Image:torsion_Solid_Mechanics.png|Circular Shaft under Torsion]]

Torsion acting on a long bar tends to twist it in the direction of the torque.
The analysis is performed on a section perpendicular to the axis, and the sum of the internal resisting torque is set equal to the external torque acting on the system.
The following assumptions will be made for the bars studied in this chapter:

# Plane sections remain plane after the torque is applied.
# The shear strain ''&amp;gamma;'' varies linearly in the radial direction.
# The material is linearly elastic, so that Hooke's law applies.

=== Torsion Formula ===

We want to find the maximum shear stress ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'' which occurs in a circular shaft of radius ''c'' due to the application of a torque ''T''.
Using the assumptions above, we have, at any point ''r'' inside the shaft, the shear stress is ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = r/c &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''.

''&amp;int;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;dA r = T''

''&amp;int; r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/c &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; dA = T''

''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/c&amp;int;r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dA = T''

Now, we know,

''J = &amp;int; r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dA''

is the polar moment of inertia of the cross sectional area..

Thus, the maximum shear stress 

''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = Tc/J''

The above equation is called the ''torsion formula''.

Now, for a solid circular shaft, we have,

''J = &amp;pi;/2(c)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''

Further, for any point at distance ''r'' from the center of the shaft, we have, the shear stress ''&amp;tau;'' is given by

''&amp;tau; = Tr/J''

We only consider the torsional loading of simple circular shafts in this analysis, ie cylinders or non-eccentric tubes without splits. Circular shafts are most commonly used as torque carrying members in machinery with rotating parts (like drive shafts of motors). This is fortuitous, as the analysis of non circular members under torsion is not simple to perform analytically.

=== Angle of Twist ===

[[Image:torsion_twist_Solid_Mechanics.png|Twist due to Torsion]]

The above image shows the twist of a shaft acted upon by a torque ''T'' at one end.
We know that the shear angle ''&amp;gamma;'' is given by 

''&amp;gamma; = &amp;tau;/G''

For a shaft of radius ''c'', we have 

''&amp;phi; c = &amp;gamma; L''

where ''L'' is the length of the shaft.
Now, ''&amp;tau;'' is given by

''&amp;tau; = Tc/J''

so that

''&amp;phi; = TL/GJ''

The angle of twist ''&amp;phi;'' for a circular shaft acted upon by a torque ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' at a point ''x'' along its axis is given by:

&lt;math&gt;
  \phi = \phi_B - \phi_A = \int_A^B\frac{T_x}{J_xG}dx
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the moment at section ''x''.
Note that you can use the torsion formula for shafts with slowly varying area as long as they are circular.</text>

One of the areas where solid mechanics as discussed in this book is most effective is in the case beam loading.
The loads on a beam can be point loads, distributed loads, or varying loads.
There can also be point moments on the beam.
The beam itself is supported at one or more points.
The conditions at the support depend on the kind of support used.
If the support is a roller, it can only have a reaction perpendicular to the motion of the roller.
If the support is a pin, it cannot carry a moment.
If the support is fixed, then it can have a reaction in any direction and support a moment as well.

[[Image:beam_Solid_Mechanics.png|Simple Beam Loading]]

In the above image, a simple beam is loaded at the center by a load ''P''.
It has a pinned contact at one end, and a rolling contact at the other end.

[[Image:beam_moment_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam Loaded with Ideal Moment]]

The above image shows an ideal moment acting at the center of a beam.
An ''ideal moment'' is one which is not associated with a force.

The general method is analyzing beam problems is to find the loads, reactions, and moments, and come up with the values for the loads and moments at each section.
This, in general will be a piecewise function of the distance along the beam.

For loads, we set up axes and this decides the sign of the force.
For moments, we set the convention that the clockwise moment is positive.

==== Examples ====

[[Image:beam_example_Solid_Mechanics.png|Simple Beam Loading]]

'''1.''' Consider the case of the beam discussed earlier shown above.

[[Image:beam_example_r_Solid_Mechanics.png|Simple Beam with Reactions]]

The beam has reactions ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' acting on each of the supports.

''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = P''

Applying symmetry, we have, 

''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

So that,

''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = P/2''

[[Image:beam_example_s_Solid_Mechanics.png|Shear Diagram]]

The above image shows the shear diagram for this problem.
Note that the positive and negative directions are conventions, but it is important to choose one direction for positive shear and stick to it.
As can be seen, the shear value changes at the point of application of the load.

[[Image:beam_example_m_Solid_Mechanics.png|Moment Diagram]]

The above image shows the moment diagram for the beam.
The moment varies linearly from the supports to the middle. ''(The value at the middle should be PL/4).''
Note that the moment is maximum at the middle and zero at the ends, so that the effect of the moment is maximum at the center.
In later chapters we will see that the stresses and strains due to moments are the most important ones for beams.

==== Exercises ====

[[Image:beam_ex1_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam Loading Example 1]]

'''1.''' In the above beam, find the reactions in the supports and the shear force at a position ''x''.
Also, find the moment at that point.


[[Image:beam_ex2_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam Loading Example 2]]

'''2.''' The above beam shows loading by two separate point loads.
Find the shear and moment at location ''x'' from one end of the beam.


[[Image:beam_ex3_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam Loading Example 3]]

'''3.''' Find the shear and moment at each point along the beam with a point load and moment acting at two different points.
How can a point moment occur in practice?

=== Calculus for Solving Beam Problems ===

Methods of calculus can be used to deal with continuous load functions.
However these methods can be extended to point loads and moments by the use of the ''Dirac delta function''.

[[Image:beam_cont_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam with Uniform Loading]]

The above shows a beam with uniform load per unit length ''w''.
Such loads are used to model the self weight of the beam where it acts uniformly throughout its length.
This can also be used for the loading of, say, a bridge due to all the vehicles on it.
The individual point loads acting through the tires can be modeled as a continuous load if the number of vehicles is large.

[[Image:elembeam_Solid_Mechanics.png|Beam Element]]

Consider a beam with load per unit length ''q(x)'' for any point ''x'' along its length.
Consider an elemental length ''dx'' of the beam.
Applying force equilibrium for this segment, we have, 

''V + dV = q dx + V''

where ''V'' is the shear at the point ''x''.
Thus, we have the relation 

''dV/dx = q''

Applying moment equilibrium to the same segment, we have,

''M + dM &amp;minus; V dx &amp;minus; M &amp;minus; q dx dx/2 = 0''

Neglecting the second order terms in ''dx'', we have,

''dM/dx = V''

Or,

''d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;M/dx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = q''

The above differential equations can be integrated with appropriate boundary conditions to get the shear and moment at each point.


==== Examples ====

[[Image:beam_cont_example_Solid_Mechanics.png|Beam with Continuous Loading]]

Consider a beam of length ''L'' supported at its ends by two pins, with a uniform load per unit length of ''w''.

[[Image:beam_cont_example_r_Solid_Mechanics.png|Reactions on the Beam]]

The total load on the beam is thus ''wL''.
Thus, the reaction at each support is ''wL/2''.

[[Image:beam_cont_example_s_Solid_Mechanics.png|Shear Diagram]]

We have, the general relation for shear 

&lt;math&gt;
  V = \int_0^x q dx + C_1
&lt;/math&gt;

The shear at origin is just the reaction at that point (=''wL/2'').
If we take the vertical direction as the positive direction, we have, the shear at the origin is ''wL/2''.
Also, ''q = &amp;minus;w''.
Thus, we have, ''V = &amp;minus;wx + wL/2'' for any point ''x''.

[[Image:beam_cont_example_m_Solid_Mechanics.png|Moment Diagram]]

''The Moment at the centre should be wL^2/8''

Similarly, we have the moment ''M''

&lt;math&gt;
  M = \int_0^x V dx + C_2
&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that the moment at the origin is zero. 
Thus, we have ''M = w x (L &amp;minus; x)/2''.

=== Calculus for Point Loads ===

The above works well for well for continuous, smooth load functions.
But in real world situations, we have to deal with point loads and moments.
Thus we use the Dirac functions for a point load ''P'' at location ''a'' as

&lt;math&gt;
  P\left\langle
    x - a
  \right\rangle^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

and for a point moment ''M'' at location ''a'' as

&lt;math&gt;
  M
  \left\langle
    x - a
  \right\rangle^{-2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now the previously stated equations can be used under the rules for the Dirac function.
The function itself is defined as 

&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle
  x - a
\right\rangle^n =
\left\{
  \begin{matrix}
    0 &amp; x &lt; a\\
  (x - a)^n &amp; x &gt; a
  \end{matrix}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a beam of length ''L'' with supports at both ends and a point load ''P'' at the center.
From the Dirac definition, we have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  q =  -P\left\langle
    x - L/2
  \right\rangle^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

The shear at one end is just the reaction ''P/2''.
The shear at any point is given by 

&lt;math&gt;
  V = \int_0^x q dx = \int_0^x -P\left\langle
    x - L/2
  \right\rangle^{-1} dx = -P
  \left\langle
    x - L/2
  \right\rangle^{0} + P/2
&lt;/math&gt;

The moment at one end is zero.
The moment at any point is given by 

&lt;math&gt;
  M = \int_0^x V dx = -P
  \left\langle
    x - L/2
  \right\rangle + \frac{Px}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of the Dirac function, we have, the shear 

&lt;math&gt;
  V =
  \left\{
    \begin{matrix}
      P/2 &amp; x &lt; L/2\\
      -P/2 &amp; x &gt; L/2
    \end{matrix}
  \right.
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
  M  =
  \left\{
    \begin{matrix}
      \frac{Px}{2} &amp; x &lt; L/2\\
      \frac{P(L - x)}{2} &amp; x &gt; L/2
    \end{matrix}
  \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the above is a special case of the general method called Laplace Transforms.

==== Exercises ====

'''1.'''  Find the shear and moment in the above beam using Dirac methods. 

[[Image:beam_dirac_ex2_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam with Two distributed loads]]

[[Image:beam_dirac_ex3_Solid_Mechanics.png| Beam with Overhang]]

'''3.''' Consider the beam shown above with an overhang.
Find the shear and moment at points along the axis.

== Stresses and Strains in Beams ==

Given the loads and moments at each cross section, we can calculate the stress and strain at each location.

Consider the bending of a slender beam (one for which the cross section is much smaller than the length).
A moment acting on the beam causes a deformation called ''flexure''.
Let the radius of the [[w:Osculating_circle|osculating circle]] of the beam be ''&amp;rho;''.
Consider an elemental length ''ds'' in the neutral plane (for which the deformation is zero).
This element subtends an angle ''&amp;theta;'' at the center of curvature, so that 

''ds/d&amp;theta; = &amp;rho;''

If we move a distance ''y'' along the radius, we have the length of the arc subtended would be ''(&amp;rho; &amp;minus; y) d&amp;theta;''.
Thus the elemental extension would be ''y d&amp;theta;''.
For a small enough curvature, we have the distance along the neutral plane would be the same as the initial undeformed length, ''dx''.
This gives us the axial strain at any point ''x'' as 

''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = y/&amp;rho;''

Also, using the Hooke's law, we have,

''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = E &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = Ey/&amp;rho;''

Now, we know that a pure moment ''M'' acts on the beam, so that there is no axial force.
Or,

''&amp;sum; F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''

''&amp;int; &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dA = 0''

''&amp;int; y dA = 0''

The above equation gives us the location of the neutral plane.

Further, applying the moment conservation part of the equilibrium relations, we have, 

''M  &amp;minus; &amp;int; &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dA y = 0''

Now, we know, 

''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = Ey/&amp;rho;''

and

''I = &amp;int; y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dA''

where ''I'' is the moment of inertia, so that

''M = E/&amp;rho; I''

Or

''E/&amp;rho; = M/I''

Thus, we have the expression for the stress due to a pure moment as

''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = My/I''

Suppose the maximum value of ''y'' is ''c'' (the distance from the neutral plane).
Then, we have,

''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = Mc/I''

The quantity ''I/c'' is called the section moment of a beam and it denoted by ''S''.

''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = M/S''

=== Beams with Arbitrary Moments ===

So far we have considered beams which were acted upon by moments in the ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Suppose there is another moment in the ''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction.
Note that a moment in the ''M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction would simply be a torsional effect as the axis is in the ''x'' direction.
Now, it is easy to see that the combination of moments is, in fact, equivalent to a moment acting on a beam of arbitrary cross section.
It is fairly straightforward to show that, in this case, the stress at any point ''(y, z)'' on the face of the section for the beam is a function of ''I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''I&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;''.

=== Shear in Beams ===

Earlier, we saw the methods to calculate the shear forces on a beam.
Now we can analyze the stresses due shear forces, like we did for stresses due to bending moments.
We showed that for the shear force ''V'' is given by ''V = dM/dx'', where ''M'' is the moment acting at the point ''x''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Strength of Materials/Header}}

=== Principal Stresses ===

The general state of stress can be represented by a symmetric 3 x 3 matrix.

It is always possible to choose a coordinate system such that all shear stresses are zero.  The 3 x 3 matrix is then diagonalised, with the three principal stresses on the diagonal, and all other components equal to zero.  The three principal stresses are conventionally labelled ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''.  &lt;br&gt;  ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the maximum (most tensile) principal stress, ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the minimum (most compressive) principal stress, and ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the intermediate principal stress..

=== Stress Invariants ===

&lt;math&gt;
I_{1} = \sigma_{3} + \sigma_{2} + \sigma_{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
I_{2} = \sigma_{1} \sigma_{2} + \sigma_{2} \sigma_{3} + \sigma_{3} \sigma_{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
I_{3} = \sigma_{1} \sigma_{2} \sigma_{3}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hydrostatic Stress ===

The so-called hydrostatic stress, &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by:

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{h} = \left . \frac {\sigma_{1} + \sigma_{2} + \sigma_{3}} {3} \right .
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Deviatoric Stresses ===
normal stress - pressure
 where pressure = average stress

=== Mohr's Circle ===

Consider the two dimensional stress condition where the stresses are ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''.
We have, for another set of orthogonal axes '' x'-y' '' at angle ''&amp;theta;'' with ''x-y'', the stresses are

&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{x'} = \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} + \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}\cos 2\theta + \tau\sin 2\theta
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  \tau_{x'y'} = -\frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta
&lt;/math&gt;

From the above equations, we can see that for any stress states given by ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can find a value of ''&amp;theta;'' such that the value of ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x'&lt;/sub&gt;'' is maximum.
This value is called the principal stress ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for maximum) or ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for minimum).

The principal stresses are given by 

&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{1,2} = \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt{
    \left(
    \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}
    \right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the maximum shear stress is given by 

''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/2''

From the definitions for ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x'&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;x'y'&lt;/sub&gt;'', we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \left(
    \sigma_{x'} - \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2}
  \right)^2 + \tau_{x'y'}^2 =
  \left(
    \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}
  \right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

In the ''&amp;sigma;-&amp;tau;'' graph, this is a circle with center on the ''x'' axis, and the distance of the center from the origin is given by  ''(&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;)/2'' and a radius given by

&lt;math&gt;
  R = \sqrt{
    \left(
    \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}
    \right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

This circle is known as ''Mohr's circle'', and is useful for visualizing the stress state at a point.

[[Image:mohrscircle_Solid_Mechanics.png|Mohr's Circle]]

The above figure shows Mohr's circle for a stress state ''(&amp;sigma;, &amp;tau;)''.
The center and radius of the circle are obtained from equations stated above.
The other stress ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be read off by the point diametrically opposite the ''(&amp;sigma;, &amp;tau;)'' point.
The stress at any plane can be found using simple geometrical constructs.

==== Mohr's Circle for Common Cases ====

[[Image:mohrs_tensile_Solid_Mechanics.png|Mohr's Circle for Tensile Load]]

The above shear stress in this case is ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/2''.

[[Image:mohrs_liquid_Solid_Mechanics.png|Mohr's Circle for a Liquid]]

A liquid is one which by definition cannot take a shear.
Thus the Mohr-circle diagram is just a point.  (The dot should be on the negative side of the axis as the liquids can resist only compression)

For pure shear, the Mohr circle is centered at the origin.

=== Failure Criteria ===

In the case of isotropic materials, the state of stress at any point of the body is completely defined by the triad of the principal stresses. 
 
Now that we are able to transform stresses to get the principal stresses, we can use these stresses to consider some of the criteria (theories) ''postulated'' for the failure of materials in two- and three-axial states of stress usually based on experiments on yielding and fracture of materials in the uniaxial state of stress. According to such experiments, the kind of failure depends on the type of material. Failure of ductile materials (most of metals) occurs when the elastic limit is reached and yielding commences. Failure of non-ductile materials (e.g., cast iron, concrete) occurs by brittle fracture. 

==== Maximum Shear Stress Criterion ====

For ductile materials, one failure theory is that of maximum shear stress.
We know that the maximum shear stress is given by ''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/2''.
The yield stress, ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be determined by uniaxial tensile tests.
Thus, if the maximum shear stress theory is valid, failure occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/2''.

[[Image:tresca_Solid_Mechanics.png|Tresca Criterion]]

In the above image, the material will fail if the stress state is outside the shaded region.

==== Maximum Distortion Energy Criterion ====

[[Image:vonmises_Solid_Mechanics.png|Von Mises Criterion]]


If the maximum shear stress theory is valid, failure occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches &lt;math&gt;{\frac {\sqrt{2} \sigma_y} {3}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Failure of Materials ====

Solid Mechanics is the study of load carrying members in terms of forces, deformations, and stability. There are three length scales: Atomic scale, Micro scale, Continuum scale. In this book, we take the continuum mechanics approach. We will consider the material to be homogeneous and isotropic (unless specified). Thus the material properties are even when we consider infinitesimal areas and volumes. The alternative approach is to build up material properties from basic equations relating atomic forces and interactions, and extending it to larger sets of such entities (''e.g.'', ab-initio, molecular dynamics). Other approaches include micro-scale theories like dislocations to explain behavior of materials, especially for plasticity. However, the approach in this book is applicable to a large variety of practical problems, where we deal with structural members, usually under elastic deformation.

[[Image:abody_Solid_Mechanics.png|thumb|600px|Body with Forces acting on it]] [[Image:abody_r_Solid_Mechanics.png|thumb|600px|Body with external forces and reactions]]

The images on the right show a body which is acted upon by external forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_2\,&lt;/math&gt;, etc.  The supports provide reaction forces (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}_1\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}_2\,&lt;/math&gt;) so that the body is stationary.

In addition to external forces, which act at points on the surface, we can also have forces which are body forces (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt;), ''i.e.'', they act on each point in the body. Forces acting at a distance (Eg: Gravity, Magnetic) can be examples of body forces.

Consider a body which has several external forces acting on it. If a body is in static equilibrium, then every section of the body should also be in static equilibrium. Now, consider an elemental area ''dA'' in that section. Let the force acting on the elemental area so that the whole body is in equilibrium be ''dF''. We can resolve this force in three mutually perpendicular directions. Let the component of the force normal to the surface be ''dF&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''. Let the components in the plane of ''dA'' be ''dF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''dF&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively. Then for the body to be in static equilibrium, we should have:

&lt;math&gt;\sum {\mathbf{dF}_i} = 0, i=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;

There are three other conditions concerned with moments for completely defining static equilibrium. We will look in to it in the later chapters.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Great Depression in the Americas (Topic 11) ==

'''Background to the Great Depression'''
* The US’s production in the late 20s were sky-rocketing, stimulated by the automobile, radio, film and other industries. There was a new plateau of prosperity, but few saw what was coming.
* Prices on the stock market were rising at incredible rates.
* The crash was partially triggered by the fact that the British had raised interest rates to try and bring back capital lured abroad by American investors.
* Foreign investors and local speculators decided to sell their “insecure” stocks which led up to a selling frenzy. 
* On October 29th 1929, 16,410,030 shares of stocks were sold; the day was also known as the Black Tuesday.
* As the supply of stocks in the market increase the price decreases. With low prices for stocks the demand for them decreases and there is less activity in the stock market. People with stocks lose out as the value for their stocks decrease and there is no demand.
* By the end of 1929 stockholders had lost $40 billion
* The stock market crash triggered a world-wide depression and by the end of the 30s more than 4 million workers in the US were jobless.
* Over five thousand banks collapsed in the first three years of the depression and took with them the life savings of tens of thousands of people.


'''Causes of the Depression'''
* The reason for the depression was overproduction in the agricultural and industrial sector.
* There was too much production and not enough consumption.
* More money was going into the hands of the wealthy that invested and increased productions, but not enough to the workers in terms of salaries. There was a lack of purchasing power.
* Another reason was credit through installment; these methods caused many consumers to spend more than they could afford thus bringing them into bankruptcy. 
* The rise in unemployment due to new labor-saving technologies also played a part in the depression.
* Financial problems abroad also helped to trigger the depression. There was the lack of international trade due to problems facing European nations.
* Europe had not recovered fully from WW1 and the financial collapse aided to the depression.
* The Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930 was designed as a protective tariff that placed a 38.5% duty on nonfree goods; it was designed to protect the local agricultural industry. The tariff also helped in the decline of international trade.
* Hoover’s Fight against the Depression
* Initially began with “Laissez-Faire” policies but moved to more intervention type ones towards the end of his presidency.
* He fought against schemes that he saw as “socialistic”.
* Hoover sought to use public works to get the economy running again. He was granted $2.25 billion from Congress for the projects.
* Hoover Dam (1930 – 1936)
* In 1932 the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was started. It was a government lending bank that provided indirect relief by helping insurance companies, banks, agricultural organizations, railroads and governments. “Pump-Priming”
* Congress passed the Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act in 1932 to give more rights for labor. Under the act there would be no “anti-union” acts and unions had the right to do boycotts, strikes and peaceful picketing.


'''FDR and the New Deal'''
* FDR’s New Deal programs aimed at three R’s – Relief, Recovery and Reform.
* Congress gave FDR extraordinary blank-check powers for his New Deal program.
* The Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 gave FDR the power to regulate bank transactions and foreign exchange and also to reopen solvent banks.
* He used the radio for his “fireside chats” in which he persuaded the 35 million Americans that it was safe to put their money in reopened banks. People had then started to deposit and banks were opening up once again.
* The Glass-Steagall Banking Reform Act created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which insured deposits of up to $5000, this further increased the confidence in depositing money and ended several bank failures.
* The gold standard is a monetary system in which the normal economic unit of account is a fixed weight of gold coin. Under the gold standard, banknote issuers can redeem notes, upon demand, in that amount of gold coin.
* At the time the gold reserve was declining and to prevent any sort of chaos he forced all private holdings of gold to be surrendered to the Treasury in exchange for paper notes. The value of the currency would become unmanageably high since the price of gold was increasing due to its growing scarcity. He then took the nation off the gold standards to maintain a more “managed economy”. 
* With the new “managed currency”, that was a result of the US leaving the Gold Standard, was aimed to bring about inflation in the economy. Since the price of the dollar was not allowed to increase with the price of gold the prices of goods in the market rose but not the price of dollar; thus resulting in inflation where the price of goods increase. FDR believed that the increased levels of inflation would stimulate new production.
* However, he brought the country back later to Gold Standards for purposes of international trade only.


'''FDR’s Alphabet Agencies'''
* The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) provided jobs for about 3 million young men. Jobs were in reforestation, fire-fighting, flood control, and swamp drainage. They were forced to send their pay home to support their families.
* The Federal Relief Act (FERA) was designed to employ millions of unemployed adults. The agency was granted about $3 billion to put adults to work on various work projects.
* The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) made available millions of dollars to help farmers with their mortgages on lands. 
* The Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) was designed to refinance mortgages on normal homes and was successful in helping millions of families. The agency helped to move middle-class support to the Democratic Party. 
* The Civil Works Administration (CWA) was under the FERA and it gave temporary jobs during the winter emergency, jobs such as leaf-raking were given to fight unemployment.
* The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was launched in 1935 to provide employment on useful projects. $11 billion was spent on thousands of new buildings, bridges and roads.
* The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was the most complex and far-reaching out of all the schemes. It managed to combine immediate relief with long-range recovery and reform. Labor hours were to be reduced so that more people could be employed, and minimum wages were set. It also benefited labor as antiunion activities were forbidden.
* The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) would pay farmers to reduce their crop acreage to eliminate price-dropping surpluses. Through “artificial scarcity” the prices were brought back higher to original parity prices that were in place before the depression. It would make up for the payments by taxing flour millers and other food processors. It was later changed to the second AAA two years later, now farmers would only receive payments on specific commodities such as wheat and cotton.
* The Wagner Act of 1935 created the National Labor Relations Board and reasserted the right of labor to self-organize and bargain collectively. The Act gave the workers a voice.
* FDR supported unions and persuaded workers to be part of unions.
* FDR won the election again in 1937 and promised to continue working the “New Deal”.
* His second term was not as successful as his first. In 1937 there was a depression-in-the-depression, social security taxes began to bite into payrolls and the government started to cut back on spending. FDR was now adopting the “Keynesian” methodology.
* By 1938 the “New Deal” had lost most of its momentum.
* People complained of the New Deal saying that it “pampered” the labor and farmers and not so much the middle and upper class. People said that it was a “Planned Economy”, and that there was “Creeping Socialism”. People also spoke badly about FDR’s blank-check powers and said he had too much of it.
* Economists believe that even after billions spent on “Priming the Pump” the gap between production and consumption did not close.
* FDR provided bold reform without a bloody revolution. He helped preserve American democracy at a time when socialism seemed more favorable.


'''Argentina and the rule of the Concordancia'''
* Depression occurred during Yrigoyen’s second term (1928 – 1930)
* The Radicals suffered a terrible blow after the Depression had hit Argentina.
* Exports dropped by 40% and foreign investment stopped.
* Unemployment was widespread.
* The government was severely affected as it depended on import duties for most of its revenues.
* The government had incurred huge deficits and tried to cover for it by borrowing. It was not at competition for credit with the landed elite, who also needed credit to survive with the decline in the amount of exports.
* Yrigoyen did not have the support of the elite nor the military and he was seen as senile and corrupt, he had become the scapegoat. He was incapable of ruling Argentina at a time of crisis and this ruined the party.
* Yrigoyen has finally overthrown by the military in 1930.
* General Uriburu had control of the military, which had abolished democracy by taking out Yrigoyen.
* He later created a coalition called the Concordancia which was composed of the conservative aristocrats, the church and the military. Using corrupt practices the Concordancia had soon won control of the national government
* His regime was oppressive and worked to eliminate any social opposition, or worked to leave them dispersed and or defenseless.


'''The Concordancia’s Fight against the Depression'''
* The Concordancia worked to remove Argentina from the financial crisis by abandoning free-trade and through conservative economic policies such as state intervention. They wanted to protect Argentina from the cyclical effects of the world capitalist economy.
* The main foreign market; Great Britain, was protected by establishing a currency-exchange system that went against non-British imports. They also set up import-substitution industries using foreign investment.
* US firms started businesses in Argentina as it was difficult to export due to high tariffs and the discriminatory exchange system. Foreign investment played a crucial role during the 30s and was 50% of the total capital investment in the Argentine industry.
* The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 promised Argentina a fixed portion of the British chilled beef market and eliminated tariffs on wheat. Argentina in return reduced tariffs on British goods and promised to spend its British earnings on British goods.
* Economy improved after 1934; wheat and meat prices rose, industrial investment returned to pre-depression levels and unemployment dropped.
* The labor unions were becoming bigger and more powerful, especially the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and had memberships of between 300 – 350 thousand. The CGT gained power and overthrew the Concordancia in 1944.


'''Brazil under Vargas'''
* During the depression Brazil’s exchange rate plummeted and foreign credit dried up. It was now impossible to finance the coffee valorization program, which later collapsed leaving behind huge amounts of debt. 
* Vargas worked on the coffee valorization program and attempted to bring the coffee industry back on its feet.
* He used classic valorization methods such as the restriction of plantings, the purchase of surplus stocks, and burning excess coffee. However, the coffee industry did not grow in the 30s.
* The agricultural sector had more success with the labor from the coffee plants. Cotton exports rose until the 40s, however the exports could not make up for the huge amounts of imports occurring.


'''Import Substitution Methods'''
* Vargas implemented import substitution methods through industrialization to improve the local economy. 
* He placed exchange controls, import quotas, tax incentives, and lower duties on imported machinery and materials and long-term loans at low interest rates to stimulate the local industries.
* Industrial production increased by double from 1931 to 1936, even when the US was still in depression Brazil’s national income had begun to rise.
* The Brazilian economy was no longer dependent on outside factors.
* In 1940 a Five-Year Plan was announced to expand the heavy industries and the railroad system.
* National Motor Company, National Steel Company at the Volta Redonda plant, National Petroleum Company to push the search for oil.
* Achieved self-sufficiency; autocracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Q1 - Objective Questions ==
=== Ideal Gas Mixtures ===
For a student who missed the tricky part of this question, it is going to be very confusing, because he would be left wondering if there is anything that has to be taken upto liquid helium temperature to be liquefied. The point here is that ideal gases are assumed to have zero intermolecular forces. No matter what the conditions are, they just do not have any IMF whatsoever to be liquefied! Check back the assumptions for ideal gas.

=== Balmer Series ===
The Balmer series corresponds to the energy level transition from some orbit to n=2. The shortest wavelength would be the one with the most energetic transition -  naturally, n  ∞

&lt;math&gt;v = R_H\left(\frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{\infty^2}\right)=\frac{R_H}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

If we were to find the wavelength, using 1240/E (simplified equation of E = hc/λ) would’ve been advisable.
&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;27419.25 how do you this find  cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
====A little warning====
The point here is, people mess up in calculation. They might use the latter equation and then take its reciprocal - this at a time when they just require plugging in the value of Rhydberg's constant from the question paper!

This is the point of such easy questions, people who just browse the theory and equations before an examination under an illusion that the numerical problems would require only value substitution will slog here! The following applies to the students studying Science at SCHOOL in a laid back environment.

Personally, I have met many many people who take the Phy/Chem textbook and start reading it, skipping even the easiest in-text problems! Remember, we skip those questions because we do not want to think about them, because it is painful to think and hinder your pace when you want to READ pages in a hurry. These are those students who have a hilarious criterion of what they understand and what they don’t! If they have heard some terms from a chapter and have an idea of what the topics are, they feel they're ready for the chapter in the examination. If they have never bothered to read it, they say they are yet to study it! In the end, each and every examination they answer is disastrous.

Now, isn't it funny? And believe me; a lot of such students are people who have scored 90+ percents in their SSC, signifying that they are quite capable of studying HSC. You make the choice. Why ever do you want to read a Physics/Chemistry chapter when you do not even want to think about it? And why do you not want to think about it? Is it because you do not want to know that you did not understand what you read just five minutes ago?

My personal advice is very simple – give a text one reading at the most before you move onto the exercises. The most productive part of your studying would be searching the textbook for details when you need them in exercises!

=== Rate Constant ===
Just recall the Arrhenius equation. K = A(e)^(-Ea/RT) When T tends towards infinity, the exponential term will tend towards 1, giving the value of the rate constant at infinite temperature = A.

=== Ratio of RMS velocities ===
Simple application of RMS = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt\frac{3RT}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the ratio, The required answer is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt\frac{M_\left(oxygen\right) T_\left(hydrogen\right)}{ T_\left(oxygen\right) M_\left(hydrogen\right)} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

==== Note ====
By the way, most people, including relatively better placed students; make a little mistake of substituting molar masses in gm/mol in the equation of RMS speed. Whether or not you convert it into Kg/Mol, it will not matter here (because its a ratio that we calculated) but will introduce a BIG error (if at all you can call it an error and not a mistake!) in the calculation of the absolute value.

=== Orbital Angular Momentum ===
This is a trivial piece of information. The orbital angular momentum is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt\left(l\right)\left(l+1\right)h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.

(nh/2π) is the angular momentum.

At this point of time, you might want to revise all the quantum numbers and their significance, including names etc. Such important but trivial info is very valuable for some rank deciding marks at the JEE. For example, checkout the Matrix Match question of JEE 2008 on quantum numbers. Not many people get it right because of lack of revision.

==== Note to editors ====
Write a note distinguishing the two quantities and supply convincing information, maybe from wikipedia.

&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;The editor can be anyone - you, some professor or even me when I am free.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
==Question 2 - Redox based question==

==Question 3 - On Organic Chemistry==
===(i) Mechanism of dehydration of alcohol===
For those who have a general degree of awareness in Organic Chemistry, the answer is &lt;font color=red&gt;protonation of alcohol, followed by generation of a 2 degree carbocation. This intermediate immediately changes to the more stable three degree carbocation by a methyl shift. This carbocation is the one which eliminates the beta Proton to give the alkene.&lt;/font&gt;

The reaction given is the generation of alkene in the presence of acid from an alcohol. More precisely, it is the dehydration of that alcohol by the acid.

The mechanism is very simple, 
* First the alcohol is protonated and H2O leaves.
* Then, since the carbocation so formed has no nucleophile to react with, it eliminates a β proton to give the alkene. Now, the product that we would expect is 2,2dimethylbut-1-ene.

The produced product is not that. Infact, the actual product that is obtained has a different carbon skeleton than the alcohol! This is because the formed carbocation is 2 degree. This particular carbon skeleton permits the formation of a more stable carbocation (3 degree) through a methyl shift. This is the major point.

* β deprotonation occurs on the rearranged carbocation and we get the alkene.

==== Checkpoints ====
We made a little point that deprotonation occurs because the carbocation has no nucleophile to react with? But, isn't the lone pair on oxygen in some other alcohol molecule a nucleophile? Will it not react with the carbocation? You give us the answer. [Hint: Check the mechanisms of dehydration of alcohol, there are two possible products under different reaction conditions.]

Also, some people are of the opinion that a two degree carbocation does not form at all! that is to say, it rearranges as soon as it forms to give a three degree carbocation. Now, the logic conveyed is a very obvious one and cannot be explained in more simple words. The point is, can you visualize whatever that was said? Think of a transition state mechanism as in your SN2 reactions.

=== Order of acidity ===
The order of acidity is decided qualitatively by the stability of the conjugate base. But the sad thing is, many many students do not even know what a conjugate acid/base pair is. Being unable to solve Ionic equilibrium questions is one thing and not knowing the basics is another!

The conjugate bases of the substituted phenols will all have a negative charge on the whole molecule. We say it is on the whole molecule and not on the oxygen atom because the anion is a resonance hybrid of various canonical structures with the negative charge on different positions. &lt;font color = red&gt;&lt;B&gt;The resonance hybrid with maximum dispersion of the negative charge will be the most stable.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Warning: - The following explanation provides the most basic reasoning that sprouts from the actual discussion on resonance hybrid. It will be beneficial for those who study their textbooks.&lt;/I&gt;

* Phenoxide - draw the resonance structures and see, the negative charge is dispersed on the two ortho positions, the para position and the oxygen atom.
* Phenoxide with methyl on para position - Draw the resonance structure with negative charge on para position. The negative charge is on the carboon bonded to the methyl group, which is an electron donating group. This canonical structure is destabilized compared to the unsubstituted structure. So, its contribution is less towards the resonance hybrid, meaning that the resonance hybrid has less charge dispersion. 2&lt;1 (acidity)
* m-nitrophenoxide - See below
* p-nitrophenoxide - In the resonance structure with negative charge para to oxygen, the nitro group withdraws the electron density (how? That's another resonance structure! -m effect), thus stabilizing that particular resonance structure. Contrast this with (2) and you'll realize that (4)&gt;(1)&gt;(2)
* m-nitrophenoxide - There is no resonance structure with the negative charge on the meta position, so NO2 cannot withdraw electron density through -m effect. But then, -I effect due to its electronegativity still operates, and stabilizes it more than the phenoxide ion, although weakly.

So, the answer is &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;(4)&gt;(3)&gt;(1)&gt;(2)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
=== Cannizarro reaction ===
Factual - it is the hydride ion transfer. Note carefully that a hydride ion is transferred and not a proton!

&lt;I&gt;NCERT behaved very strangely and eliminated the mechanisms of Cannizarro and Aldol Condensation reactions and much more from it's course. Remember that Organic Chemistry is the only subject whose syllabus for AIEEE/JEE demands greater detail than the CBSE syllabi. Infact, studying organic chem on the surface has made it dull and rote-based for the normal student!&lt;/I&gt;

The mechanism of the cannizarro reaction is: -
* Nucleophillic addition of the hydroxide ion on the carbonyl carbon.
* The anion becomes an -ate anion by eliminating a hydride ion and the acidic H.
* The hydride ion acts as a nucleophile for addition over some other carbonyl carbon, creating an alcohol.

==== From wikipedia ====
=== Hoffmann isocyanide test ===
Well, that says it. This is a direct question! ...Direct question even by board exam standards! However, since they demand a structure, you need to provide the location of bonds et-al. This is the only hurdle, but is not a big challenge if you have drawn the resonance structures of the cyanide ion some times.

==== From wikipedia ====
== Question 4 ==
=== On HCP ===
=== Resonance Energy ===
== Question 5 - On Ions ==
=== Cell potential ===
&lt;I&gt;Now THIS, is a very very interesting problem! Simple to the end but very intriguing for the untrained mind!&lt;/I&gt;

There are quite a few problems relating the solubility of a salt with some cell potential. Out of experience I can say that those problems do not have a good reputation! So, what happens when you see a similar one in an examination like the JEE? Loss of confidence, what else! Keep cool! Tough questions at the JEE are all about common sense. Let's see why.

We have been given the standard cell potential of the Cu2+/Cu redox couple and we are to find its cell potential at pH 14. We keep one fact in mind that cell potentials depend upon the concentration of reactants as given in the Nernst equation. But then, what has a 1 Molar concentration of hydroxide ions got to do with the concentration of cupric ions? EVERYTHING! Cupric hydroxide is a precipitate and the Q value of its precipitation cannot exceed its k&lt;sub&gt;SP&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, cupric and hydroxide ions are in equilibrium with the precipitate of cupric hydroxide.

At equilibrium, from the k&lt;sub&gt;SP&lt;/sub&gt; of cupric hydroxide, we get the concentration of cupric ions at pH14 to be 10&lt;sup&gt;(-19)&lt;/sup&gt; M. Plug this value in the Nernst equation and get your answer. Some calculation is required, so you are not home yet, but still, you can celebrate the gain of 3 marks which not everybody would have been able to fetch in examination conditions!

The only point to be kept in mind is that the number of electrons involved in this redox half cell is 2, so n=2 in the Nernst equation. The rest is just calculation.

The answer is &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;-0.22 V&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
==== A little doubt ====
Now this is a doubt on my part. Any student or teacher who has the answer is very much welcome to answer it here!

The question has asked us to find the cell potential at pH 14. Now we used the pH 14 data to come to the conclusion that the concentration of cupric ions is 10&lt;sup&gt;(-19)&lt;/sup&gt;. If we give it a thought, the concentration can be anything less than this particular value then why did we carry on solving the problem with that particular value? Is it some assumption regarding cell potential that requires saturated solution? Or is it something much more trivial?
=== On Salt hydrolysis ===
This one is a direct question again. Make sure that you get it right anytime you do it!

Let h be the degree of hydrolysis and C be the concentration. Set up a reaction table,

* The equilibrium constant would then be &lt;math&gt;\frac{Ch^2}{1-h}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equal to the Kb of the cyanide ions, that is 10&lt;sup&gt;(-4.7)&lt;/sup&gt;. Remember that the sodium ions are spectator ions in the hydrolysis. Oh sorry, do I have to mention that cyanide ions will be in equilibrium with HCN, creating hydroxide ions? (I also apologize for any arrogant text! That just happens to be my native writing style!)

Look at the equation carefully. The denominator cannot be grater than one, so if the fraction as of the order 1/100000, it is only because degree of hydrolysis of cyanide ions itself is very small. That is to say, h&lt;&lt;1, or 1-h is approx 1.

We carry on with Ch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=\sqrt \frac{K_b}{C} ch=\sqrt CK_b &lt;/math&gt;

The expression Ch is nothing but the concentration of hydroxide ions in water.

Just take the logarithms of the equation. We get
&lt;math&gt;–pOH=\frac{\log C}{2}\frac{\log K_b}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Giving due respect to the signs of pKb and logKb, we get pOH = 2.5, &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;pH = 11.5&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

==== Let us laugh a little ====
The general trend in such questions is to specify the pKa of the conjugate acid, hydrocyanic acid in this case. Most people are then trained to carrying on the question through K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values – using K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

So when I came across an anonymous (and published) solution of this question by a JEE tutor, I was not surprised that he had elongated this simple problem by four more steps in giving the relations between pKa, pKb and pKw.

&lt;math&gt; h=\sqrt \frac{K_w}{CK_a}&lt;/math&gt;

Then after the logarithm steps, he replaced pKa wih 14 – pKb (and using about three lines to explain this). It would take very subtle observation to realize he was spinning round in circles.
==== Disclaimer ====
I mention it clearly that the above section was not written with immodest intentions or under a superiority complex. It is just a modest way to make people realize that even JEE specific classes do not guarantee quality education. Very few are competent enough and even fewer stick to the basics while nurturing open thought. BCPL, Kota is one of the best in this regard. Please keep in mind that this is just a personal opinion! 

== Question 6 - Chemical Bonding ==
=== Peroxy disulphuric acid ===
=== Alkali Earth Metal Carbonates ===
Stability of these carbonates increases as the size of the AE Metal increases. So, &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;IV &lt; II &lt; III &lt; I&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. Many sources serves this statement as a fact, however I could not explain this on the basis of Fajan’s rule or otherwise. You are welcome to edit it here on wikibooks if you can provide a legitimate explanation.
=== Structure of molecules ===
* NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - Same as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a tetrahedron with one vertex occupied by a lone pair so that the overall molecule appears pyramidal.
* Nitrate ion – The central atom is nitrogen in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid state. One oxygen is bonded through one σ and one π bond; the second one with a co-ordinate bond and the last one has a negative charge on it and is bonded by one σ bond.
* BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - Of course sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid with trigonal planar structure!
* Hydronium ion - Three bond pairs and a lone pair, makes it the same as Ammonia. That is, sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid with pyramidal shape. Actually, water has two lone pairs. But when a hydronium ion is formed from it, one lone pair of oxygen is shared with the 1S orbital of a proton making it the third bond pair.
* Hydrazoic acid – Might give you the illusion of ammonia like structure – but however can one think of a sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid hydrogen? Consider the structure below. One might want to refer the structure of the tri-iodide ion at the moment as well!

The answer is &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;C&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.

==== Note ====
Note carefully that the molecules all look similar to the untrained student! And it is not an exaggeration to say that even sincere 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; students will not be able to tell the difference between these similar molecules! Hybridization’s theory is one thing and practicing it over a lot of molecules is another! I mention this here solely to emphasize that practice is the key! Most people make the mistake of reading the same text again and again. Why don’t read it once and then solve all the problems at the end of the chapter? Alternately, why not grab some question papers and search for questions from the particular topic? I devote a lot of space in this book just to emphasize that practice allows a student to take decisions at a much better speed! DECISION MAKING allows a student to solve questions at a better speed and also to avoid conflicting thoughts while attempting questions!

=== Calcium Carbide ===
On hydrolysis, CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives ethyne. This is enough to tell that the anionic part of calcium carbide is the same as ethyne minus two protons. The answer is then &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;B&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
=== Cesium Tribromide ===
Alkali metals having a trivalent cation is an unheard statement for me. Tribromide ion is a possibility because we know I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion does exist. We just discussed its structure above. &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;B&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== Q7 - Organic Chemistry ==
== Q8 - Inorganic Chemistry ==
=== Dipole moments ===
Benzene is a non polar molecule, because the vector sum of all of the bond dipoles in the molecule is zero. When one of the hydrogen is replaced by a methyl group, the resultant dipole moment is equivalent to a single C-H dipole moment in a methane molecule. Use your existing knowledge of vectors to come to this conclusion.

In p-dichlorobenzene all bond moments add up to zero. In o-dichlorobenzene, only two bond moments of antiparallel C-H bonds cancels.  The resultant is a little less than vector sum of two C-Cl bond dipoles at 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. [Why? Don’t forget the C-H bonds antiparallel to the C-Cl bonds!] Similarly, in m-dichlorobenzene the resultant dipole moment is a little less than two C-Cl bond dipoles placed at 120&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

So, Toluene&gt;Benzene. In other words, toluene&gt;p-dichlorobenene. o-dichlorobenzene&gt;m-dichlorobenzene. Amongst the meta isomer and toluene, the meta isomer has a higher dipole moment. [Why?]

&lt;B&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;B&gt;OMDM&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
=== Catalytic hydrogenation ===
== Q10 – Objectives again ==
=== Electrolysis ===
Obtaining sodium out of the electrolysis of any aqueous sodium salt is out of the question? Why would the Hall Heroultz process be important if it was so easy to obtain sodium? S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is the reduction product of sulphate ions – so we cant obtain it at the anode. &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;A&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the answer then!

Note: - We require a better answer over here! Editors, please!

=== Effusion ===
Stick to the basics! We’ll simply use the fact that the ratio of rates of effusion of two gases is proportional to the square root of the inverse ratio of molar masses!

&lt;math&gt;r_\left (H_2 \right) = \frac{Volume X}{Time taken}= \frac{X}{5 sec}&lt;/math&gt;

We’ll write relative rates of effusion as ratio of X/(Time taken by gas) and equate it with that given by graham’s law.

So for example, checking it with Oxygen,&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{X}{T_H_2}}{\frac{X}{T_O_2}}=\sqrt\frac{M_O_2}{M_H_2}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us T&lt;sub&gt;O2&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 seconds, which is correct. &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;Answer is B&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. This was just an example, the QP expects you to verify all options before arriving to the correct one.

==Useful Data==

===Question 1===
'''(i)''' A mixture of ideal gases is cooled upto liquid helium temperature (4.22 K) to form an ideal solution. Is this statement true or false ? Justifiy your answer in not more than two lines. 
&lt;P&gt;
'''(ii)''' Calculate the wave number for the shortest wavelength transition in the Balmer series of atomic hydrogen. 
&lt;P&gt;
'''(iii)''' The rate constant, the activation energy and the Arrhenius parameter of a chemical reaction at 25󿼇C are 3.0x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 104.4 kJ mo1&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 6.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;s &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. The value of the rate constant as T → &amp;infin is:
:(a)2.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;s &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:(b)6.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;s &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:(c)Infinity
:(d)3.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;s &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;P&gt;

'''(iv)''' The orbital angular momentum of an electron in 2s orbital is:
:(a)&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:(b)&lt;math&gt;\frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:(c)Zero
:(d)&lt;math&gt;\sqrt2\frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

===Question 2===
''5 marks''
A 3.0 g sample containing Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and an inert impure substance, is treated with excess of KI solution in presence of dilute H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The entire iron is converted into Fe&lt;Sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; along with the liberation of iodine. The resulting solution is diluted to 100 mL. A 20 mL of the diluted solution requires 11.0 mL of 0.5 M Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solution to reduce the iodine present. A 50 mL of the diluted solution, after complete extraction of the iodine required' 12.80 mL of 0.25 M KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solution in dilute H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; medium for the oxidation of Fe&lt;Sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Question 3===
What is your name?

===Question 4===
'''(i)''' A metallic element crystallises into a lattice containing a sequence of layers of ABABAB ......... Any packing of spheres leaves out voids in the lattice. What percentage by volume of this lattice is empty space?
'''(ii)''' The standard molar enthalpies of formation of cyclohexane (1) and benezene (1) at 25󿼇C are -156 and + 49 kJ mol -! respectively. The standard enthallW of hydrogenation of cyc. lohexene (1) at 25󿼇C is-119 kJ tool -1 . Use these data to estimate the magnitude of the resonance energy of benzene.

Due to their low usage, they are not a major target for hackers &amp; theoretically as secure as windows vista or linux (seperation of root, via prompts) '''[this is factual and should be included in the article]'''. The actual security depends on the quality of code, ( this could be argued about for ever, as it has open source code which is more visibile etc) and '''should not be in the article''', '''except''' for mentions of direct testing against its competition (like the competition mac recently lost), but even if this is mentioned it should be mentioned that there are few in the wild viruses for mac, mainly due to small user base.</text>

I plan on writing some extended plot summaries for ''[http://www.vomitgirl.org/ The Divine Comedy]'' (WP link [[:w:en:The Divine Comedy|here]]) and ''[http://www.vomitgirl.org/ The Faerie Queene]'' (WP link [[:w:en:The Faerie Queene|here]]), and possibly other works, as a supplement to what I already do at Wikipedia. This will take some time, of course, and it's more of a long-term goal. — [[User talk:Kyoko|&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot; color=&quot;#8652b9&quot;&gt;''Kyok''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Kyoko|&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot; color=&quot;#BA55D3&quot;&gt;''o''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/div&gt;</text>

This is a new book, but the author has already indicated that he has no intention on contributing any further than the bare stub that it is. As such, I feel that this book is a violation of [[WB:HOST|not a free host]], as it currently does little more than point people to Wikipedia and a FAQ on another website.

*{{del}} Pidgin is a good open-source software project that would be worthy of having a book here to teach people how to use it. However, this particular attempt at a book isn't viable.

This appears to be simply a list of [[w:Eugene Fama|Eugene Fama]]'s works. It has been tagged for transwiki to Wikisource, but it is questionable whether it fits within their inclusion policy. I don't think it fits within ours.

: '''Concluding note''': the original author (retired from academic life) in fact moved this to Wikiversity about 18 months ago and continued working on it for about six months, transferring materials from his own site. There seems to have been a rather sad history of him moving the project from one host to another, and having hosters retrospectively change permissions on the material. Unfortunately [[User:JWSchmidt]] tagged the pages as a copyright violation, following which the author protested and left with the project incomplete. All rather sad. However Wikibooks can go ahead and delete its copy of this. Wikiversity will keep what he left us with. --[[User:McCormack|McCormack]] ([[User talk:McCormack|talk]]) 15:42, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

There's really nothing here, except a bunch of redlinks, and two subpages, one of which I have moved into another book. Also, it survived a previous VFD [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Study Guide:US History and Study Guide:British colonies in the New World|here]].

* {{del}} This book is almost 4 years old!  It was nominated before for deletion for reasons that there already exists a US History book (it's a featured book).  Although this book has a few blue links they have no worthwhile content and only intend to give an overview (which hasn't been completed anyway) which suggests that it's not a book but questions about an existing book or course.  As no progress has been made on this book in about 1400 days I think it's time it was deleted. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:53, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
This page outlines some more advanced uses of mathematics markup using LaTeX. In particular it makes heavy use of the AMS-LaTeX packages supplied by the [[w:American Mathematical Society|American Mathematical Society]].

== Equation numbering ==
The &lt;code&gt;equation&lt;/code&gt; environment automatically numbers your equation:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\begin{equation} 
 f(x)=(x+a)(x+b)
\end{equation}
|render=&lt;math&gt; {f(x)}=(x+a)(x+b) {\color{White} ww} (1) \, &lt;/math&gt;}}

You can also use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\label}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ref}} (or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\eqref}} from the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package) commands to label and reference equations, respectively. For equation number 1, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ref}} results in &lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt; and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\eqref}} results in &lt;math&gt;(1)\,&lt;/math&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation} \label{eq:someequation}
5^2 - 5 = 20
\end{equation}

this references the equation \ref{eq:someequation}.
|render=&lt;math&gt;5^2 - 5 = 20\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{this references equation 1.}\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation} \label{eq:erl}
a = bq + r
\end{equation}

where \eqref{eq:erl} is true if $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b \neq c$.
|render=&lt;math&gt;a = bq + r\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{where (1) is true if }a\text{ and }b\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{are integers with }b \neq c.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Further information is provided in the [[LaTeX/Labels and Cross-referencing|labels and cross-referencing]] chapter.

To have the enumeration follow from your section or subsection heading, you must use the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package or use AMS class documents. 
Then enter 
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\numberwithin{equation}{section}
}}
to the preamble to get enumeration at the section level or
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\numberwithin{equation}{subsection}
}}
to have the enumeration go to the subsection level.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
 \numberwithin{equation}{subsection}
 \begin{document}
 \section{First Section}

 \subsection{A subsection}
 \begin{equation}
  L' = {L}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}&lt;!-- --&gt;}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
 \end{equation}
\end{document}
|render=
&lt;math&gt; L' = {L}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } } {\color{White} ww} (1.1.1) \, &lt;/math&gt;}}

If the style you follow requires putting dots after ordinals (as it is required at least in Polish typography) the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\numberwithin{equation}{subsection} }} command in the preamble will result in the equation number in the above example to be rendered in this way: (1.1..1).

To remove the duplicate dot, add the following command immediately after
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\numberwithin{equation}{section} }}:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\renewcommand{\theequation}{\thesection\arabic{equation}&lt;!-- --&gt;} }}

For a numbering scheme using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\numberwithin{equation}{subsection} }}, use:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\renewcommand{\theequation}{\thesubsection\arabic{equation}&lt;!-- --&gt;} }}
in the preamble of the document.

Note: Though it may look like the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewcommand}} works by itself, it won't reset the equation number with each new section. It must be used together with manual equation number resetting after each new section beginning or with the much cleaner {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\numberwithin}}.

=== Subordinate equation numbering ===
To number subordinate equations in a numbered equation environment, place the part of document containing them in a {{LaTeX/Environment|subequations}} environment:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\begin{subequations}
Maxwell's equations:
\begin{align}
        B'&amp;=-\nabla \times E,\\
        E'&amp;=\nabla \times B - 4\pi j,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\text{Maxwell}'\text{s equations:}\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
        B'&amp;=-\nabla \times E, &amp;\quad&amp;\mathrm{(1.1a)}\\
        E'&amp;=\nabla \times B - 4\pi j, &amp;&amp;\mathrm{(1.1b)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Referencing subordinate equations can be done using either of two methods: adding a label after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{subequations} }} command, which will reference the main equation (1.1 above),  or adding a label at the end of each line, before the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}} command, which will reference the sub-equation (1.1a or 1.1b above). It is possible to add both labels in case both types of references are needed.

== Vertically aligning displayed mathematics ==
An often encountered problem with displayed environments ({{LaTeX/Environment|displaymath}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|equation}}) is the lack of any ability to span multiple lines. While it is possible to define lines individually, these will not be aligned.

=== Above and below ===
The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\overset}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underset}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;  typeset symbols above and below expressions. 
Without AmsTex the same result of  {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\overset}}  can be obtained with  {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\stackrel}}.
This can be particularly useful for creating new binary relations:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 A \overset{!}{=} B; A \stackrel{!}{=} B
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 A \overset{!}{=} B;~~
 A \stackrel{!}{=} B
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
or to show usage of [[Wikipedia:L'Hôpital's_rule|L'Hôpital's rule]]:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x-1}{2x}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
 \overset{\left[\frac{0}{0}\right]}{\underset{\mathrm{H}&lt;!-- --&gt;}{=}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x}{2}&lt;!-- --&gt;}={\frac{1}{2}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x-1}{2x} }
 \overset{\left[\frac{0}{0}\right]}{\underset{\mathrm{H} }{=} }
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x}{2} }={\frac{1}{2} }
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is convenient to define a new operator that will set the equal sign with H and the provided fraction:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\Heq}[1]{\overset{\left[#1\right]}{\underset{\mathrm{H}&lt;!-- --&gt;}{=}&lt;!-- --&gt;}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
}}
which reduces the above example to:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\[
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x-1}{2x}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
 \Heq{\frac{0}{0}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
 \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x}{2}&lt;!-- --&gt;}={\frac{1}{2}&lt;!-- --&gt;}
\]
}}

If the purpose is to make comments on particular parts of an equation, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\overbrace}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underbrace}} commands may be more useful. However, they have a different syntax (and can be aligned with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vphantom}} command):
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 z = \overbrace{
   \underbrace{x}_\text{real} + i
   \underbrace{y}_\text{imaginary}
  }^\text{complex number}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 z = \overbrace{
   \underbrace{x}_\text{real} + i
   \underbrace{y}_\text{imaginary}
  }^\text{complex number}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

Sometimes the comments are longer than the formula being commented on, which can cause spacing problems. These can be removed using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathclap}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 y = a + f(\underbrace{b x}_{
                    \ge 0 \text{ by assumption}&lt;!-- --&gt;}) 
   = a + f(\underbrace{b x}_{
          \mathclap{\ge 0 \text{ by assumption}&lt;!-- --&gt;}&lt;!-- --&gt;})
\]
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX-mathclap-example.png|350px]]
}}

Alternatively, to use brackets instead of braces use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underbracket}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\overbracket}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;&gt;requires the {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 z = \overbracket[3pt]{
     \underbracket{x}_{\text{real}&lt;!----&gt;} +
     \underbracket[0.5pt][7pt]{iy}_{\text{imaginary}&lt;!----&gt;}
     }^{\text{complex number}&lt;!----&gt;} 
\]
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-mathtools-brackets.png|170px]]}}

The optional arguments set the rule thickness and bracket height respectively:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\underbracket[rule thickness][bracket height]{argument}_{text below}
}}

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\xleftarrow}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\xrightarrow}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; produce arrows which extend to the length of the text. Yet again, the syntax is different: the optional argument (using &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;) specifies the subscript, and the mandatory argument (using &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) specifies the superscript (which can be left empty by inserting a blank space).
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 A \xleftarrow{\text{this way}&lt;!-- --&gt;} B 
  \xrightarrow[\text{or that way}]{ } C
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
A \xleftarrow{\text{this way}} B \xrightarrow[\text{or that way}]{} C
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

For more extensible arrows, you must use {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 a \xleftrightarrow[under]{over} b\\
%
 A \xLeftarrow[under]{over} B\\
%
 B \xRightarrow[under]{over} C\\
%
 C \xLeftrightarrow[under]{over} D\\
%
 D \xhookleftarrow[under]{over} E\\
%
 E \xhookrightarrow[under]{over} F\\
%
 F \xmapsto[under]{over} G\\
\]
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-mathtools-arrows.png|90px]]}}

and for harpoons:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 H \xrightharpoondown[under]{over} I\\
%
 I \xrightharpoonup[under]{over} J\\
%
 J \xleftharpoondown[under]{over} K\\
%
 K \xleftharpoonup[under]{over} L\\
%
 L \xrightleftharpoons[under]{over} M\\
%
 M \xleftrightharpoons[under]{over} N
\]
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-mathtools-harpoons.png|90px]]}}

=== {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}} ===
The {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}} environments, available through the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package, are used for arranging equations of multiple lines. As with matrices and tables, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}} specifies a line break, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&amp;}} is used to indicate the point at which the lines should be aligned.

The {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}} environment is used like the {{LaTeX/Environment|displaymath}} or {{LaTeX/Environment|equation*}} environment:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align*}
 f(x) &amp;= (x+a)(x+b) \\
 &amp;= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
\end{align*}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= (x+a)(x+b) \\
&amp;= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
\end{align}\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Note that the {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} environment must not be nested inside an {{LaTeX/Environment|equation}} (or similar) environment.  Instead, {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} is a replacement for such environments; the contents inside an {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} are automatically placed in math mode.

{{LaTeX/Environment|align*}} suppresses numbering.  To force numbering on a specific line, use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tag{...}&lt;!-- --&gt;}} command before the linebreak.

{{LaTeX/Environment|align}} is similar, but automatically numbers each line like the {{LaTeX/Environment|equation}} environment.  Individual lines may be referred to by placing a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\label{...}&lt;!-- --&gt;}} before the linebreak. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nonumber}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\notag}} command can be used to suppress the number for a given line:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align}
 f(x) &amp;= x^4 + 7x^3 + 2x^2 \nonumber \\
 &amp;\qquad {} + 10x + 12
\end{align}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= x^4 + 7x^3 + 2x^2 \\
&amp;\qquad {} + 10x + 12 \qquad \qquad (3)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Notice that we've added some indenting on the second line.  Also, we need to insert the double braces (&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;) before the + sign, otherwise latex won't create the correct spacing after the + sign.  The reason for this is that without the braces, latex interprets the + sign as a unary operator, instead of the binary operator that it really is.

More complicated alignments are possible. The following example illustrates the alignment rule of {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align*}
 a &amp; b &amp; c &amp; d &amp; e &amp; f &amp; g &amp; h &amp; i &amp; j
\end{align*}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 a &amp; b &amp; c &amp; d &amp; e &amp; f &amp; g &amp; h &amp; i &amp; j
\end{align}\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Braces spanning multiple lines ===
Additional {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&amp;}}'s on a single line will specify multiple &quot;equation columns&quot;, each of which is aligned. If you want a brace to continue across a new line, do the following:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align}
 f(x) &amp;= \pi \left\{ x^4 + 7x^3 + 2x^2 \right.\nonumber\\
 &amp;\qquad \left. {} + 10x + 12 \right\}
\end{align}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \pi \left\{ x^4 + 7x^3 + 2x^2 \right.\\
&amp;\qquad \left. {} + 10x + 12 \right\}  \qquad \qquad (4)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

In this construction, the sizes of the left and right braces are not automatically equal, in spite of the use of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left\{}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right\}&lt;!--
--&gt;}}. This is because each line is typeset as a completely separate equation &amp;mdash;notice the use of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right.}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left.}} so there are no unpaired {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right}} commands within a line (these aren't needed if the formula is on one line). You can control the size of the braces manually with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\big}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Big}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bigg}}, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Bigg}} commands.

Alternatively, the height of the taller equation can be replicated in the other using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vphantom}} command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align}
 A &amp;=     \left(\int_t XXX       \right.\nonumber\\
   &amp;\qquad \left.\vphantom{\int_t} YYY \dots \right)
\end{align}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 A &amp;=     \left(\int_t XXX\right.\\
   &amp;\qquad YYY \dots \biggr)\qquad\qquad \mathrm{(5)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

==== Using aligned braces for piecewise functions ====
You can also use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left\{}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right\}&lt;!--
--&gt;}} to typeset [[w:piecewise functions|piecewise functions]]:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[f(x) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    x^2 &amp; : x &lt; 0\\
    x^3 &amp; : x \ge 0
  \end{array}
\right.
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    x^2 &amp; : x &lt; 0\\
    x^3 &amp; : x \ge 0
  \end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== The {{LaTeX/Environment|cases}} environment ===
The {{LaTeX/Environment|cases}} environment&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; allows the writing of piecewise functions:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 u(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
   \exp{x} &amp; \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
   1       &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0
  \end{cases}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
u(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\exp{x} &amp; \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
1       &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
LaTeX will then take care of defining and or aligning the columns.

Within {{LaTeX/Environment|cases}}, text style math is used with results such as:

&lt;math&gt;
a =
 \begin{cases}
  \int x\, \mathrm{d} x\\
  b^2
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Display style may be used instead, by using the {{LaTeX/Environment|dcases}} environment&lt;ref name=mathtools/&gt; from {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 a =
   \begin{dcases}
     \int x\, \mathrm{d} x\\
     b^2
   \end{dcases}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
a =
 \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle\int x\, \mathrm{d} x\\
  \displaystyle b^2
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

Often the second column consists mostly of normal text, to set it in the normal roman font of the document the {{LaTeX/Environment|dcases*}} environment may be used:&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 f(x) = \begin{dcases*}
        x  &amp; when $x$ is even\\
        -x &amp; when $x$ is odd
        \end{dcases*}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 f(x) = \begin{cases}
 x  &amp; \text{when }x\text{ is even}\\
 -x &amp; \text{when }x\text{ is odd}
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Other environments ===
Although {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}} are the most useful, there are several other environments which may also be of interest:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Environment name
! Description
! Notes
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|eqnarray}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|eqnarray*}}
| Similar to {{LaTeX/Environment|align}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}}
| Not recommended because spacing is inconsistent
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|multline}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|multline*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| First line left aligned, last line right aligned
| Equation number aligned vertically with first line and not centered as with other environments
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|gather}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|gather*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Consecutive equations without alignment
| 
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|flalign}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|flalign*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Similar to {{LaTeX/Environment|align}}, but left aligns first equation column, and right aligns last column
| 
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|alignat}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|alignat*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Takes an argument specifying number of columns. Allows to control explicitly the horizontal space between equations
| You can calculate the number of columns by counting {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&amp;}} characters in  a line and adding 1
|}

There are also few environments that don't form a math environment by themselves and can be used as building blocks for more elaborate structures:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Math environment name
! Description
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|gathered}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Allows to gather few equations to be set under each other and assigned a single equation number
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|split}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Similar to {{LaTeX/Environment|align*}}, but used inside another displayed mathematics environment
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|aligned}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Similar to {{LaTeX/Environment|align}}, to be used inside another mathematics environment.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|alignedat}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| Similar to {{LaTeX/Environment|alignat}}, and just as it, takes an additional argument specifying number of columns of equations to set.
|}

For example:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
 \left.\begin{aligned}
        B'&amp;=-\partial \times E,\\
        E'&amp;=\partial \times B - 4\pi j,
       \end{aligned}
 \right\}
 \qquad \text{Maxwell's equations}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\left.\begin{align}
        B'&amp;=-\partial \times E,\\
        E'&amp;=\partial \times B - 4\pi j,
\end{align}\right\}\quad\text{Maxwell}'\text{s equations}\qquad\mathrm{(1.1)}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{alignat}{2}
 \sigma_1 &amp;= x + y  &amp;\quad \sigma_2 &amp;= \frac{x}{y} \\	
 \sigma_1' &amp;= \frac{\partial x + y}{\partial x} &amp; \sigma_2' 
    &amp;= \frac{\partial \frac{x}{y}&lt;!----&gt;}{\partial x}
\end{alignat}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \sigma_1 &amp;= x + y  &amp;\sigma_2 &amp;= \frac{x}{y}  &amp;\qquad&amp;\qquad&amp;(1)   \\	
 \sigma_1' &amp;= \frac{\partial x + y}{\partial x} &amp; \sigma_2' &amp;= \frac{\partial \frac{x}{y}}{\partial x} &amp;&amp;&amp;(2)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{gather*}
a_0=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\\[6pt]
\begin{split}
a_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\cos nx\,\mathrm{d}x=\\
=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}x^2\cos nx\,\mathrm{d}x
\end{split}\\[6pt]
\begin{split}
b_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\sin nx\,\mathrm{d}x=\\
=\frac{1}{\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}x^2\sin nx\,\mathrm{d}x
\end{split}\\[6pt]
\end{gather*}
|render=[[file:LaTeX example split gather.png|150px]]
}}

== Indented Equations ==

In order to indent an equation, you can set {{LaTeX/Parameter|fleqn}} in the document class and then specify a certain value for the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathindent}} variable:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn]{report}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\setlength{\mathindent}{1cm}
\begin{document}
\noindent Euler's formula is given below:
\begin{equation*}
 e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i \sin{x}.
\end{equation*}
\noindent This is a very important formula.
\end{document}
|render=
[[File:LaTeX - Indented Equations.png]]
}}

== Page breaks in math environments ==
To suggest LaTeX insert a page break inside an {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} environment you may use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaybreak}} command before the line break. Just like with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagebreak}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaybreak}} can take an optional argument between 0 and 4 denoting the level of desirability of a page break. While 0 means &quot;it is permissible to break here&quot;, 4 forces a break. No argument means the same as 4.

Alternatively, you may enable automatic page breaks in math environments with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\allowdisplaybreaks}}. It too can have an optional argument denoting the priority of page breaks in equations. Similarly, 1 means &quot;allow page breaks but avoid them&quot; and 4 means &quot;break whenever you want&quot;. You can prohibit a page break after a given line using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\*}}.

LaTeX will insert a page break into a long equation if it has additional text added using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\intertext{}&lt;!-- --&gt;}} without any additional commands.

Specific usage may look like this:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align*}
 &amp;\vdots\\ 
 &amp;=12+7 \int_0^2
  \left(
    -\frac{1}{4}\left(e^{-4t_1}+e^{4t_1-8}\right)
  \right)\,dt_1\displaybreak[3]\\
 &amp;= 12-\frac{7}{4}\int_0^2 \left( e^{-4t_1}+e^{4t_1-8} \right)\,dt_1\\
 &amp;\vdots % 
\end{align*}
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-displaybreak-in-math.png|400px]]
}}

== Boxed Equations ==
For a single equation or alignment building block, with the tag outside the box, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\boxed{}&lt;!-- --&gt;}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
 \boxed{x^2+y^2 = z^2}
\end{equation}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX-boxed-equation.png|250px]]
}}

If you want the entire line or several equations to be boxed, use a {{LaTeX/Environment|minipage}} inside an {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fbox{}&lt;!----&gt;}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\fbox{
 \addtolength{\linewidth}{-2\fboxsep}%
 \addtolength{\linewidth}{-2\fboxrule}%
 \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
  \begin{equation}
   x^2+y^2=z^2
  \end{equation}
 \end{minipage}
}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX-boxed-formula-minipage.png|400px]]
}}

There is also the mathtools {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Aboxed{}&lt;!-- --&gt;}} which is able to box across alignment marks:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{ f(x) &amp; = \int h(x)\, dx} \\
              &amp; = g(x)
\end{align*}
|render=[[Image:Latex-Aboxed-example.png|180px]]
}}

== Custom operators ==
Although many common [[../Mathematics#Operators|operators]] are available in LaTeX, sometimes you will need to write your own, e.g. to typeset the [[w:Arg max|argmax]] operator. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\operatorname}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\operatorname*}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;&gt;Requires {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package&lt;/ref&gt; display custom operators; the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; version sets the underscored option underneath like the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\lim}} operator:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \operatorname{arg\,max}_a f(a) 
 = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_b f(b)
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max}_a f(a) = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_b f(b)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

However, if the operator is frequently used, it is preferable to define a new operator that can be used throughout the entire document. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DeclareMathOperator}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DeclareMathOperator*}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; are specified in the header of the document:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{arg\,max}&lt;!----&gt;
}}
This defines a new command which may be referred to in the body:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \argmax_c f(c)
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\underset{c}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} f(c)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Advanced formatting ==
=== Limits ===
There are defaults for placement of subscripts and superscripts e.g. limits for the &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt; operator are usually placed below the symbol:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{a\to \infty} \tfrac{1}{a}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to \infty} \tfrac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To override this behavior, use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nolimits}} operator:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \lim\nolimits_{a\to \infty} \tfrac{1}{a}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\lim\nolimits_{a\to \infty} \tfrac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

A &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt; in running text (inside {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$...$}}) will have its limits placed on the side, so that additional leading won't be required. To override this behavior, use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\limits}} command.

Similarly one can put subscripts under a symbol that usually have them on the side:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \int_a^b x^2  \mathrm{d} x
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b x^2  \mathrm{d} x&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Limits below and under:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \int\limits_a^b x^2  \mathrm{d} x
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_a^b x^2  \mathrm{d} x&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To change the default placement of summation-type symbols to the side for every case, add the {{LaTeX/Parameter|nosumlimits}} option to the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package. To change the placement for integral symbols, add {{LaTeX/Parameter|intlimits}} to the options. {{LaTeX/Parameter|nonamelimits}} can be used to change the default for named operators like &lt;tt&gt;det&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;min&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.

To produce one-sided limits, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underset}} as follows:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{a \underset{&gt;}{\to} 0} \frac{1}{a}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a \underset{&gt;}{\to} 0} \frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Subscripts and superscripts ===

While you can place symbols in subscript or superscript (in summation style symbols) with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nolimits}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \sum\nolimits' C_n
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits' C_n&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It's impossible to mix them with typical usage of such symbols:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}\nolimits' C_n
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}\nolimits' C_n&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To add both prime and a limit to a symbol, one has to use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sideset}} command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=1}C_n
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=1}C_n&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is very flexible: for example, to put letters in each corner of the symbol use this command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \sideset{_a^b}{_c^d}\sum
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\sideset{_a^b}{_c^d}\sum&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you wish to place them on the corners of an arbitrary symbol, you should use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fourIdx}} from the {{LaTeX/Package|fouridx}} package.

=== Multiline subscripts ===
To produce multiline subscript use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\substack}} command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  \prod_{\substack{
            1\le i \le n\\
            1\le j \le m}&lt;!----&gt;}
     M_{i,j}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\prod_{1 \le i \le n \atop 1 \le j \le m \ } M_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Text in aligned math display ==
To add small interjections in math environments use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\intertext}} command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{minipage}{3in}
\begin{align*}
\intertext{If}
   A &amp;= \sigma_1+\sigma_2\\
   B &amp;= \rho_1+\rho_2\\
\intertext{then}
C(x) &amp;= e^{Ax^2+\pi}+B
\end{align*} 
\end{minipage}
|render=
[[Image:Latex-intertext.png|250px]]
}}
Note that any usage of this command does not change the alignment.

Also, in the above example, the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\shortintertext{} }} from the {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package could have been used instead of intertext to reduce the amount of vertical whitespace added between the lines.

== Changing font size ==

There may be a time when you would prefer to have some control over the size. For example, using text-mode maths, by default a simple fraction will look like this: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, whereas you may prefer to have it displayed larger, like when in display mode, but still keeping it in-line, like this: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{a}{b} &lt;/math&gt;.

A simple approach is to utilize the predefined sizes for maths elements:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Size command
! Description
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}}
| Size for equations in display mode
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textstyle}}
| Size for equations in text mode
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\scriptstyle}}
| Size for first sub/superscripts
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\scriptscriptstyle}}
| Size for subsequent sub/superscripts
|}

A classic example to see this in use is typesetting continued fractions (though it's better to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cfrac}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; described in the [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Continued_fractions|Mathematics]] chapter over the method provided below). The following code provides an example.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

As you can see, as the fractions continue, they get smaller (although they will not get any smaller as in this example, they have reached the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\scriptstyle}} limit). If you wanted to keep the size consistent, you could declare each fraction to use the display style instead, e.g.:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  x = a_0 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_1 
          + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_2 
          + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_3 + a_4}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;   x = a_0 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_1 
           + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_2 
           + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_3 + a_4}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Another approach is to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DeclareMathSizes}} command to select your preferred sizes. You can only define sizes for {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textstyle}}, etc. One potential downside is that this command sets the global maths sizes, as it can only be used in the document preamble.

However, it's fairly easy to use: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DeclareMathSizes{ds}{ts}{ss}{sss}&lt;!----&gt;}}, where ''ds'' is the ''display size'', ''ts'' is the ''text size'', etc. The values you input are assumed to be point (pt) size.

NB the changes only take place if the value in the first argument matches the current document text size. It is therefore common to see a set of declarations in the preamble, in the event of the main font being changed. E.g.,
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\DeclareMathSizes{10}{18}{12}{8}   % For size 10 text
\DeclareMathSizes{11}{19}{13}{9}   % For size 11 text
\DeclareMathSizes{12}{20}{14}{10}  % For size 12 text
}}

== Forcing \displaystyle for all math in a document ==
Put
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\everymath{\displaystyle}
}}
before {{LaTeX/Usage|code= \begin{document} }} to force all math to {{LaTeX/Usage|code= \displaystyle }}.

== Adjusting vertical whitespace around displayed math ==
There are four parameters which control the vertical whitespace around displayed math:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\abovedisplayskip=12pt
\belowdisplayskip=12pt
\abovedisplayshortskip=0pt
\belowdisplayshortskip=7pt
}}
Short skips are used if the preceding line ends, horizontally, before the formula. These parameters must be set after {{LaTeX/Usage|code= \begin{document} }}.

'''Buttermilk Biscuits''' are a variety of [[Cookbook:Biscuits|biscuits]] using cultured buttermilk as the primary liquid.  Other biscuits use milk, or a combination of milk and cream, or powdered milk and water as the liquid.  Since buttermilk is an acidic ingredient, typically an increased amount of baking soda is used, and baking powder is reduced or eliminated.  This recipe is for one variety of Southern-style (U.S.) hand-rolled biscuits, which are formed in the hands as opposed to being rolled and cut, but the shaping style is optional.  These biscuits are incredibly light and fluffy.

==Ingredients==

* 2c [[Cookbook:Flour|Self-raising flour]], sifted, preferably low-protein biscuit flour
* 1/4t [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1/4t [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1T [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (optional)
* 1/3c [[Cookbook:shortening|shortening]]
* 1c plus 2T cultured [[Cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* 1/2c [[Cookbook:Flour|All-purpose flour]]
* 1/4c [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], melted (optional)

Makes 12 biscuits (2 inch diameter before baking, 2.5-3 inch diameter after baking.)

==Preparation==
# Move oven rack to highest position, and pre-heat to 450 degrees F.
# Grease the bottom of a biscuit or cookie sheet with a shortening or butter.
# Mix sifted flour, soda, salt, and sugar (if using) in a medium or large bowl.
# Using a pastry blender or fork, cut in shortening until evenly distributed, with no flakes of shortening bigger than a green pea remaining.  It will look like cornmeal, only coarser.
# Using a large spoon, fold in 1/2 c buttermilk, then another 1/2 c to moisten the flour evenly.  Stir only long enough to moisten the mixture sufficiently.  If flour remains after a few stirs, add the remaining 2T buttermilk.
# Let mixture rest and rise 3-5 minutes. The mixture should be quite moist, but not pourable. If the mixture seems dry, add more buttermilk.
# Shape biscuits by hand using the method described in the Notes.
# Place on greased biscuit sheet with sides touching
# Delicately brush generously with melted butter.
# Bake for 12-16 minutes, depending on the biscuit size, until tops and bottoms are nicely browned.
# Serve immediately with softened butter. See Notes for additional ideas.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* To hand-roll biscuits: 
- Pour one half cup all-purpose flour in a plate.  
- Assuming you are right-handed, grab a teaspoon or so of the all-purpose flour in your left hand, and make sure your inner palm is mostly covered.  
- With your right hand, using a soup spoon, scoop about about 3 T of the biscuit mixture in your left hand.
- Working over the flour plate, Grab some flour with your right hand and sprinkle on top of the scoop of biscuit mixture.  (The wet mixture will not stick to your hands if enough flour is used.) 
- Begin gently tossing the biscuit back and forth between your floured hands until the outside of the biscuit is coated lightly with flour. The excess flour will fall off your hands back into the plate.
- Gently shape the dough into a fairly smooth ball, place on biscuit sheet with sides touching, and press to flatten slightly - about 1&quot; high. Grab a little more flour and continue with the next biscuit.

* If your hands become sticky when rolling biscuits, wash and dry your hands and use more flour.
* If the dough isn't moist enough to stick to your unfloured hands, the mixture isn't moist enough for this style of biscuit.  The biscuits will taste fine, but will not be as fluffy.
* Use all-purpose flour for rolling to avoid tasting chemicals from self-rising flour. Those chemicals would not have been sufficiently moistened on the outside of a biscuit.
* If cultured buttermilk is not available, similar results can be obtained by mixing 2T lemon juice with enough milk to make a cup, and letting stand 10 minutes.
* Biscuits do not need to be kneaded.  In fact, if you knead the biscuits, you will likely incorporate too much flour to get a high, fluffy biscuit.
* Lard or butter may be used instead of shortening.
* If self-rising flour is not available, substitute all-purpose flour and add baking powder and salt.  An alternative is to add baking soda and cream of tarter.  If desired, use only baking soda as leavening.  This is acceptable since the buttermilk is acidic.
* The preferred flour is Southern &quot;biscuit&quot; flour, a soft wheat flour with a protein content of 2g per 1/4 cup.  Non-Southern flours, at 3g protein per 1/4 cup, are acceptable.
* Low protein flours require less buttermilk than higher protein flours.  You will have to adjust the liquid in the recipe according to the protein content of the flour, the type of fat used (butter is part liquid), the humidity of the flour, and the desired texture of the final biscuit.  In general, the mixture you roll should be quite moist, but not pourable.  
* Do not skip the resting step, as the flour needs a brief period to accept the moisture.
* The sugar and salt may be dissolved into the buttermilk if desired.  The sugar may be omitted altogether.
* Cream may be substituted for 1/4c of the buttermilk.
* For a traditional Southern topping, mix equal parts softened butter and molasses.
* Butter biscuits immediately so the butter melts.  Always used softened or melted butter as refrigerated butter is too hard and will tear the biscuit.  Softened butter is best.
* If you are unsure if a biscuit is done, use an instant read thermometer and remove when internal temperature reaches 205-210 degrees F.
* If using a convection oven with the fan on, the oven rack may be in the center position.

== Other mixing / shaping methods ==
* Some cooks prefer this method of mixing:
- Mix dry ingredients and place in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center.
- Put all the shortening in the center of the flour.
- Add 3/4 c buttermilk, and using one hand, cream the buttermilk and shortening until mostly smooth.
- Gradually pull in flour from the sides, until the appropriate the flour has been incorporated.
- Add more buttermilk and flour as needed.
- Shape by hand or roll out on floured surface and cut with biscuit cutter, dipping cutter in all-purpose flour when cutting each biscuit.

* Thin biscuits can be made with the same recipe, except you will use less buttermilk and roll out to 1/2&quot; on a floured board.  Cut with a floured biscuit cutter.

* To save time, using a spatula, spread out all the biscuit mixture onto the pan, and with floured hands, pat the &quot;cake&quot; to an even 1&quot; height.  Bake as usual.

* Instead of brushing the butter on the biscuits before baking, you can pour the butter slowly over each biscuit, letting the excess drip between the biscuits.  Use your fingers to evenly coat each biscuit top with butter.

==Warnings==

* Biscuits are best consumed immediately.  However, left-over biscuits can be heated or toasted.  Buttering immediately helps for a better-tasting left-over biscuit.
* Do not use bread flour (protein content 4g per 1/4 cup) as the biscuits will not be light and fluffy.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

LaTeX can be used for creating presentations. There are several packages for the task, including the &lt;tt&gt;beamer&lt;/tt&gt; package.

== The Beamer package ==

The beamer package is provided with most LaTeX distributions, but is also available from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/ CTAN]. If you use MikTeX, all you have to do is to include the beamer package and let LaTeX download all wanted packages automatically. The [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf documentation] explains the features in great detail. You can also have a look at the PracTex article '''Beamer by example'''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Mertz and William Slough ''Beamer by Example''&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;beamer&lt;/tt&gt; package also loads many useful packages including &lt;tt&gt;hyperref&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Introductory example ===

The beamer package is loaded by calling the &lt;tt&gt;beamer&lt;/tt&gt; class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass{beamer}
&lt;/source&gt;

The usual header information may then be specified. Note that if you are compiling with XeTeX then you should use

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[xetex,mathserif,serif]{beamer}
&lt;/source&gt;

Inside the usual &lt;tt&gt;document&lt;/tt&gt; environment, multiple &lt;tt&gt;frame&lt;/tt&gt; environments specify the content to be put on each slide. The &lt;tt&gt;frametitle&lt;/tt&gt; command specifies the title for each slide (see image):

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{document}
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{This is the first slide}
    %Content goes here
  \end{frame}
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{This is the second slide}
    \framesubtitle{A bit more information about this}
    %More content goes here
  \end{frame}
% etc
\end{document}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Frametitle_keyword_example.png|400px]]

The usual environments (&lt;tt&gt;itemize&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;enumerate&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;equation&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) may be used.

Inside frames, you can use environments like &lt;tt&gt;block&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;theorem&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;proof&lt;/tt&gt;, ... Also, &lt;tt&gt;\maketitle&lt;/tt&gt; is possible to create the frontpage, if &lt;tt&gt;title&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;author&lt;/tt&gt; are set.

Trick: Instead of using &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\begin{frame}...\end{frame}&lt;/source&gt;, you can also use &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\frame{...}&lt;/source&gt;.

For the actual talk, if you can compile it with &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; then you could use a pdf reader with a fullscreen mode, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okular Okular], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evince Evince] or Adobe Reader.  If you want to navigate in your presentation, you can use the almost invisible links in the bottom right corner without leaving the fullscreen mode.

=== Document Structure ===

==== Title page and information ====

You give information about authors, titles and dates in the preamble.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\title[Crisis] % (optional, only for long titles)
{The Economics of Financial Crisis}
\subtitle{Evidence from India}
\author[Author, Anders] % (optional, for multiple authors)
{F.~Author\inst{1} \and S.~Anders\inst{2}}
\institute[Universitäten Hier und Dort] % (optional)
{
  \inst{1}%
  Institut für Informatik\\
  Universität Hier
  \and
  \inst{2}%
  Institut für theoretische Philosophie\\
  Universität Dort
}
\date[KPT 2004] % (optional)
{Konferenz über Präsentationstechniken, 2004}
\subject{Informatik}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the document, you add the title page : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\frame{\titlepage}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Table of Contents ====
The table of contents, with the current section highlighted, is displayed by:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Table of Contents}
\tableofcontents[currentsection]
\end{frame}
&lt;/source&gt;

This can be done automatically at the beginning of each section using the following code in the preamble:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\AtBeginSection[]
{
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Table of Contents}
    \tableofcontents[currentsection]
  \end{frame}
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Or for subsections: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\AtBeginSubsection[]
{
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Table of Contents}
    \tableofcontents[currentsection,currentsubsection]
  \end{frame}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== References (Beamer) ====

Beamer does not officially support BibTeX.  Instead bibliography items will need to be partly set &quot;by hand&quot; (see [http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf beameruserguide.pdf 3.20]). The following example shows a references slide containing two entries:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
  \frametitle&lt;presentation&gt;{Weiterf¸hrende Literatur}    
  \begin{thebibliography}{10}    
  \beamertemplatebookbibitems
  \bibitem{Autor1990}
    A.~Autor.
    \newblock {\em Einf¸hrung in das Pr‰sentationswesen}.
    \newblock Klein-Verlag, 1990.
  \beamertemplatearticlebibitems
  \bibitem{Jemand2000}
    S.~Jemand.
    \newblock On this and that.
    \newblock {\em Journal of This and That}, 2(1):50--100, 2000.
  \end{thebibliography}
\end{frame}
&lt;/source&gt;

As the reference list grows, the reference slide will divide into two and so on, through use of the &lt;tt&gt;allowframebreaks&lt;/tt&gt; option.  Individual items can be cited after adding an 'optional' label to the relevant &lt;tt&gt;bibitem&lt;/tt&gt; stanza.  The citation call is simply &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\cite&lt;/source&gt;. Beamer also supports limited customization of the way references are presented (see the manual). Those who wish to use [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/natbib/ natbib], for example, with Beamer may need to troubleshoot both their document setup and the relevant BibTeX style file.

=== Style ===

==== Themes ====

The first solution is to use a built-in theme such as Warsaw, Berlin, etc. The second solution is to specify colors, inner themes and outer themes.

===== The Built-in solution =====

To the preamble you can add the following line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usetheme{Warsaw}
&lt;/source&gt;

to use the &quot;Warsaw&quot; theme. &lt;tt&gt;Beamer&lt;/tt&gt; has several themes, many of which are named after cities (e.g. Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin, etc.).

This [http://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/ Theme Matrix] contains the various theme and color combinations included with &lt;tt&gt;beamer&lt;/tt&gt;. For more customizing options, have a look to the official documentation included in your distribution of &lt;tt&gt;beamer&lt;/tt&gt;, particularly the part ''Change the way it looks''.

The full list of themes is:
{|
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Antibes
* Bergen
* Berkeley
* Berlin
* Copenhagen
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Darmstadt
* Dresden
* Frankfurt
* Goettingen
* Hannover
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Ilmenau
* JuanLesPins
* Luebeck
* Madrid
* Malmoe
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Marburg
* Montpellier
* PaloAlto
* Pittsburgh
* Rochester
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Singapore
* Szeged
* Warsaw
* boxes
* default
|}

Color themes, typically with animal names, can be specified with

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usecolortheme{beaver}
&lt;/source&gt;

The full list of color themes is:
{|
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* default
* albatross
* beaver
* beetle
* crane
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* dolphin
* dove
* fly
* lily
* orchid
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* rose
* seagull
* seahorse
* whale
* wolverine
|}

===== The ''do it yourself'' solution =====

First you can specify the ''outertheme''. The outertheme defines the head and the footline of each slide. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\useoutertheme{infolines} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a list of all available outer themes:
* infolines 
* miniframes
* shadow
* sidebar
* smoothbars
* smoothtree
* split
* tree

Then you can add the innertheme: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\useinnertheme{rectangles} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a list of all available inner themes: 

* rectangles
* circles
* inmargin
* rounded

You can define the color of every element: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\setbeamercolor{alerted text}{fg=orange}
\setbeamercolor{background canvas}{bg=white}
\setbeamercolor{block body alerted}{bg=normal text.bg!90!black}
\setbeamercolor{block body}{bg=normal text.bg!90!black}
\setbeamercolor{block body example}{bg=normal text.bg!90!black}
\setbeamercolor{block title alerted}{use={normal text,alerted text},fg=alerted text.fg!75!normal text.fg,bg=normal text.bg!75!black}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{bg=blue}
\setbeamercolor{block title example}{use={normal text,example text},fg=example text.fg!75!normal text.fg,bg=normal text.bg!75!black}
\setbeamercolor{fine separation line}{}
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{fg=brown}
\setbeamercolor{item projected}{fg=black}
\setbeamercolor{normal text}{bg=black,fg=yellow}
\setbeamercolor{palette sidebar primary}{use=normal text,fg=normal text.fg}
\setbeamercolor{palette sidebar quaternary}{use=structure,fg=structure.fg}
\setbeamercolor{palette sidebar secondary}{use=structure,fg=structure.fg}
\setbeamercolor{palette sidebar tertiary}{use=normal text,fg=normal text.fg}
\setbeamercolor{section in sidebar}{fg=brown}
\setbeamercolor{section in sidebar shaded}{fg=grey}
\setbeamercolor{separation line}{}
\setbeamercolor{sidebar}{bg=red}
\setbeamercolor{sidebar}{parent=palette primary}
\setbeamercolor{structure}{bg=black, fg=green}
\setbeamercolor{subsection in sidebar}{fg=brown}
\setbeamercolor{subsection in sidebar shaded}{fg=grey}
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=brown}
\setbeamercolor{titlelike}{fg=brown}
&lt;/source&gt;

Colors can be defined as usual: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\definecolor{chocolate}{RGB}{33,33,33}
&lt;/source&gt;

Block styles can also be defined: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\setbeamertemplate{blocks}[rounded][shadow=true]
\setbeamertemplate{background canvas}[vertical shading][bottom=white,top=structure.fg!25]
\setbeamertemplate{sidebar canvas left}[horizontal shading][left=white!40!black,right=black]
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also suppress the navigation bar: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\beamertemplatenavigationsymbolsempty 
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Fonts ====

You may also change the fonts for particular elements. If you wanted the title of the presentation as rendered by &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\frame{\titlepage}&lt;/source&gt; to occur in a serif font instead of the default sanserif, you would use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\setbeamerfont{title}{family=\rm}
&lt;/source&gt;

You could take this a step further if you are using OpenType fonts with Xe(La)TeX and specify a serif font with increased size and oldstyle proportional alternate number glyphs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\setbeamerfont{title}{family=\rm\addfontfeatures{Scale=1.18, Numbers={Lining, Proportional}}}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Math Fonts =====
The default settings for &lt;tt&gt;beamer&lt;/tt&gt; use a different set of math fonts than one would expect from creating a simple math article. One quick fix for this is to use at the beginning of the file the option &lt;tt&gt;mathserif&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[mathserif]{beamer}
&lt;/source&gt;

Others have proposed to use the command

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usefonttheme[onlymath]{serif}
&lt;/source&gt;

but it is not clear if this works for absolutely every math character.

=== Frames Options ===

The ''plain'' option. Sometimes you need to include a large figure or a large table and you don't want to have the bottom and the top of the slides. In that case, use the plain option : 
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\frame[plain]{
% ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to include lots of text on a slide, use the ''shrink'' option.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\frame[shrink]{
% ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''allowframebreaks'' option will auto-create new frames if there is too much content to be displayed on one.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\frame[allowframebreaks]{
% ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Before using any verbatim environment (like &lt;tt&gt;listings&lt;/tt&gt;), you should pass the option &lt;tt&gt;fragile&lt;/tt&gt; to the &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;frame&lt;/source&gt; environement, as verbatim environments need to be typeset differently.  Usually, the form &lt;tt&gt;fragile=singleslide&lt;/tt&gt; is usable (for details see the manual). Note that the &lt;tt&gt;fragile&lt;/tt&gt; option may not be used with &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\frame&lt;/source&gt; commands since it expects to encounter a &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\end{frame}&lt;/source&gt;, which should be alone on a single line.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Source code}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=First C example]
int main()
{
    printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Hyperlink navigation ===

Internal and external hyperlinks can be used in beamer to assist navigation.  Clean looking buttons can also be added.

{{TODO|
* add information about &lt;tt&gt;hyperref&lt;/tt&gt;
* add information about &lt;tt&gt;beamerbutton&lt;/tt&gt; and friends
}}

=== Animations ===

The following is merely an introduction to the possibilities in beamer.  Chapter 8 of the beamer manual provides much more detail, on many more features.

Making items appear on a slide is possible by simply using the &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\pause&lt;/source&gt; statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Some background}
We start our discussion with some concepts.
\pause
The first concept we introduce originates with Erd\H os.
\end{frame}
&lt;/source&gt;
Text or figures after &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\pause&lt;/source&gt; will display after one of the following events (which may vary between PDF viewers): pressing space, return or page down on the keyboard, or using the mouse to scroll down or click the next slide button.  Pause can be used within &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\itemize&lt;/source&gt; etc.

====Text animations====

For text animations, for example in the itemize environment, it is possible to specify appearance and disappearance of text by using &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;a-b&gt;&lt;/source&gt; where '''a''' and '''b''' are the numbers of the events the item is to be displayed for (inclusive).  For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{itemize}
  \item This one is always shown
  \item&lt;1-&gt; The first time (i.e. as soon as the slide loads)
  \item&lt;2-&gt; The second time
  \item&lt;1-&gt; Also the first time
  \only&lt;1-1&gt; {This one is shown at the first time, but it will hide soon (on the next event after the slide loads).}
\end{itemize}
&lt;/source&gt;

A simpler approach for revealing one item per click is to use &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\begin{itemize}[&lt;+-&gt;]&lt;/source&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{`Hidden higher-order concepts?'}
	\begin{itemize}[&lt;+-&gt;]
	\item The truths of arithmetic which are independent of PA in some 
	sense themselves `{contain} essentially {\color{blue}{hidden higher-order}},
	 or infinitary, concepts'???
	\item `Truths in the language of arithmetic which \ldots
	\item	That suggests stronger version of Isaacson's thesis. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
&lt;/source&gt;

In all these cases, pressing page up, scrolling up, or clicking the previous slide button in the navigation bar will backtrack through the sequence.

=== Handout mode===
In beamer class, the default mode is ''presentation'' which makes the slides. However, you can work in a different mode that is called ''handout'' by setting this option when calling the class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[12pt,handout]{beamer}
&lt;/source&gt;
This mode is useful to see each slide only one time with all its stuff on it, making any &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\itemize[&lt;+-&gt;]&lt;/source&gt; environments visible all at once (for instance, printable version). Nevertheless, this makes an issue when working with the &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;only&lt;/source&gt; command, because its purpose is to have ''only'' some text or figures at a time and not all of them together.

If you want to solve this, you can add a statement to specify precisely the behavior when dealing with &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;only&lt;/source&gt; commands in handout mode. Suppose you have a code like this
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\only&lt;1&gt;{\includegraphics{pic1.eps}}
\only&lt;2&gt;{\includegraphics{pic2.eps}}
&lt;/source&gt;
These pictures being completely different, you want them both in the handout, but they cannot be both on the same slide since they are large. The solution is to add the handout statement to have the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\only&lt;1| handout:1&gt;{\includegraphics{pic1.eps}}
\only&lt;2| handout:2&gt;{\includegraphics{pic2.eps}}
&lt;/source&gt;
This will ensure the handout will make a slide for each picture.

Now imagine you still have your two pictures with the only statements, but the second one show the first one plus some other graphs and you don't need the first one to appear in the handout. You can thus precise the handout mode not to include some only commands by:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\only&lt;1| handout:0&gt;{\includegraphics{pic1.eps}}
\only&lt;2&gt;{\includegraphics{pic2.eps}}
&lt;/source&gt;

The command can also be used to hide frames, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}&lt;handout:0&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
or even, if you have written a frame that you don't want anymore but maybe you will need it later, you can write
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}&lt;0| handout:0&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
and this will hide your slide in both modes. (The order matters. Don't put handout:0|beamer:0 or it won't work.)

A last word about the handout mode is about the notes. Actually, the full syntax for a frame is 
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}
...
\end{frame}
\note{...}
\note{...}
...
&lt;/source&gt;
and you can write your notes about a frame in the field ''note'' (many of them if needed). Using this, you can add an option to the class calling, either
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[12pt,handout,notes=only]{beamer}
&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[12pt,handout,notes=show]{beamer}
&lt;/source&gt;
The first one is useful when you make a presentation to have only the notes you need, while the second one could be given to those who have followed your presentation or those who missed it, for them to have both the slides with what you said.

Note that the 'handout' option in the \documentclass line suppress all the animations.

'''Important:''' the ''notes=only'' mode is '''literally''' doing only the notes. This means there will be no output file but the DVI. Thus it requires you to have run the compilation in another mode before. If you use separate files for a better distinction between the modes, you may need to copy the .aux file from the handout compilation with the slides (w/o the notes).

=== Columns and Blocks ===

There are two handy environments for structuring a slide: &quot;blocks&quot;, which divide the slide (horizontally) into headed sections, and &quot;columns&quot; which divides a slide (vertically) into columns.  Blocks and columns can be used inside each other.

==== Columns ====

Example
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}{Example of columns 1}
    \begin{columns}[c] % the &quot;c&quot; option specifies center vertical alignment
    \column{.5\textwidth} % column designated by a command
     Contents of the first column
    \column{.5\textwidth}
     Contents split \\ into two lines
    \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example of columns 2}
     \begin{columns}[t] % contents are top vertically aligned
     \begin{column}[T]{5cm} % each column can also be its own environment
     Contents of first column \\ split into two lines
     \end{column}
     \begin{column}[T]{5cm} % alternative top-align that's better for graphics
          \includegraphics[height=3cm]{graphic.png}
     \end{column}
     \end{columns}
\end{frame} 
&lt;/source&gt;
[[File:Latex Beamer - Columns Example 2.png|400px|Example of columns in Beamer]]

==== Blocks ====

Enclosing text in the ''block'' environment creates a distinct, headed block of text (a blank heading can be used). This allows to visually distinguish parts of a slide easily. There are three basic types of block. Their formatting depends on the theme being used.

Simple
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{frame}

   \begin{block}{This is a Block}
      This is important information
   \end{block}

   \begin{alertblock}{This is an Alert block}
   This is an important alert
   \end{alertblock}

   \begin{exampleblock}{This is an Example block}
   This is an example 
   \end{exampleblock}

\end{frame}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== PDF options ===

You can specify the default options of your PDF.&lt;ref&gt;Other possible values are defined in the [http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/tex/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/doc/manual.html#TBL-7-40-1 hyperref manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\hypersetup{pdfstartview={Fit}} % fits the presentation to the window when first displayed

&lt;/source&gt;

== The powerdot package ==

The powerdot package is available from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/powerdot/ CTAN].  The [http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/powerdot/docs/powerdot.pdf documentation] explains the features in great detail.

The powerdot package is loaded by calling the &lt;tt&gt;powerdot&lt;/tt&gt; class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass{powerdot}
&lt;/source&gt;
The usual header information may then be specified.

Inside the usual &lt;tt&gt;document&lt;/tt&gt; environment, multiple &lt;tt&gt;slide&lt;/tt&gt; environments specify the content to be put on each slide.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{document}
  \begin{slide}{This is the first slide}
    %Content goes here
  \end{slide}
  \begin{slide}{This is the second slide}
    %More content goes here
  \end{slide}
% etc
\end{document}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Consolidation Thoracic Radiotherapy==
*'''Kragujevac, Yugoslavia''' (1988-1993) -- Consolidation RT vs consolidation cisplatin/etoposide
**Randomized.  210 patients treated w/ 3 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide (PE).  Pts w/ distant-CR + local-CR/PR randomized to RT (54 Gy in 36 fx over 18 days) with concurrent carboplatin/etoposide followed by 2 more cycles of PE vs 4 additional cycles of PE.
**'''1999''' PMID 10561263  &quot;Role of radiation therapy in the combined-modality treatment of patients with extensive disease small-cell lung cancer: A randomized study.&quot; (Jeremic B et al. J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jul;17(7):2092-9.)
***Outcome: Median OS RT 17 months vs chemo 11 months (SS); 5-year OS 9% vs 4%. No difference in DMFS.
***Conclusion: Patients with good response to initial chemo may have improved overall survival with consolidative RT</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Evidence for Small Cell Lung Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;


In process of being cross-linked...


==Surgery vs. RT==
*'''LCSG 832''' -- Induction + surgery + RT vs Induction + RT
**Randomized. 328 registered, 146 randomized. Small cell lung cancer, limited stage (excluding SCV+ and positive pleural effusion), resectable disease after induction. Induction chemotherapy cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine x5 cycles. If CR/PR (66%), randomized to Arm 1) surgery vs Arm 2) no surgery. All patients subsequently underwent thoracic RT 50/25 and PCI 30/15
**'''1994''' PMID 7988254 -- &quot;A prospective randomized trial to determine the benefit of surgical resection of residual disease following response of small cell lung cancer to combination chemotherapy.&quot; (Lad T, Chest. 1994 Dec;106(6 Suppl):320S-323S.)
***Outcome: pCR 19%. 2-year OS 20% vs 20% (NS). Median OS for all patients 12 months, for randomized 16 months
***Conclusion: Results do not support addition of pulmonary resection to multimodality treatment

*'''MRC''' -- surgery vs. primary RT
**Randomized. 144 patients with small cell or oat cell carcinoma of the bronchus. Diagnosed on bronchial biopsy and thought to be operable. Arm 1) surgery vs. Arm 2) primary RT
**'''10-years; 1973''' PMID 4123619 -- &quot;Medical Research Council comparative trial of surgery and radiotherapy for primary treatment of small-celled or oat-celled carcinoma of bronchus. Ten-year follow-up.&quot; (Fox W, Lancet. 1973 Jul 14;2(7820):63-5.)
***Outcome: median OS surgery 6.5 months vs. RT 9.9 months (SS); 10-year OS 0% vs. 4%
***Conclusion: Radical RT provides better survival than surgery in operable patients

==Early vs Late Thoracic RT==
*'''London Lung Cancer Group''' (1993-1999) -- RT week 3 vs week 15
**Randomized. 325 patients. Attempted to replicate NCIC study. Cyclophosphamide + Doxorubicin + Vincristine alternating with Cisplatin + Etoposide x 3 cycles each.  RT dose was 40 Gy/15 fractions over 3 weeks. Arm 1) thoracic RT 40/15 week 3 vs Arm 2) thoracic RT 40/15 week 15. PCI 25/10 in patients with negative head CT after therapy
**'''2006''' PMID 16921033 &amp;mdash; &quot;Early compared with late radiotherapy in combined modality treatment for limited disease small-cell lung cancer: a London Lung Cancer Group multicenter randomized clinical trial and meta-analysis.&quot; (Spiro SG et al., J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 20;24(24):3823-30.)
***Outcome: Median OS early TRT 14 months vs late TRT 15 months (NS). Completion of all cycles of chemo early RT 69% vs late RT 80% (NS). Chest relapse early RT 26% vs. late RT 37% (SS)
***Toxicity: Early RT 39% vs late RT 23% (SS)
***Conclusion: No survival advantage for early thoracic RT

*'''Japanese JCOG 9104''' (1991-1995) -- RT week 1 vs. week 10
**Randomized. 231 pts. All pts received 4 cycles of cisplatin 80 mg/m2 + etoposide 100 mg/m2 chemotherapy. Randomized to: Arm 1) concurrent RT 45/30 BID starting day 2 vs Arm 2) sequential RT 45/30 BID based on pretreatment volumes. PCI 24/16 BID if CR/near CR
**'''2002''' PMID 12118018 &amp;mdash; &quot;Phase III study of concurrent versus sequential thoracic radiotherapy in combination with cisplatin and etoposide for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer: results of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study 9104.&quot; (Takada M et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jul 15;20(14):3054-60.)
***Outcome: 3-year OS concurrent 30% vs. sequential 20% (NS); 5-year OS 24% vs 18% (NS). After adjustment, hazard ratio for death in concurrent arm 0.7 (SS). Brain mets concurrent 19% vs sequential 27% (no p)
***Conclusion: Suggestion for benefit of concurrent vs sequential chemo-RT

*'''Kragujevac, Yugoslavia''' (1988-1992) -- RT week 1 vs week 6
**Randomized. 107 patients with LS-SCLC treated with ACC HFX RT 54 Gy in 1.5 Gy BID + concurrent carboplatin/etoposide, and 4 sequential cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. Timing randomized 1) Concurrent CRT at weeks 1-4 vs. 2) concurrent CRT at weeks 6-9. PCI if CR 
**'''1997''' PMID 9060525 -- &quot;Initial versus delayed accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy in limited small-cell lung cancer: a randomized study.&quot; (Jeremic B, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Mar;15(3):893-900.)
***Survival: median early 2.8 years vs. 2.2 years; 5-year 30% vs. 15% (SS). Higher LC but no difference in DM. Toxicity comparable
***Conclusion: Initial thoracic concurrent ACC HFX RT with chemo better LC and survival than delayed RT

*'''NCI Canada''' (1985-1988) -- RT during weeks 3-6 vs weeks 15-18
**Randomized. 308 patients with limited-stage SCLC. All received CAV (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine) x 3 alternating with EP (etoposide, cisplatin) x 3, every 3 weeks. Arm 1) Early thoracic RT to 40/15 concurrent with 2nd cycle of chemo (first cycle of EP; week 3) vs Arm 2) late thoracic RT concurrent with last cycle of EP (week 15).  PCI in patients without progressive disease.
**'''1993''' PMID 8381164 &amp;mdash; &quot;Importance of timing for thoracic irradiation in the combined modality treatment of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.&quot; (Murray N et al. J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):336-44.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: 3-year PFS early TRT 26% vs late TRT 19% (SS). 3-year OS 30% vs 21% (SS), 5-year OS 20% vs 11%. Isolated thoracic recurrence 19% vs 15% (NS), thoracic recurrence (isolated + elsewhere) 30% vs 30%. 
***Brain mets: before PCI early TRT 4% vs late RT 9% (NS), after PCI 13% vs 19% (NS), overall brain mets 18% vs 28% (SS)
***Conclusion: Early administration of thoracic RT is superior to later thoracic RT

*'''Denmark''' (1981-1989) -- RT week 1 vs RT week 18
**Randomized. 199 patients with limited stage SCLC. Chemotherapy cisplatin/etoposide x3 cycles and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine x6 cycles. Arm 1) Initial thoracic RT week 1 vs Arm 2) Late thoracic RT week 18. RT split course 22.5/11 - 21 days of chemotherapy - 22.5/11. PCI 25/11 added in 1984 for all patients
**'''1997''' PMID 9294465 -- &quot;Randomized study of initial versus late chest irradiation combined with chemotherapy in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. Aarhus Lung Cancer Group.&quot; (Work E, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Sep;15(9):3030-7.)
***Outcome: 2-year OS initial TRT 20% vs late TRT 19% (NS). 2-year local control 72% vs. 68% (NS). 2-year brain mets 19% vs 13% (NS)
***Conclusion: Timing of thoracic radiation didn't influence in-field recurrence, CNS recurrence, or overall survival

*'''CALGB 8083''' -- RT week 1 vs week 9 vs chemotherapy only

The MSP430 is a family of 16-bit RISC microcontrollers produced by Texas Instruments. The MSP430 microcontroller was developed at Texas Instruments in 1993. At the beginning Texas Instruments only offered the MSP430 in Europe. Since 1997 the MSP430 microcontroller family is offered world wide. 
The most important feature of the MSP430 is its low power consumption. However, the flexibility of its peripheral modules and the easy way to use it is the reason why this microcontroller is also used as a general purpose microcontroller.

== Architecture ==

The MSP430 microcontroller is based on a von-Neumann architecture. The MSP430 von-Neumann architecture has one address space shared with special function registers (SFRs), peripheral control registers, RAM, and Flash/ROM memory. 
At the moment there are two compatible CPUs existing within the MSP430 microcontroller family. The MSP430 CPU uses 16-bit CPU register and 16-bit Program Counter. This basically means that with such a CPU an address range of 64kBytes could be addressed. Due to the von-Neumann architecture the address range covers peripheral control registers (address 0x0000 to 0x01FF), RAM (starting at address 0x0200), and for example Flash memory (e.g. for an MSP430F169 the Flash memory starts at address 0x1000). So the MSP430 derivatives with the MSP430 CPU usually have a maximum Flash memory of 60KByte. The other CPU is the MSP430 CPUx (or MSP430X). This is an extended CPU. The CPU registers are 20-bit registers. Also the Program Counter is a 20-bit register, which allows to address memory above the 64KByte limit that was seen before. Usually all MSP430s with a Flash memory above 60kByte Flash have the CPUx. Because the CPUx is based on MSP430 CPU the software that was written on a MSP430 CPU device is also running on MSP430 CPUx chips.

== Peripheral Modules ==


=== Analog Peripheral Modules ===

==== ADC12 ====
The ADC12 module is a 12-bit SAR A/D converter. There is an input multiplexer that allows to select different internal or external analog input signals. Internal analog signals are a temperature sensor signal, half of the supply voltage (that could be used for a battery check), or the external positive and negative reference voltages. Sample rate can be adjusted by software and it can be up to 200ksps. Sample time can be defined by an integrated Sample Timer, by software using a control bit, or by output signals of Timer modules that are also available on MSP430. There are external pins or an integrated reference that can be selected as a reference voltage for the A/D converter core. The internal reference can be switched in 2.5V or 1.5V mode. Separate activation of the reference and ADC core allows reduction of current consumption.

==== ADC10 ====
The ADC10 module looks similar like the ADC12. The ADC10 module is a SAR A/D converter. There is an integrated reference (1.5V, 2.5V, or external reference can be chosen). A sample timer allows the adjustment of the sample time. Beside the analog inputs there is also the possibility to choose a Vcc half voltage or a temperature sensor signal (integrated temperature sensor) as the analog input signal. Vcc half voltage can be used to measure the battery voltage that is usually directly applied to the Vcc pins of the MSP430. Main difference compared with ADC12 is the realization of the autoscan function. The ADC10 module uses a Data Transfer Controller (DTC) to move the conversion results to a definable source address - this means conversion results can be stored in RAM, Flash, or peripheral control registers. The sample rate of the ADC10 module is also in the range of up to 200ksps. 

==== DAC12 ====
The DAC12 module is a 12-bit monotonic voltage output D/A converter. Usually there are existing several DAC channels (up to 2). It can be configured in 8-bit or 12-bit output resolution. It was designed for optimized power consumption. So features can be found like programmable settling time versus power consumption. It is possible to select either the ADC12 reference or an external reference voltage as the reference voltage for the DAC12. Self-calibration option for offset correction and synchronized update capability for multiple DAC12 channels are available.

==== Analog Comparator ====
The Comparator_A or Comparator_A+ modules are analog comparators. It is possible to choose chip internal thresholds (0.25*Vcc, 0.5*Vcc, or a diode voltage as reference or temperature sensor). The internal connection of the comparator output to a capture input of a timer module allows charge/discharge time measurements, which makes it simple to realize a resistive measurement (e.g. using NTC to measure temperature). Especially ratiometric measurements allow to do conversion with a resolution of around 11-bits and higher.

=== Digital Peripheral Modules ===

== Development Tools ==

=== A simple and cheap Starter Kit (eZ430-F2013) ===
This is a simple and cheap tool that is perfect to start with MSP430. It supports the MSP430F20x1, MSP430F20x2, and MSP430F20x3 devices. The eZ430-F2013 tool looks like an USB Stick. The USB stick consist of two parts. First the USB emulator and a removable target board. The eZ430-F2013 is delivered with one target board that uses an MSP430F2013. If someone wants to use an MSP430F2012 instead of the 'F2013 there are also a kit with 3 eZ430 target boards using MSP430F2012 available (eZ430-T2012). 

=== A cheap wireless Starter Kit (eZ430-RF2500) ===
This one uses the same USB emulator than the eZ430-F2013. However, there are different target boards that uses beside an MSP430F2274 and CC2500. The kit is delivered with 2 RF boards, one battery holder, the USB emulator, and a CD ROM.

=== The LaunchPad (MSP-EXP430G2) ===
A very low-cost ($4.30) experimenter's board created with beginners and hobbyists in mind. Comes as a complete, assembled product (except for the header pins) with two MSP430 controllers, an external crystal, a USB cable, and freely downloadable development environments.

&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== About This Gadget ==

This gadget is designed to be a high-level, user-friendly way to automate the process of creating a new book here on Wikibooks. This gadget, the Visual Book Designer, works like a regular outlining tool. For each point in the outline, you have the option to add subpoints (subpages or page headings), or to modify the point (rename, delete, etc). When the gadget page loads, you should see something similar to this:

{{TextBox|1=
'''&lt;big&gt;New Book&lt;/big&gt;''' - [[#Templates Menu|Templates]] - [[#File Menu|File]] - [[#Options Menu|Options]] - [[#Clear Outline|Clear]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; [[#Creating Page Headings|Headings [+]]] - [[#Creating Subpages|Subpages [+]]] - [[#Viewing Wikitext|Wikitext]] - [[#Editing and Saving|Edit]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;[Click here to edit page text]&lt;/small&gt;}}

This looks like a lot of options! Creating a book does require an author to make many decisions, although luckily a lot of decisions have default values that you don't need to change. The sections below will discuss these options and how they can be used to shape your new book. You should feel free to experiment with this tool, in addition to reading this documentation. However, you should be careful because some buttons can have consequences. Some parts of this tool will open an edit window where you are able to save changes to pages elsewhere in the wiki.

{{info|There is a short tutorial about how to use this gadget, with pictures [http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/2008/04/visual-book-designer.html on my blog]}}

'''Warning: This tool allows you to make edits to other pages in the wiki without first viewing those pages. Do not save page changes if you are not sure you want to create a new page or possibly overwrite an existing page. Abusing this tool is no different from abusing the edit function on any other page, and will be taken very seriously.'''

=== Note on Terminology ===

Outlines are shaped like &quot;trees&quot; from computer science fields, or &quot;graphs&quot; from mathematics fields. Each page or heading in the outline is a point called a &quot;node&quot;. A node has a single &quot;parent&quot;, and multiple &quot;children&quot;. For a page node, the children can be headings or subpages of that page.

The top node, the node that has children but no parent, is called the &quot;root node&quot;. In terms of books, the root node is the main page of the book, the table of contents. Children nodes of the root node are the pages and headings that appear on the table of contents. 

== Book Menus ==

=== Naming your Book ===

Naming or renaming your book is very easy. In fact, renaming any page or heading is easy too: Click on the page title to open an edit box. Enter the new name and click {{key|rename}}. If you want to delete the page instead, click {{Key|delete}} instead. You cannot delete the book itself, but you can click '''Clear''' to delete your entire outline and start over from scratch.

=== Templates Menu ===

The '''Templates''' menu gives the option to create and specify templates for categorization and navigation.

Provided with this gadget are a list of 5 pre-made navigation templates. These templates are very simple and plain, but they are effective and customizable. They provide a good starting point for your book, and from there you can get more creative once your book has been created. You don't need to use these premade templates in your book, but it's one less thing to worry about up front. This is a wiki, so things can always change later as your book evolves.

Select a template from the drop-down box and click {{Key|Make Template}}. This will open an edit window where you can view and possibly modify the template text before you save it. Clicking {{Key|Save page}}, like usual, will save this text and create your new template. For more documentation about these templates and how they are used, see [[User:Whiteknight/Book Foundry#Header Templates|Whiteknight's Book Foundry]] page.

;Simple Header:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;PrettyTextBox noprint&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; clear: all; padding: 5px; margin: 5px auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''[[My Book]]'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

;Header with forward/back links:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;PrettyTextBox noprint&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; clear: all; padding: 5px; margin: 5px auto;&quot;&gt;&amp;larr; [[My Book/Page1|Page 1]] &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;[[My Book]]&lt;/big&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;[[My Book/Page 3|Page 3]] → &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

;Page List Header:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;PrettyTextBox noprint&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; clear: all; padding: 5px; margin: 5px auto;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;[[My Book]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt; [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Resources|Resources]] - [[My Book/Licensing|Licensing]] - [[Talk:My Book|Discuss]] &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

;Page list header with forward/back links:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;PrettyTextBox noprint&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; clear: all; padding: 5px; margin: 5px auto;&quot;&gt;&amp;larr; [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp; '''&lt;big&gt;[[My Book]]&lt;/big&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; [[My Book/Page 3|Page 3]] → 
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Page 1|Page 1]] - [[My Book/Resources|Resources]] - [[My Book/Licensing|Licensing]] - [[Talk:My Book|Discuss]] &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In addition to these header templates you can specify the book's [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels|reading level]] and select categories that the book is in, for organization.

=== File Menu ===

The file menu gives a number of options for loading in pre-made books in a number of formats, and saving your outline into a number of formats. 
;Outlines: If you are working on your outline actively and it is incomplete, but you need to save it for later, you can save the outline to a page in your user namespace. In the file menu on the line marked &quot;Saved Outlines&quot;, you can '''Save''' your current outline or '''Load''' a previously saved outline. Saved outlines will come with a link you can click to open the editor and load the outline in again.
:{{User:Whiteknight/Color|Red|Warning:}} Saved outlines are not perfect, they do not reproduce most configured options and they are not guaranteed to reproduce your outline perfectly.
;Collections: You can load an outline from a personal or public collection page, or you can create a new collection page from an existing outline. Click '''Save''' to create a saved collection page, and click '''Load''' to load an outline from an existing collection page. Collections can be personal (in your user namespace) or they can be public (at [[Wikibooks:Collections]]).
;Existing Books: You can load the TOC from an existing book into the gadget for manipulation. Once you have an outline you can use the wikitext options on each page, or you can click '''Create''' to active the book creation automator. The automator will create all the pages in your book automatically, using the structure and text in the outline.
:{{User:Whiteknight/Color|red|Warning:}} Only administrators can use the '''Create''' feature. This is for testing purposes now, and may be opened up to a wider audience of editors later.
;Print Versions:Print versions are deprecated now that we have [[Help:Collections|collections]]. However, you can still create them if you want. Click '''Save''' to create a new print version for an existing book from the outline, and click '''View''' to see the wikitext without opening an editor.

Notice that this tool can be used for more then just creating new books. Using the '''Load TOC''' feature, existing books can be loaded into the gadget and then used to create collections and print versions for the book.

=== Options Menu ===

The options menu gives you control over a number of options about the book.

inherit page text by default
;collapse nodes by default: When you create nodes, they start collapsed by default. This means you have to open them to see subpages and headings.
;add a resources page by default: Automatically create a page named &quot;Resources&quot; in the book, even if it's not in the outline.
;add a licensing page by default: Automatically create a page named &quot;Licensing&quot; in the book, even if it's not in the outline.
;add an introduction page by default: Automatically create a page named &quot;Introduction&quot; in the book, even if it's not in the outline.
;add [[Wikibooks:Collections Preface]] to Collections by default: When saving a collection, add the page [[Wikibooks:Collections Preface]] to it.
;use page comments to create talk pages: NOT USED. I haven't implemented this behavior, so it doesnt do anything.
;make edits in an external tab or window: When checked, all editors will open in an external tab or window. If unchecked, editors will be created inline in the gadget.

=== Clear Outline ===

Clears the outline so you can start fresh. If you have something that you want to keep in the gadget, make sure you save it first before you clear the outline. Once cleared, there is no way to undo or go back.

== Page Menus ==

Pages are the fundamental part of any book. Each page in your outline has a number of options.

=== Creating Page Headings ===

Each page may contain headings to break up content into smaller blocks. To create a new heading on your page, click the '''[ + ]''' link next to the word &quot;headings&quot;. This will create a new heading in the outline with a default name that you can change later. If you would like to create multiple headings at once, you can click the word '''headings''' to open an edit box. Enter the names of all the headings you want to add in the box, one per line, and click {{key|Save}}.

=== Creating Subpages ===

Creating subpages is the same as creating page headings. Click the '''[ + ]''' link to create a new subpage in the outline. Click '''Subpages''' to open an edit box where you ca enter the names of subpages, one per line, and then click {{key|Save}}.

=== Viewing Wikitext ===

To view the wikitext of a page, click the '''Wikitext''' link. This will display the wikitext for the current page for review.

=== Editing and Saving ===

If you like what the wikitext looks like, you can actually create the page using the '''Edit''' link. This will open an edit window preloaded with the text of the page. Review and possibly preview the text, and then click {{key|Save page}} to save the page.

=== Text and Comments ===

Under each page and heading node there are two lines of text, &quot;Click here to edit page text&quot;, and &quot;Click here to edit comments&quot;. Clicking on either of these two lines will open an edit box where you can edit the text of the page directly, or where you can post comments.

The page text is the text that will actually appear on the page when it is edited and saved. If the &quot;inherit?&quot; checkbox is checked, the page will also include text from it's parent page too. This is a good way to add basic text to all pages, or all subpages of a given page at once. Keep in mind that this is not intended to used for creating the complete text of a page. This editor is simply not robust enough for large-scale text and collaborative editing. What it does do, however, is allow you to create some basic stub text to get the page started. Once the page is created on the wiki, you and other editors will be able to edit and expand the pages as normal.

Comments are notes which are visible in the outline, but which do not appear in the book when you create it. Comments are used to help you, the author, stay organized while outlining. At any time, you can click the text or the comments to edit them again.

== Loading an Outline ==

You can load a previously-saved outline at any time, when you want to continue working on it. Click the '''load''' link to open a text box where you can enter the name of the page to load the outline from. Once you have entered the name, click {{Key|Load}} to load the outline into the gadget automatically. if the load operation fails for any reason, nothing will be loaded and an error message will be displayed.

On an outline page, you will see a message similar to the following:

{{User:Whiteknight/SavedOutlineStart|noheading=true}}

Clicking the &quot;Edit This Outline In The Gadget&quot; link will open the Visual Book Designer and automatically load that outline.

== To Do ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|feature|Add a &quot;Design!&quot; link, or similar, to the upper-right corner of the page}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|feature|Add some kind of roll-over effect. If you rest your mouse over a page name, display a floating box with options about the page including: the fully-qualified page name, the fully-qualified name of the parent page, a status check to determine whether the page currently exists or not, etc.}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|feature|Add Drag-n-Drop node reordering.}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|suggestion|Add timeouts on some of the AJAX requests, and callbacks to use on failure. Will probably require massive changes to the wkgadgetscore library}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|suggestion|Consider using JSON as a storage format for new outlines}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|feature|&quot;Full Screen&quot; mode}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|suggestion|Port this gadget to use JQuery}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|suggestion|Modify this to be an extension, in addition to a gadget. Create a Special:BookCreator page instead of having a page here in my user namespace}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|feature|Make menus into normal &quot;dropdown&quot; menus}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|feature|Improve UI all around}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Faerie Queene''''' is an epic poem by the English poet [[:w:en:Edmund Spenser|Edmund Spenser]], published in its final form in 1596. The poem follows two knights, Redcrosse and Britomart, as they struggle against various obstacles. The ''Faerie Queene'' is also an allegory in which each book demonstrates and promotes a certain virtue. Although Spenser had originally planned to write 24 books, only six books are known to have been completed. Fragments of a seventh book exist in what are called the ''Cantos of Mutabilitie''.

==The Six Books==
*[[/Book I/|Book I: The First Booke of The Faerie Queene, Contayning The Legende of the Knight of the Red Crosse, or Of Holinesse]]
*[[/Book II/]]
*[[/Book III/]]
*[[/Book IV/]]
*[[/Book V/]]
*[[/Book VI/]]

==Introduction==
The ''loglog'' command plots both x and y data sets on a log scale while the ''plot'' command plots both axes on linear scales and the ''semilogx/y'' command plots 1 axis on a linear scale and the other axis on a log scale.  Other than the scale of the axes, the 3 plotting commands are identical in most ways.

==Basic Usage==
The basic usage of the ''plot'', ''semilogx/y'', and ''loglog'' command are identical.  Below is an example of how a PSD would be plotted
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
  &gt;&gt; Fs = 1000;                              % Sample Rate of 1 kHz
  &gt;&gt; t = 0:(1/Fs):1000;                      % Time vector
  &gt;&gt; x = sin(pi*t);                          % Sine wave based on time vector
  &gt;&gt; [Pxx, f] = pwelch(x, [], [], [], Fs);
  &gt;&gt; loglog(f, Pxx)
  &gt;&gt; grid on
  &gt;&gt; xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
  &gt;&gt; ylabel('Magnitude (units^2/Hz)')
  &gt;&gt; title('PSD of Sine Wave')
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Note that this page is a copy of the ControlTheoryPro.com page on semilogx/y commands.

==Introduction==
The ''semilogx'' or ''semilogy'' commands plot data with 1 axis linear and the other axis log scale.  The ''semilogx'' command plots the data on the x-axis on a log scale.  For controls this is particularly useful when manually creating a [[MATLAB Bode Plot|bode plot]].

==Bode Plots==
The MATLAB bode plot is very convenient but when the plot needs to be formatted then the bode command makes this difficult.  As a result this author ([[User:Spradlig|Gabe]] 13:30, 20 April 2008 (CDT)) creates bode plots using the following commands

&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
freqVec = logspace(-1, 3, 5000);
[mag, phs] = bode(sys, freqVec * (2*pi));
mag = db(mag(:));
phs = phs(:);
figure;
subplot(2, 1, 1)
semilogx(freqVec, mag)
grid on
title('System Bode Plot')
ylabel('Magnitude (dB)')
subplot(2, 1, 2)
semilogx(freqVec, phs)
grid on
ylabel('Phase (deg)')
xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
&lt;/source&gt;

== Math markup ==

Hi Neocrac,

I was noticing your work in the Algebra book and thought you might like to know about the math markup capabilities of the Wiki software.  For instance, you could write:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{x+1} + \frac{3x}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;

This looks a little better than spacing over and using underlines.  See [[Help:Formula]] for more capabilities. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:11, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

RATIO h,v 

=== Description === 

This statement affects the width and height of shapes subsequently drawn with the CIRCLE statement. By suitably setting the h and v parameters, you can draw ellipses with any aspect ratio. Each of h and v can range in value from -128 to +127. The h parameter affects the width of the ellipse, and the v parameter affects its height. When you subsequently execute a CIRCLE statement with a radius parameter of radius, a circle or ellipse is drawn which has these dimensions: Shape's width = 2 * radius * (1 + h /128)
Shape's height = 2 * radius * (1 + v /128) We can notice a few consequences of these formulas:
If h and v are equal, a circle is drawn.
If h and v are different, an ellipse is drawn.
If h &gt; v, the ellipse is wider than it is tall.
If v &gt; h, the ellipse is taller than it is wide.
Negative values of h or v cause the corresponding dimension to shrink. Positive values cause the corresponding dimension to grow (up to about twice its original size).
Specifying RATIO 0,0 &quot;resets&quot; the ratios: subsequent CIRCLE statements will draw a circle with the indicated radius.
After you execute a RATIO statement, the indicated h and v values remain in effect for all subsequent CIRCLE statements (in all windows), until another RATIO statement is executed.

RANDOM[IZE] [expr] 

=== Description === 

This statement &quot;seeds&quot; the random number generator: this affects the sequence of values which are subsequently returned by the RND function and the MAYBE function. The numbers returned by RND and MAYBE are not truly random, but follow a &quot;pseudo-random&quot; sequence which is uniquely determined by the seed number. If you use the same seed number on two different occasions, you'll get the same sequence of &quot;random&quot; numbers both times. For example: CLS
FOR i = 1 TO 2
  RANDOMIZE 325
  FOR j = 1 TO 10
PRINT RND(50),
  NEXT
  PRINT
NEXT The program above seeds the random number generator twice with the same number (325). If you run this program, you'll find that it produces the same sequence of 10 random numbers after each seeding. Seeding the random number generator with a pre-specified number can be useful in cases where you specifically want to produce a repeatable sequence of random numbers. In most cases, however, you will probably prefer a sequence that is unpredictable. In that case, you should omit the expr parameter. When you execute RANDOM without any expr parameter, the system's current time is used to seed the random number generator. Since the system clock changes very quickly, it's essentially impossible to predict what value will be used as the seed-this is the best way to get the &quot;most random&quot; random numbers. Normally, you will execute RANDOM only once in your program, unless you wish to repeat a specific sequence of random numbers. If you don't execute RANDOM at all, the random number generator is seeded with the current tick count. Remember that re-seeding with the same number will cause your program to generate the same sequence of random numbers each time it's run.

READ

=== Description === 

This statement reads one or more of the items listed in one or more DATA statements. If you specify var (which must be either a numeric variable or a string variable), the data item's value is stored into var. If you specify PSTR$(addressVar&amp;), the item is interpreted as a string and its address is stored into addressVar&amp; (which must be a long-integer variable or a POINTER variable). Each var or PSTR$ that you specify causes one data item to be read. The first time your program executes a READ statement, the first item in your program's first DATA statement is read. Every time a var or PSTR$ is encountered in any READ statement, the next data item is read, until all items in all your program's DATA statements have been exhausted. The number of var or PSTR$ specifications in a READ statement does not need to match the number of items in a DATA statement; however, the total number of read requests should not exceed the total number of items in all DATA statements (unless you use the RESTORE statement, which allows you to re-use data from previous DATA statements). 

Example:
DATA 1,2
DATA 3,4
DATA 5,6
FOR i = 1 TO 2
   READ a, b, c
   PRINT a, b, c
NEXT program output:
123
456

READ

=== Description === 

This statement reads data from the open file or serial port specified by deviceID, and stores the data into the indicated variable(s). You can read the data into record variables (recVar), into numeric variables (numVar) or into string variables (strVar$), or any combination of these. If you specify recVar or numVar, the statement reads a number of bytes equal to the size of the variable, and stores the bytes directly into the variable's location in memory, without doing any data conversion. If you specify strVar$;len, the statement reads len bytes, and stores them into strVar$ as a Pascal string of length len (len can be any numeric expression, but its value should not exceed 255). The read operation begins at the current location of the &quot;file mark,&quot; and the file mark is advanced as each item is read. If READ# attempts to read past the end of the file, FB generates an error. Because READ# copies the file's bytes directly into memory without conversion, it's best suited for reading &quot;binary&quot; information, such as that created by the WRITE# statement. To read file data which is formatted as text, it's usually better to use the INPUT# statement. To read an arbitrary number of bytes into a block of memory, use the READ FILE statement.

READ DYNAMIC  

=== Revised === 

May, 2001 (Release 5) 

=== Description === 

Use READ DYNAMIC to read the contents of a dynamic array from a disk file. Before executing this read statement, you must dimension the dynamic array. The following example creates and fills a dynamic array, writes the array to disk, then reads it back into memory. FOR x = 1 TO 100
  myAry(x) = x

NEXT OPEN &quot;O&quot;,#1,&quot;Dynamic Array Test&quot;

WRITE DYNAMIC #1,myAry

CLOSE #1 KILL DYNAMIC myary 

OPEN &quot;I&quot;,#1,&quot;Dynamic Array Test&quot;

READ DYNAMIC #1,myAry

CLOSE #1 FOR x = 1 TO 10
  PRINT myary(x)

NEXT KILL &quot;Dynamic Array Test&quot;

READ FIELD 

=== Description === 

This statement creates a new relocatable block in memory, reads data from the open file or serial port specified by deviceID into the new block, and returns a handle to the block into handleVar, which must be a long-integer variable or a HANDLE variable. The data in the file (or coming in through the serial port) must be in a particular format in order to be read properly. The first 4 bytes (at the current &quot;file mark&quot; position) must be a long integer which indicates the size of the block to create. This should be immediately followed by the data which is to go into the block. This is the format in which the WRITE FIELD statement writes to a file; almost always, the data you read with READ FIELD will have been created using a WRITE FIELD statement. 

Note:
Your program is responsible for disposing of the handle returned in handleVar when you're finished using the block. You can use a statement such as DEF DISPOSEH or KILL FIELD to do this.

READ FILE 

=== Description === 

This statement reads numBytes&amp; bytes from the open file or serial port specified by deviceID (starting at the current &quot;file mark&quot; position), and copies them into memory starting at the address specified by address. This is the fastest way to read large amounts of data from a file; it's also well suited for reading data whose format you may not know in advance. 

Example: This program fragment quickly loads an array with the data read from a file. It's assumed that the binary image of the array was previously saved to the file using a statement like WRITE FILE (see the example accompanying the WRITE FILE statement). _

Note: If READ FILE attempts to read past the end of the file (because numBytes&amp; was too large), FB generates an error.

REC(fileID) 

=== Description === 

This function returns the record number of the record where the &quot;file mark&quot; is currently located, in the open file specified by fileID. The first record in the file is considered Record #0. To calculate the record number, REC uses the record length that was specified in the OPEN statement when the file was opened. If no record length was specified, a default length of 256 bytes is used. If you specified a record length of &quot;1&quot; when you opened the file, REC returns the file mark's byte position within the file. 

Note: To determine the file mark's offset from the beginning of the record, use the LOC function.

RECORD  

=== Description === 

This statement sets the &quot;file mark&quot; position, in the open file specified by fileID. The position of the file mark determines the location in the file where the next input or output operation will occur. If you omit the positionInRecord parameter, RECORD places the file mark at the beginning of the record indicated by recordNum (the first record in the file is considered Record #0). If you specify positionInRecord, the file mark is placed at an offset of positionInRecord bytes past the beginning of the indicated record. RECORD uses the record length that was specified in the OPEN statement when the file was opened. If no record length was specified, a default length of 256 bytes is used. If you specified a record length of &quot;1&quot; when you opened the file, you can set the file mark to a particular byte offset from the beginning of the file using a statement like this:    RECORD [#]fileID, byteOffset&amp; 

Note: The file mark position is also moved automatically after every input or output operation on the file.

REGISTER(A5) 

=== Description === 

This function returns the value of the system global variable currentA5. The currentA5 value is a pointer to a location within the memory space allotted for your program; every currently running program has its own individual currentA5 value. currentA5 points to the first byte of your program's application parameters. The memory space immediately preceding the location pointed to by currentA5 contains your program's global variables. See the &quot;Introduction to Memory Management&quot; chapter in Inside Macintosh: Memory for more information.
This function is available only for 68K compilation.
